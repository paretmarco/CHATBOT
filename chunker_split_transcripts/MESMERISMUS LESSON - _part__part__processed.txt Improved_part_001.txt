Using , Connecting , and Correcting Automatically Transcribed Text : Lesson on Presence and Hypnosis Greetings everyone ! It 's great to see you all here . I am Leah David , and joining me today are Catherine Amaso , Andrew McDonald , and Fabian . I believe some others will be joining us soon as well . I noticed that the automatic transcription has translated parts of our conversation into French and Spanish , but let 's stick to English for this lesson . Before we begin , I want to remind you that if you have any questions , please feel free to ask me or anyone else here . Just click the button and speak up . Marco , you had a question about working with a client who struggles with alcohol addiction . While the Campanelli method can be helpful , I have a few additional tips that might be effective . For instance , you can work with the sensation of wine by suggesting that it tastes like vinegar . Another technique is to suggest sleep to the person , as drinking is often a way to escape reality . We will discuss this topic more in the advanced lessons . Fabian , you asked about the effectiveness of using a ball of light to help your client with alcohol addiction . While a ball of light can be helpful for neuromuscular attention and activating parasympathetic states , it 's not specific to alcohol addiction . Instead , try using a real light source . Now , let 's move on to today 's lesson , which is all about presence . We will be doing the `` Lucy exercise , '' which involves catalepsy , local blockage , and other techniques to help you become more present . Additionally , there will be exercises to strengthen your eyes and work on your personal relationships . Remember , if you have no clients at the moment , work on yourself . Practicing the techniques I give you will make you more charismatic and reliable , which will benefit you in all aspects of life . And do n't forget to ask questions ! The more you ask , the more you 'll learn . Thank you all for being here today , and let 's get started with the fifth week of our program . In this text , we explore the concept of personal magnetism and how it can be developed through presence and awareness of the body . We begin by discussing the Lucy exercise , which involves rocking on catalepsi local blockage and working on strengthening and speeding up the eyes . We also emphasize the importance of presence in increasing magnetism and developing personal magnetism . To illustrate the concept of presence , we conduct an exercise with the participants where they speak and focus on their body and surroundings . We observe how their voices change as they become more present and aware of their body . We also discuss the importance of being present when speaking with clients and how it can affect their perception of us . Finally , we provide two techniques to maintain presence and awareness of the body , which can be useful in developing personal magnetism . These techniques can help individuals stay grounded and centered even in high-pressure situations . Overall , this text emphasizes the importance of presence and awareness of the body in developing personal magnetism and effectively communicating with others . It provides practical exercises and techniques to help individuals cultivate these qualities and develop a magnetic presence that can help them succeed in various aspects of life . Title : Techniques for Building Presence Building presence is essential to living a conscious and focused life . However , it can be challenging to maintain a high level of presence amidst the constant barrage of distractions in modern life .

Keeping Attention on One Hand or Foot One simple technique for building presence is keeping attention on one hand or foot . By simply being aware of the sensation in one part of the body , we can increase our physical awareness and prevent our mind from getting clogged by distractions .

By doing so , we can become more aware of our physical sensations and increase our overall level of presence . The Importance of Remembering to Be Present While this technique is simple , it can be easy to forget to implement it in our daily lives . However , the most important thing is to remember to be present , even if we lose focus momentarily . It 's like losing a sword in a battle - we just need to pick it up again and continue fighting .
