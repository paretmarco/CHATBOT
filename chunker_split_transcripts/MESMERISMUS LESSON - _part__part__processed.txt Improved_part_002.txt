Using , Connecting , and Correcting This Automatically Transcribed Text Sometimes , thinking too much can lead to overthinking , just as eating too much can become unnatural . Aristoba explains that people who struggle with presence often lack a solid basis and may have difficulty maintaining it for an extended period of time . Although you can construct presence with attention , it is not the same as natural verticality , which should be effortless , like a small child 's posture . When it comes to individuals with personality disorders like sociopaths and narcissists , their natural charisma may seem like a survival mechanism . However , this presence is often possessive and not a true representation of natural presence . True presence is more human and does not cut off emotions . It is about being the master of your emotions and not the slave to them . To differentiate between natural and unnatural presence , observe body language . A person with natural presence is more human and does not cut off emotions . They master their emotions and are not slave to them . An example of natural presence is a person waiting for someone with sunflowers . If the person does not show up , they are not overly upset and can move on . In conclusion , natural presence is about creating energy in a natural way . It is effortless and not possessive . By mastering your emotions , you can achieve true presence .
