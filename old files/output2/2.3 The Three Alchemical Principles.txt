Search snippet response: [{'response': '\n\nThe three alchemical principles are Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral.

Additionally, these principles are used to describe the ascension of Venus-Urania, or the Babylonians Ishtar, who creates all the idealistic shapes or the idea-types which give order to all of creation, and reigns in the sublime regions of pure intellect, high above the ever-changing sphere of the sub-lunar world, which nevertheless is destined to submit to her in the end.'}]
