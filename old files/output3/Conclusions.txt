Search snippet response: [{'response': '\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from this information is that fascination is a powerful tool that can be used to influence the mental and physical state of a person. It can be used to alter sensory perceptions, induce a state of relaxation, and even cause a person to commit an act in the future. Fascination works by manipulating the eye\'s accommodation, using dark focus, retinal locus, spatial frequency, and sharpness of focus. It can also be used to create a "big face" effect, the Mandelbaum effect, and to enter the subject\'s microcosm. Additionally, it can be used to fixate attention and blur peripheral vision, as well as to excite the unconscious through central and peripheral vision. Circular movements can be used to prepare the real fascination work, as they tend to excite the mind in a specific way. Furthermore, cone (central) vision is processed consciously, whereas rod (peripheral) vision is processed subconsciously. Fascination is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad, and it is important to use it responsibly.'}]
