2.1 The Four Classical Elements
The four classical elements have been a part of human understanding for thousands of years. Their importance can be seen not just in ancient mythologies and philosophies, but in modern science as well. Each element has its own unique properties and characteristics that are essential to understanding the world around us.


2.1.1 Earth
Earth, the first element in the classical Greek tradition, has been revered for centuries as the basis for all physical existence. From the mountains that tower above us to the fertile soil that supports our crops, Earth is the foundation upon which all life depends. In ancient times, Earth was associated with the goddess Gaia, who was believed to be the mother of all creation.


2.1.2 Air
Air is a vital element in our daily lives. It is the element that we breathe in every moment, providing us with the energy and oxygen we need to survive. Air is essential for the circulation of the life force energy, which flows through our bodies and helps to keep us healthy and balanced.

2.2 The Quintessence
The quintessence is a powerful concept that has been used for centuries to describe a state of balance and harmony. It is the fifth element that completes the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth. The quintessence is also known as the “aether”, which is a substance that fills the universe and is believed to be the medium through which light and gravity travel.
