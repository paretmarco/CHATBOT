Earth is associated with physical body, Air with the breath of life, Water with bodily fluids, and Fire with the life force energy. These elements are believed to be the building blocks of all matter and are essential for the cycle of life. They are also believed to be the source of all heat and energy, and are reunited in the psyche of man. Additionally, the four classical elements are also associated with the spiritual Sun, Ethereal Soul, Emotional spirit or spiritual soul, Corporeal spirit, Corporeal soul, and Body. The spiritual Sun represents the divine Light which makes our self lighter, but without weakening it; more specifically our emotional Spirit, upon which our Jupiterian awareness is focused. The force that commands us comes from the Spirit and from the Soul, which shapes our emotions and forms ideals and images that help us to think and remember. The bodily Spirit is the source of the physical body, while the Corporeal Soul is the source of Prana or Jiva.'}]
