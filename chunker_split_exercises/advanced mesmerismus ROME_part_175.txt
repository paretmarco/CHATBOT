It is a sort of CRISIS that the client see from the exterior. HISTORY: the first to develop this technique (the part with the two hands) has been the french psychologist Messinger. Exercise of the hypno-drama 1 - Have the person thinking to a problem 2 - induce the person with non verbal ways 3 - put him on the floor 4 - continue with the hypnodrama 5 - when catalepsy ends he can open his eyes How do you feel? 6 - use a light to enhance even more the enlarged awareness state the client has ========================================= FOCALIZING THE CLIENT on the problem We must focalize the client on his problem if we want to get results. It can be done with a former dialogue ========================================= Why we finish with the hypnodrama? Because our goal is bringing the person to the center. With the hypnodrama we bring the two halves together ========================================== The imbalances reveal in fact us something that is not equally weighted in both sides They can correspond to an excessivity SYMBOLISM True and false symbolism Exactly as in society, sometimes some symbols can be identified just with one side of the individuals, while in reality are of the whole person. When they are identified with just one side they become charged psychologically. True symbolism: Archetypes derivated (or false) symbolism: archetypes charged with psychological significance Example 1: the cross: symbolism Archetype: 2 dimensions that cross themselves, the human being Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : to suffer , it is as the symbolism is owned by just a part of the human being Example 2: The mother Archetype: the earth Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : what is conceived about own human mother. In reality is not the archetype of the mother. It is a part of you that monopolizes the archetype. Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it) Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself ARCHETYPE (ex verticality) it exist into the Non verbal self False symbolism (excessive rigidity) We can increase ========================================== METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a "history" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ============================================ THE SWAYING TEST What is "the test"? The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is "the human pendulum". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved? 4 close the eyes 5 repeat 6 You can do on the four problems area Health Family Relationship Success You will discover where the person has most problems USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS You can use the test to do "silent questions" Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy Do you think we can get results in these session? Is it something relating to your childhood? (if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways) ============================== END OF THE SECOND DAY ============================== USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions ================================ INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS We will introduce: sounds Breathing The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky) 1 - come to a person using sound 2 - use magnetism and catalepsy 3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I 4 - Lay the person down using the sound 5 - add passes 6 - wake up the person EXERCISE ============================================ THIRD DAY FLUIDIFICATION BALANCING HPA AXIS BALANCING HEMYSPHERES THREE COLOURS ( I A O ) These are for preparing the client After these are some ideas of working FLUIDIFICATION WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT Introduction to magnetism DEMO SKIN PROBLEMS and explanation of FLUIDIFICATION and POSITIVE FASCINATION Demonstration Exercise Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state. A very simple way is the "fluidification". FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions MAGNRETC MAPS Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS: Rage, Presentation on a theory on the work of magnetism. A research done by a finnish University shows the different zone of activation in the body FOUR TYPES Presentation of four types Choleric Lymphatic Sanguine Menlancholic ========================================================= EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active. Se we have a first big split HYPER HYPO Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER? Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism Many times we observe that HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic) LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic) SANGUINE (ambo-tonic) MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic) Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it. NOTE: The ancient connected the four types of personality to the four elements. Choleric FIRE. Very active. Hyperexcitation. Phlegmatic WATER. Submissive, Passive. He can do a lot of attention to his inner sensations. Sanguine AIR. Very sensitive and capable odf reacting. Melancholic EARTH. Material is his sensations, less emotions. More specific thinking. BURN-OUT How to deal with BURN OUT. We can think that many times burn-out happens in life after excess activity We will do a TWO STEPS THERAPY: First: give energy to the person and make her active Second: find (may be with regression) the reason why s/he was so active. Sometimes we can have IDENTIFICATIONS (I feel worthless, I feel powerless etc... behind the extreme work of the person. In a next day we will see how to de-identify) ======================== HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method) MAGNETIC POINTS When we heal we work 1 - both on general systems 2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point" Two types of opposite point. OR passing through the person OR to the opposite side ============================================================= MOVING THERAPY ============================================================= INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT LEVELS of MOVING THERAPY Level 1 - the Trabona Method USE: to balance the person HISTORY: Trabona is a student of dr. Paret that created this method that is very effective METHOD: you will tell to the client that "everyone has a pendulum inside himself". Or "everyone has his own rhytm". Begin creating movement in your client. Add magnetic passes (you will discover he will have a higher sensitivity) For level two, that is a sort of a self-hypnosis, we will search for a desire we want to work on: 1st we create the oculomotor blockage (optional) 2nd thinking to something we desire we see, going through three different desires, which one blocks you more the eyes Level 2 - Modified Akstein Method with non verbal hypnosis USE: For doing a self-hypnosis on yourself HISTORY: Akstein was a researcher that created Terpsichore Trance Therapy. He highly valued the work of Mesmer and he feels what he did was on his line He used music to create release state We agree with many of his tenets, but we prefer to use non verbal hypnotism as it is more corresponding to what we do Procedure: Begin with Trabona method a little to create a state of disposition Have the person look at a light and thinking what s/he desires. begin the movement (when looking at a light only back and forth, otherwise the trace will be not so good) and at a certain point ask her to breath from the nose and exhale from the mouth After have the person close the eyes - begin as in Trabona method Continue with non-verbal stimulations This method will create as a crisis but with a different way of doing. It is very good for self-hypnosis. We can create a movement similar to the crisis even without the negative emotion that normally we use to go in regression create catalepsy and after solve it ============================================== Introducing strong Somnambulism What is the key for deep somnambulism? It is very easy. We will before create ecstasy and after we will do a "non verbal induction" Ecstasy + Non Verbal It is easy that people doing such exercises has strong reaction SIDE RESULTS: Sometimes people goes into some sort of parallele reality (past lifes) In these case work as usual. The advantage of a past life is that the person can see how his life will evolve and the final consequences. We can see the past life also as a "metaphor" of his actual life. And working on the past life we can solve problems in the actual life ============================================= Doing outside exercises about presence (stop etc...) NOTE: presence outside is much more stronger ============================================= DAY 4 Explanation of earthly type and airy type The four meditations Water Including this exercise: In the ROOM Mirror exercise 2 people one will look himself in the mirror and the second will be an assistant at the begin we work normally, looking at the center after we begin inhaling and exaling clenching the fists and we look the right eye and after the left one We can give ourself a command: interlochl your finger and tell yourself blocked hands After assume presence position with interlocked fingers charges with open eyes (3 times) And DEVELOPING THE FORCE Earth Fire Air ============================================= Presentation of the muscolar preferences Earth - In the now Air - Projected in the future Water - we observe gaze and positions of the hands Fire - Focusing - we see very well when a person indicate somebody Question: In NLP we have three types Visual (similar to focusing) Kynesthesic (similar to watery) What about Auditory types? Answer: in general introverts are auditory. In psychology an introvert is somebody speaking with himself We can recognise auditory from : 1 - they speak with the left ear 2 - they are closed (arms / legs) 3 - we can recognise them on the spot because they have a lot of MICROMOVEMENTS ================================================ What we have seen were MUSCULAR PREFERENCES Now we will see how magnetic passes can change muscular preferences Exercise Check axially where a person is stronger Do passes from the weaker side. The person will become stronger Check speed in answer to fast movement toward the cheek (boxing position - but with the head turned in order to use only one eye) ================================================== DEMO OF WEIGHT LOSS TECHNIQUE ================================================== Afternoon ================================================== DEMONSTRATION OF MAGNETISM FOR WEIGHT LOSS ================================================== SELF HYPNOSIS WITH WATER Attentive explanation. The concept of INCORPORATION Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus) Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball Drink the water EXERCISE OF WEIGHT LOSS USES: inside a protocol for losing weight ELEMENTS: we eat both for nervous/psychological reason than for metabolic reason. We must work on both. It is Preceded by exercise of the water and WORKING ON THE THREE SYSTEM: Endocrine Nervous Psychological And after Solar Plexus and Front Wrists PROCEDURE First do a small hypnosis oculomotor blockage in case - you see how you want to be - you see a mirror you enter inside the mirror - you feel the sensation Now you begin to breath with TAURUS system If you have somebody helping you he will move your head. Otherwise you will do it Now if you have another person he will tell you that you are very capable And that in afew seconds you will open the eyes and see in the water as in a chrystal ball what you want to achieve Eyes open - drink the water Passes accompanying the water entering And now magnetic passes for weight loss ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Epiphysis and thyroid (send energy) Epyphysis and Pancreas Epyphysis and genitals NERVOUS SYSTEM Passes Calming passes with hand behind in a lower position Do them at third eye shoukders heart belly PSYCHOLOGY Do the principal organs as stomach liver splees intestines Touch now solar plexus and forehead WRISTS (touching the wrists as you are sending energy) In Chinese Medicine is said that all meridians can be found at the wrists But this concept exists also in the western medicine Repeat three times and after wake up the person REMEMBER Magnetism must be treated as sacred It is Better to do it in silence We must be in the NOW We can use verbal suggestions but only at the begin. Try to be SILENT In this way we will create a deep trance The mind will diffuse itself in the body. HOW TO LEARN IT - EXERCISE It is possible to doo in circles sometimes To learn better be in circle with the master demostrating After students can learn by themselves MAGNETISM In some way with the former technique we worked with the body. GENERAL PRINCIPLE: Passes when done near an organ will harmonize or stimulate it It is as we "speak directly with the body" ========================================================= Can this exercise be done even for different goals? Yes, this exercise can be done even for different goals You can put whatever you want inside the glass of water (as suggestion) ========================================================= DOING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE GLASS OF WATER ALONE BY YOURSELF Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus) Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball Drink the water Do passes on yourselves and after - block your ears and let yourself going deeply - If you are in the evening you can go to sleep - an other method will be presented and will be with movement and will be done the fifth day ========================================================== FAST RELEASE TECHNIQUE DEMO of crossed breathing followed by Hypno-Drama Afternoon Release technique based on crisis and called crossed breathing NAME OF THE TECHNIQUE: Technique of the crossed breathing EFFECTS: Strong crisis, fast effects USE: alternative to classic crisis technique, when you work a second time with somebody etc... NOTE: the technique of the crossed breathing, when done with the legs, can have a use for SEXUAL problems PHYSIOLOGICAL REASONS WHY THE PERSON GET HEALED: Polyvagal theory could be behind the reasons for the good results of such a technique Have the person think to a problem In case we can increase it What problems give (gave) to your life? How would your life be without it? Woould you like to become free? HOW TO DO IT: Create before a state of fascination Tel to the client Follow me Inhale and close your arms Exhale and open your ams This technique create a confusion in the mind as we breath in and out in a way very different from what we would do normally With words and non verbal communication we invite to be free After we can continue on the floor on the floor the legs of the subject wil be put in position And he will have reaction on the floor This technique is also good for self crisis. You can do it by yourself and ============================================= We can do the Campanelli Method at the end to balance Tell the client Tell the client to close his eyes and keep the mind free 1 - touching occiput and forehead 2 - warm blow 3 - turning the head 4 - touching head and sternum together 5 - movement on the arms 6 - again head and sternum 7 - again movement on the arms 8 - keep a moment a hand on the front and the other one over the belly (without touching) 9 - end of exercise =============================================== TECHNIQUE FOR STOP SMOKING CAMPANELLI Look to the slide =============================================== DI PISA Di Pisa used a method putting a person "against" the smoking habit Look the person into the eyes and speak of the problem of smoke (first fascination) Lower his body (he will feel a bad taste at the throat) Put him up - touch the solar plexus Make him hypersemnsitive to smell You will tell him that in a moment we will lighten a sigarette first time he smokes it will taste as nothing second time will taste as Hay third time he will cough Continue keeping the ligthned sigarette under his nose so smoke will enter You can repeat with a second sigarette Finish with direct suggestion looking him into the eyes ============================================= TECHNIQUE FOR ALLERGY Allergy and Food intolerance are very similar. They are as a "PHOBIA" of the immune system We can treat allergy with the technique of the LIGHT and the ball behind the occiput. The ideal is to know the FIRST TIME a person got allergy We can after do a technique where we will have our client find something similar to the allergene but with no effect We will have imagine to eat progressively less of the product of no effect and more of the allergene. Percentage will change 90% 80% etc... Progressively you will create change ================================================= Gypsy self hypnosis what it is ANSWERS =============================================== Exercise at the mirror putting away false identifications USE: this is an advanced exercise. Its goal is putting away the false personalities that are parasiting ourself. METHOD: to do that we will A get with a mirror to a state of high PRESENCE at ourself At this pooint we will see the image in the mirror and understand that the I we are seeing in the mirror has a false idea about himself This exercise is divided in various steps 1 - look at yourself in the mirror 2 - create the first reactions 3 - WORK ON BOTH HEMYSPHERES begin breathing and at the same time clench fists looking before right eye and after left eye 4 - CREATE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTION AND DISCHARGE inhale fully, your breats must be full begin moving arms as putting away tension exale fully until your lungs will be empty REPEAT 2 or 3 times 5 - Now look the YOU in the mirror Think - this person think to be (ex. imperfect) You observe but you see that in reality a just an idea this person in the mirror has Ask: what does this person more want in the universe? The answer will come in form of a sensation And in this moment you will feel FREE You can work on different identifications - being imperfect - being inadequate - being incomplete ============================================ Fifth day We will delve a moment in Hermeticism and Quantum Physics SYMBOLS The first symbol is the circle, in some way it is the whole, the DAO It divides itself in sun and moon because we live in an EXPLICATE order This division will create soon and moon, the two opposites, because the word is done of opposites The circle with a line is the symbol of the salt and it is the symbol of the body QUANTUM PHYSICS Why we speak of an implicate order behind the explicate? Implicate and explicate exemples the double slit experiment example of the light exemple of elections We can speak of quantum systems Even our mind is a quantum system Your body is an implicate order We will see now an exercise to understand it Quantum exercise to put away an emotion We continue exploring ourself Notice now the space between thoughts Explicate and implicate again? Who is behind your thoughts? Now we come back to the symbols and we see the symbols of the elements, one arrow up fire arrow down water etc... Lets become conscious of the elements We can develop conscioussnes of the 4 elements in the body The 4 elements can be also kynestetical ways to experiment reality Exercise of awareness between breathing. Do attention on the space between each breath What is between each breath? There is YOU Hermeticism and quantum physics are linked. There is a relationship between hermeticism, magnetism and quantum physics Schopenauer is in fact the key because he highly influenced the group of scientists that was at the basis of the "quantum paradygm" exercise =========================================================== TRUE AND DERIVATIVE SYMBOLISM The symbols as the vertical, the circle, are primitive and archetipal symbols Jung had called them "archetypes" But there is a "derivate somnambulism" that is based on the original symbol that can take MEANINGS from experiences an example is the symbol of the cross. It is an archetype, but in the christian Religion it takes further meaning Another exemple are the symbol of the MOTHER and the FATHER They are archetypes, but they get psychologically coloured. We have the true symbol, but education can "CHARGE" in some way the symbol. Even our hands can express symbolism. Pointing hand - directive and indicative Open hand - receiving and harmonizing Small distant touch - in some way we stay "detached" Archetyply, the Pointing hand many types is related to the father/male figure, the receiveing hand to the mother/female figure The psychology of our relationships with these figures will give "colour" to the original archetypical symbolism (Benemeglio). It means the person will search or refuse some kind of touches Furter traumatism can lead the person in not wanting any touch. We must always work experimentally. We have three styles of hypnotherapy and touch Directive Mother Detached These three types are also in Virginia Satir that observed the existence of three types. But they are also very ancient and you can find (at least in the definition of the first two) in every tradition We will do now a demo of an induction with specific touches PROCEDURE Go near a person. TEST where she/he reacts best Use the same type of stimulation NOTE: it is important to understand that it is not only your touch, but your WHOLE BEHAVIOUR that will create reaction in your client When you have a new client discover which approach is the best one. When a person will be in deep hypnosis in reality s/he will reacts to very symbol in a balanced way But for arrivig to this level there is a path. First: a subject will have PREFERENCES and we must understand them Second. in the course of interactions these preferences can change USE : to adapt to the person. To use the type of touch/approach that most suits his/her personality AFTERNOON The mirror exercise of de-identification is very important to understand that we tend to enter in some identifications and mantain them always We must learn how to put away our identifications Otherwise in our life we will repeat always the same pattern. Reference to the mirror exercise of yesterday to put away identification The Enneagram can be that The idea of the enneagram starts from 9 types of personality It can be even be read in the opposite way. What is that causes this 9 types of personalities? We can look at our different self identifications: may be we have FEAR - of being imperfect - of being inadequate - of being incomplete ... ... Explanation of what is the enneagram.
