The reasoning is unconscious, however, different from the traditional way: at this point it is necessary to use a quantum paradigm to treat this type of information that appears on a conscious level exclusively expressed by symbols or feelings. Quantum mechanics is a modern discipline and effective to create models and predictions controllable quantum behavior. Can you give us helpful hints on how long elaboration on what to do in case of need, etc.. The quantum process allows us to understand what is behind the genius. The brilliant idea sometimes comes in milliseconds. Our individualistic self, consisting as it does of habits, is seldom capable of fully understanding the infinite range of answers which life might provide. It is therefore necessary to open up one's vision and have recourse to intuition, to a higher sense in which is not merely grounded on logic, but is rather based on an array of different evaluations which can only be made unconsciously.

Magnetism and Quantum thinking can be a road to success. If you were to enquire from many people as to how they have attained success, they would reply to you that “they had been blessed with luck”, and that life’s circumstances had enabled them to give expression to their own inspiration. In actual fact, these persons set out from an inward impulse, from some force which is created out of their subjective interaction with the Universe. Ultimately, the Universe is what they actually give effect to. It is this force, this energy, which confers stability even on their life plan, and which enables them to persevere amid difficulties and through them. Resort to this kind of force is normally escorted by a feeling of satisfaction, and by a resolute desire to enjoy life with regard to every thing it has to offer. Success and happiness are always in front of us. All we need is learning how to stir into motion our vital energy, and how to steer it in the right direction, in order to enable it to yield positive results. The Universe is no more than a response structure. It is commensurately with the way in which we interact with the Universe that whatever we wrest from it emerges into existence. We are able therefore to extract results, provided we adopt the right posture. Creating and Steering energy. The vital energy represents the second element in the under-stated fundamental dyad, which represents the essential key to achieve any thing: The Fundamental dyad 1 – Consciousness of what we do in the now and over time 2 –Vital Energy The vital energy, which is the foundation that underpins true personal magnetism, is chiefly physical in nature. It consists in vitality. Usually, however, we are devoid of true consciousness of it. When that is the case, which is the normal scenario, vital energy is merely used and consumed away in the effort of preserving our habits. Many people’s reactions are piloted by a tiny little ego which is capricious and wasteful in setting out to attain its objectives. Such objectives accordingly fritter away this vital energy in the undertaking of aimless actions. A parallel exists between what we do with mental energy and what we do with the gifts and possibilities life offers us, such as relationships and our money. Avoiding dispersions of mental energy and channelling it in the right direction represent human engagements which need to be carried out in order to increase energy, and thereby expand the range of our active doing. If we concentrate, the greater amplitude of mental power which is generated by concentration has the effect of us developing power in reality and naturally transcending habits. When that stage is reached, we will then be capable of enjoying the opportunities life supplies us with. The aim of a coach is to develop the skills and potential of the coachee.

DURATION Two days of workshops Practical instructions on how to use the secret energy of the mind and fascination in order to attain success –Practical applications aimed at improving one’s personal charm, life, profession, relationships, and financial activities First day: - Coaching techniques - Business and Leadership - Techniques of Hypnoselling - Enneagram applied to business - The system LuxMind ® - Quantum Psi ® - Natural coach Second day: - Effective coaching - Psychological concepts to the business and marketing - Coaching for sale - Mental Skills - Hypnotic communication for business - Coach Manager Hypno-Selling and Gaze for everyday uses - Charisma enhancement In this age of ours, man, lost in a frantic quest for material objects and opportunities, turns oblivious to the fact that the true key to power is found inside his own self. The role played by the expression “Personal Magnetism” in ordinary parlance is to designate that kind of powerful fascination which some individuals exercise over fellow human beings. Without seemingly doing anything special, in fact, this class of individuals arouse sympathy, interest and consideration. Their presence is welcomed, and one almost feels impelled to win over their friendship and earn their good esteem. Personal influence is an inherent property of man’s indigenous nature. The eye represents one of the essential elements of such connatural human property. If, upon surveying the history of past epochs, we were to search for the reasons behind the success achieved by famous men from every age or nation, we would quickly reach the realization that this success always resulted from their ability to magnetically "fascinate" their addressees. The mere action of looking at someone, without anything further, is charged with meaning. It surely conveys a meaning of interest in such person. In truth, we look more often at the people who interest us or who are to our liking than at the others. Provided the eye is appositely trained, its power will be amplified. Although each person has in himself the peculiar psychological and mental elements which enable him to impact on his fellow human beings, not every one makes use of such elements to the same degree. We use the term "persuasive fascination" to denote the practical application of fascination within the context of daily communication. The most glaring and typical manifestation of “personal power" consists in the art of persuading 1. The person who holds the keys to that art is readily believed in respect of whatever he says, and evinces a form of hegemony over his fellow human beings. In this course we will deal with how to use gaze and non verbal communication to enhance your effectiveness and Charisma. We will also work with the “hypno-selling” system, a method based on words and other elements as NLP-3 aimed at giving you more capacity of persuading other people. DURATION (2 days) The spirit of selling Working for helping the client solving a problem How to use effectively your non verbal communication Enneagram and NLP-3 for selling Basic of hypno-selling Non verbal commands Magnetism and relationships Real Hypno-Mentalism and Hypno-Magnetism – silent commands and mental control Real Original Hypno-mentalism: the capability to use trance states to alter the reality a person perceive and have her react in an unconscious way. We use only non verbal communication, few words and obviously the mind. Ancient magnetists realized some very spectacular feats: “The next experiment was equally successful. The other girl, whom Mr. A. de Constant had also under his influence, was placed while in a waking state with her back to the wall. Mr. de Constant then took me aside, and asked me which part of the subject he should paralyze by his silent will? I wrote down, “La jambe gauche.” He then, standing about two yards from the girl, made an effort of will, after which he told the girl to move about: upon which she moved every limb except her left leg, which had become perfectly rigid. In the same way the girl’s right leg, and then one of her arms, were paralyzed. But the most curious thing was when I desired that the girl’s head might become motionless. It was literally stuck to the wall by the silent will of the Mesmeriser. Her arms, her legs could move, but not her head; so that she could only walk forward as far as the attachment by her head would permit. On forcibly separating her head from the wall, it went back with a stiffness which seemed to me inimitable by voluntary muscular action.” In our courses we explain these feats. In the future we will even activate a complete course of study in these phenomena. Actually some of these teaching are in the course “train the trainers” It is a discipline that creates effects that are impressive many times not only for the subject but even for the experimenter. In real hypno-mentalism we can have contact mind reading, telepathic effects based on the “psychic atmosphere” we create with the subject, reading people based on physiognomy and other elements, and having the subject reaching hypnotically to the non verbal orders of the operator. The subject has always the eyes open and no trance or post hypnotic suggestion is used. Uses in real life of these skills are in: better understanding people at deeper levels than the verbal one, communicating with the unconscious mind, having reaction to non verbal symbols and intentions. Hypno-magnetism: enhancing magnetic effects with hypnotic elements. Sometimes we can use hypno-magnetism for clairvoyance, or for healing people. Hypno-magnetism is based on mesmerism and is the basis for some strange effects that can even happen at a distance… It is like a subtle force in action that probably can be explained in quantistic terms, everything is interconnected in the universe, and in some way we touch this deeper level. In hypno-magnetism we can have distant influence, distant healing, magnetic healing enhanced by hypnotic techniques, clairvoyance etc.. Uses in real life of hypno-magnetism are in: intuition and creativity development, healing, etc… Real Hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism can be allied and combined. Hypnomagnetic responses can trigger hypnomentalistic reactions. Our goal is both to bring to the present world the knowledge of these powerful techniques in many case almost forgotten, both to empower the practitioner of real abilities and capabilities. About REAL hypno-mentalism: This is the real stuff… no add ons of other types should be used. It is true that there are some performers that say achieve hypno-mentalism effects, but sometimes they use psychological tricks instead of relying on pure intuition. In this blog we speak instead of the real stuff that has to do with developing our mind potential. Pure and real mental magic. Real Hypno-mentalism should be done without any help of the rational mind. It must be done in the more real and participative way and requires an adequate ambiance, and the effects will be striking! In fact if you use psychological tricks you activate your cortical responses and reduce your deeper concentration and will rely on your rationality. Here we delve instead deep inside our mind and we use these exercises as a training for intuition and sensitivity. The performer should always start from the idea that he will get the effect exactly as previewed. Mind and non verbal communication will create the necessary atmosphere. We can ally to the aforementioned disciplines the capability of reading the physiognomy and the non verbal communication of a person, in order to better “enter” in him/her Hermetic Magnetism – Accessing The secret energy of the mind This course will bring us into the deeper meaning of magnetism The cages from which it is harder to get out are invisible. They are our fears, insecurities, prejudices. But the keys to the inner freedom are already in our hands, we just need to learn how to use them. Do you want to broaden your horizons? Gain a new awareness of the reality that surrounds us? Make concrete and clear actions for developing the real you during your lifetime? This course not only shows us that it is possible, but, through many exercises and symbols for a fitness of body and mind, also shows us the path to follow to fully realize all our physical and intellectual potential . It teaches us to relax the muscles and internal organs, to revitalize the breath, to dominate the negative thoughts and compulsions that are detrimental to our health, to detoxify the mind of fixations, to increase our creative power . The magnetic force that sleeps within us can and must be awakened from its daily trance, which prevents us to gain the happiness and success, but first you need to retrieve an authentic perception of time, rediscover the energy potential of our sexuality lived in all its fullness, shake off the stiffness and tension blockers result of bad habits that finally we will be able to eradicate.
