Personal influence is an inherent property of man’s indigenous nature. The eye represents one of the essential elements of such connatural human property. If, upon surveying the history of past epochs, we were to search for the reasons behind the success achieved by famous men from every age or nation, we would quickly reach the realization that this success always resulted from their ability to magnetically "fascinate" their addressees. The mere action of looking at someone, without anything further, is charged with meaning. It surely conveys a meaning of interest in such person. In truth, we look more often at the people who interest us or who are to our liking than at the others. Provided the eye is appositely trained, its power will be amplified. Although each person has in himself the peculiar psychological and mental elements which enable him to impact on his fellow human beings, not every one makes use of such elements to the same degree. We use the term "persuasive fascination" to denote the practical application of fascination within the context of daily communication. The most glaring and typical manifestation of “personal power" consists in the art of persuading 1. The person who holds the keys to that art is readily believed in respect of whatever he says, and evinces a form of hegemony over his fellow human beings. In this course we will deal with how to use gaze and non verbal communication to enhance your effectiveness and Charisma. We will also work with the “hypno-selling” system, a method based on words and other elements as NLP-3 aimed at giving you more capacity of persuading other people. DURATION (2 days) The spirit of selling Working for helping the client solving a problem How to use effectively your non verbal communication Enneagram and NLP-3 for selling Basic of hypno-selling Non verbal commands Magnetism and relationships Real Hypno-Mentalism and Hypno-Magnetism – silent commands and mental control Real Original Hypno-mentalism: the capability to use trance states to alter the reality a person perceive and have her react in an unconscious way. We use only non verbal communication, few words and obviously the mind. Ancient magnetists realized some very spectacular feats: “The next experiment was equally successful. The other girl, whom Mr. A. de Constant had also under his influence, was placed while in a waking state with her back to the wall. Mr. de Constant then took me aside, and asked me which part of the subject he should paralyze by his silent will? I wrote down, “La jambe gauche.” He then, standing about two yards from the girl, made an effort of will, after which he told the girl to move about: upon which she moved every limb except her left leg, which had become perfectly rigid. In the same way the girl’s right leg, and then one of her arms, were paralyzed. But the most curious thing was when I desired that the girl’s head might become motionless. It was literally stuck to the wall by the silent will of the Mesmeriser. Her arms, her legs could move, but not her head; so that she could only walk forward as far as the attachment by her head would permit. On forcibly separating her head from the wall, it went back with a stiffness which seemed to me inimitable by voluntary muscular action.” In our courses we explain these feats. In the future we will even activate a complete course of study in these phenomena. Actually some of these teaching are in the course “train the trainers” It is a discipline that creates effects that are impressive many times not only for the subject but even for the experimenter. In real hypno-mentalism we can have contact mind reading, telepathic effects based on the “psychic atmosphere” we create with the subject, reading people based on physiognomy and other elements, and having the subject reaching hypnotically to the non verbal orders of the operator. The subject has always the eyes open and no trance or post hypnotic suggestion is used. Uses in real life of these skills are in: better understanding people at deeper levels than the verbal one, communicating with the unconscious mind, having reaction to non verbal symbols and intentions. Hypno-magnetism: enhancing magnetic effects with hypnotic elements. Sometimes we can use hypno-magnetism for clairvoyance, or for healing people. Hypno-magnetism is based on mesmerism and is the basis for some strange effects that can even happen at a distance… It is like a subtle force in action that probably can be explained in quantistic terms, everything is interconnected in the universe, and in some way we touch this deeper level. In hypno-magnetism we can have distant influence, distant healing, magnetic healing enhanced by hypnotic techniques, clairvoyance etc.. Uses in real life of hypno-magnetism are in: intuition and creativity development, healing, etc… Real Hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism can be allied and combined. Hypnomagnetic responses can trigger hypnomentalistic reactions. Our goal is both to bring to the present world the knowledge of these powerful techniques in many case almost forgotten, both to empower the practitioner of real abilities and capabilities. About REAL hypno-mentalism: This is the real stuff… no add ons of other types should be used. It is true that there are some performers that say achieve hypno-mentalism effects, but sometimes they use psychological tricks instead of relying on pure intuition. In this blog we speak instead of the real stuff that has to do with developing our mind potential. Pure and real mental magic. Real Hypno-mentalism should be done without any help of the rational mind. It must be done in the more real and participative way and requires an adequate ambiance, and the effects will be striking! In fact if you use psychological tricks you activate your cortical responses and reduce your deeper concentration and will rely on your rationality. Here we delve instead deep inside our mind and we use these exercises as a training for intuition and sensitivity. The performer should always start from the idea that he will get the effect exactly as previewed. Mind and non verbal communication will create the necessary atmosphere. We can ally to the aforementioned disciplines the capability of reading the physiognomy and the non verbal communication of a person, in order to better “enter” in him/her Hermetic Magnetism – Accessing The secret energy of the mind This course will bring us into the deeper meaning of magnetism The cages from which it is harder to get out are invisible. They are our fears, insecurities, prejudices. But the keys to the inner freedom are already in our hands, we just need to learn how to use them. Do you want to broaden your horizons? Gain a new awareness of the reality that surrounds us? Make concrete and clear actions for developing the real you during your lifetime? This course not only shows us that it is possible, but, through many exercises and symbols for a fitness of body and mind, also shows us the path to follow to fully realize all our physical and intellectual potential . It teaches us to relax the muscles and internal organs, to revitalize the breath, to dominate the negative thoughts and compulsions that are detrimental to our health, to detoxify the mind of fixations, to increase our creative power . The magnetic force that sleeps within us can and must be awakened from its daily trance, which prevents us to gain the happiness and success, but first you need to retrieve an authentic perception of time, rediscover the energy potential of our sexuality lived in all its fullness, shake off the stiffness and tension blockers result of bad habits that finally we will be able to eradicate.

He was also initiated in various groups that continued the old tradition Mesmerismus © and Campanelli’s system: our lineage connects directly to Campanelli for the stop smoking system. Dr Paret was the person that personally brought to the world the Campanellli’s method for stopping smoking in 55 seconds. Campanelli’s fame, punctuated by astounding results and corroborated by unimpeachable testimonies, appears to be truly unassailable. His is an unbelievable, amazing, unparalleled case, which has been studied by worldwide famous scientific celebrities, who have analyzed the phenomenon of his person and sealed their reports by stating the following: <<The relevant facts are true, and yet they are devoid of any plausible explanations in terms of ordinary therapeutic techniques>>2. Formerly an advocate practicing from his study in central Rome and an inveterate smoker, Campanelli, following a meeting with Hermann Michel, was so impressed by the fact he had succeeded in quitting smoking that he wanted to learn Michel’s magnetic and hypnotic techniques. He eventually became, in his own right, a healer specialized in removing the bad habit of smoking from fellow humans. The roster of his patients, both Italians and foreigners, include the following: The winner of the Nobel Prize for peace Shimon Peres, King Hussein of Jordan, Margareth von Trotta, Maurizio Costanzo, Mariangela Melato, Bruno Zevi, Margherita Boniver, and Maurizio Ferrara. Fascination and Hypno-Magnetism: dr Paret is a disciple of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa. Prof. Erminio di Pisa was a person marked by exceptional charm and energy. He specialized in instant hypnosis and in instant healing especially. He was also a medium (= a psychic). Though he lived and worked in Milan, he travelled abroad as well. He was for instance in South Korea following an invitation. Therein, he carried out experiments which drew a large crowd of people interested in them. He chaired the Astrological Association of the Light since 1973, and acted as director of the Centre of Instant Hypnosis. At the age of 14, he fully devoted himself to the study of hypnotic techniques. He has hypnotized more than 250.000 persons. For several years, both the Italian state-owned radio and television have shown us his parapsychic exploits: Collective hypnosis of a theatre audience, distance paranormal healing, announcing the final result of the “Corsa Tris”, a horseracing event, fifteen minutes before it even started, and so on. Mesmer. The method elaborated by F. A. Mesmer allows healing to take place quite rapidly, especially when a group is formed and symbols are utilized. Many techniques come from the lineage Mesmer ? Puysegur ?Du Potet ? Durville . Historically speaking, magnetism after Mesmer continued with Puysegur and his disciple Baron du Potet, whose pioneering efforts were then taken further by the Durville brothers. The Durville brothers founded a secret order and we continue directly some of their techniques. Fascination: our lineage comes from Virgilio T. and Donato. Virgilio, one of the persons who inspired us the most in the field of animal magnetism, is capable of instantly fascinating another person.
