As they don’t want earthly love, they become hyper-spiritual and desire harmony to avoid taking positions. They have a preference for fickle positions. Their representational channel is COENEASTHESIS AUDITORY. Key Motivation: SEEK HARMONY KEY RELATIONS WITH ENNEAGRAM TYPES TYPE 1 (REFORMER) I’m OK if I’m perfect or strive for perfection! You’re OK if you are perfect or strive for perfection! TYPE 2 (HELPER) Let me help. Acknowledge them. TYPE 3 (ACHIEVER) Think positive! I’m OK if I think positive. You’re OK if you think positive. TYPE 4 (INDIVIDUALIST) I’m suffering therefore I exist! I’m OK if I’m suffering emotionally. You’re OK if you are suffering emotionally. TYPE 5 (INVESTIGATOR) I’m OK if I have information. You’re OK if you don’t invade me. TYPE 6 (LOYALIST) Recognize their abilities. Look for their good points. They aren’t bad but attack out of fear. TIPO 7 (ENTHUSIAST) Fill me up!!!!! I want to live positive emotional states! Give me new possibilities. Fear remaining stuck. TYPE 8 (CHALLENGER) Give them a responsibility. TYPE 9 (PEACEMAKER) Let me take part!!!!!!!!!!!!! As well as being able to recognize ourselves in one of the nine different enneagram types, the enneagram can also be used as a communication tool. ENNEAGRAM FOR COMMUNICATING The first thing we should do is OBSERVE our interlocutor in all of his/ her behaviors to be able to identify the enneagram type s/he belongs to. This allows us to understand the reasons behind his/ her behavior and eventual difficulties that we may meet, allowing us to pull out his/ her values. Thus, we can enter into a rapport without risk of doing or saying anything that makes us go on a “collision course”. It is, therefore, evident that the enneagram can be used both on personal and professional levels. ENNEAGRAM: A PROFESSIONAL & PERSONAL TOOL On a personal level it gives us the possibility of extending self-knowledge and favoring the development of a balanced personality. It helps us to communicate better with the people that are important in our lives, in work, in relationships… etc. On a professional level, the enneagram is useful to therapists, consultants and also to those in a business field, like managers, because it completes knowledge, allowing you to understand the people with whom you have a relationship in a quicker and deeper way and to react while keeping in mind what is most important. For example, if you are a business man and you use the enneagram correctly, you can understand more about the abilities of your team members, instilling in them a team spirit which is fundamental to achieve success. In all cases, the enneagram is more than a simple method to understand ourselves and others, it is open to the past and the future at the same time. That is why when we talk about the enneagram we can immediately associate it as a: TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING SELF; TOOL FOR PREDICTING; TOOL FOR DEVELOPMENT; and TOOL FOR COMMUNICATING. Even if we have divided psychological typology into nine categories, it is important to point out that we have all of them present in us, although we have a preference for certain types, or we use the type that we need at each situation. Psychiatric pathologies are psychological enneagram types taken to the extreme or can be at rest, hence, empty. For example, if a personality is dominated by the compulsions of the type to which it belongs, we refer to “false personality” or “destructive self”. The enneagram is a new answer to the research of understanding ourselves and others, communication, and relationships between human beings. “He that has made a door and a lock has also made a key” (Chabreuil) Hypnosis in NLP is a developed ability to communicate which allows us to establish excellent relations with others, and grow towards autonomy, freedom and the appreciation of life in all of its glory. We can control our brain together with its functioning in its relationship with ourselves and we can make it carry out the instructions we give it. For example, if we speak angrily, the brain selects anger and arranges an adequate state of mind to the thoughts activated. On the other hand, if we express ourselves with enthusiasm, the brain will process this type of response and produces a happy state of mind. “Our brain is a learning machine and we are its programmers!!!!! !” Passing from one state of mind to another is an automatic ability. This is demonstrable when we watch two lovers together: both of them depend on smiles and words of love in order to feel being in hell or heaven. In the mysterious world of emotions, that many of us refuse, escape from or do not understand, there are deep mechanisms by which people lose responsibility for their actions that are automatic, so that they suffer or enjoy the results of their behaviour without realizing, until they get to the point where, if they are suffering, they attach the blame to somebody else according to their own strategies. Hypnosis is, therefore, a natural state that Man finds himself involved with in the act of living; s/he is able to bring it on or induce it in others, or s/he may experience it without knowing that it is called hypnosis. All kinds of efficient communication are hypnosis. It is a road that takes us to our mind, a fast path, sometimes rapid and sometimes steep. Hypnosis is the deep communication that you establish between two individuals. A hypnotist is a type of pilot who is able to alter a collision course in any of his passengers’ needs. The hypnotized individual is someone who allows himself to be hypnotized. In this state of consent, the left hemisphere becomes “surrounded” and in such a case, suggestions can be uncritically accepted by the subject and, consequently, translated into concrete actions. In a state of hypnosis, the subject’s will is not eliminated, it is as if the subject concedes a privileged audience to the hypnotist, lending him/ her maximum attention to what is being proposed, totally conserving his freedom to do or not do whatever is being suggested to him/ her. It is in fact false, as well as never being scientifically proven, that through hypnosis you can make someone commit acts against their will. Even if the hypnotist tries, the subject will not carry out the order given or might even decide to come out of the hypnotic trance, refusing to continue. Hypnotism, even if triggered by another person, is essentially “autogenous” in the sense that it uses an absolutely natural functioning process of our psyche. It may seem ridiculous to think that- if up until now we were convinced that life was a succession of happenings- that we need to prepare ourselves to live. Now we can see things from another prospective and say that: Life changes at the moment in which we change and we can consider ourselves as protagonists of our life without having to content ourselves with the walk-on parts or be forced to live by life. Perhaps arriving at the foot of the page and writing the words “The End” makes us realize that what we see behind us is not our story, what we would have wanted, and regret not having obtained what it was that we wanted because we have been the obstacle. “Life is something that happens to us while we are busy doing other things”. (Anthony De Mello) “Whatever you want to do, or dream of, start it, audacity has talent, power and magic” (Goethe) EXAMPLES OF HYPNOTIC MODELS AND METHODS – INTRODUCTION TO HYPNOTIC COMMUNICATION Negative orders One of the simplest hypnotic communication models is “negative orders” For example: If I say to you, “don’t think about summer”, you will automatically be forced to think about it in order to understand my statement. Starting with a negation means that the listener does not sense any pressure to act. We often use this negative order model without knowing and we get an undesired reaction. For example: Don’t worry.....Don’t be jealous.......Nothing bad is going to happen. Whoever is listening, in some way, has to interpret the undesired behaviour to be able to understand what has been said to him, and this increases the possibility of this same behaviour happening. Without knowing it, these people hypnotize the subject and end up having undesirable reactions. The same model may be used to get more useful reactions from people, which are found in a trance-like state or not. For example: Don’t be curious to know what I feel about you! Hypnosis can be used both in personal or professional scopes, in fact, it is useful for sorting out problems or eliminating all limits that we program in ourselves. Hypnotism is, therefore, used to stop smoking, lose weight, heal fears, get rid off phobias… etc. Additionally, it may be used in a more creative way, to continually grow your abilities and your choices in life. It helps you to learn how to improve what you already do well. Hypnosis is a group of instruments that help us to improve the quality of our life and the relationship that we have with ourselves. The aim is to be able to create an internal situation in which the subject can access transformation processes. If you have a collection of mechanical tools, it doesn’t mean that you are capable of fixing a car! The use of a series of Hypnotic Communication Models can pave the way to creating a: HYPNOTIC INDUCTION What I am about to illustrate is a simple hypnotic induction based on the Erickson model that you can carry out on another person to create a state of profound relaxation. HYPNOTIC INDUCTION BASED ON PACE AND LEADING Before starting, remember to physically pace the subject to establish a condition of trust or in other words rapport. Above all, imitate respiration. Speak while the subject is exhaling. Place yourself in front of him to be able to better observe his reactions. And now while you are sitting down, and you are in front of me, and you can listen to my words, and you can hear noises that come from outside, I don’t know if you realize....... (pause) that something inside of you is changing. And while something inside you is changing, you can feel the temperature of the room, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground, I don’t know if you realize that your breathing is becoming calmer, and with every breath you are relaxing even more And while you can relax, and while you can feel the sensation of your closed eyes, I ask myself if you realize you can cradle yourself in a feeling of relaxation. And you can imagine being even more relaxed, and while you can feel the weight of your body, you can imagine how to enter in to a peaceful cloud, and you can feel that some parts of your body are relaxed and others can be even more relaxed, and you can let yourself be cradled in this feeling, and let yourself slide deeper into a feeling of sleepiness, I don’t know if you realize you can be even calmer than you think you can be. You can feel the air that passes through your nostrils, you can feel the touch of your clothes against your skin, and go further, my voice will accompany you. At this point, the subject is in a light, “trance-like” state; we can continue with the stairway suggestion to make him go into a deeper state of relaxation. “THE STAIRWAY” And while you relax, you can imagine being at the top of a magnificent stairway, and while you are at the top of this stairway, I’ll count from ten down to one and with every number you can imagine going down towards the bottom. Ten, at the top of the stairs ready to go down into a deeper sleep for ever. Nine, another step takes you further down, as if in a cloud of peace, a sweet and relaxing cloud. Eight takes you even more towards the bottom, further down, in an ever deepening feeling, falling even more asleep. Seven, seven is your relaxing number; and every time you hear it you will relax even more. Six, another step, another step downwards, towards the bottom. Five, almost completely asleep, cradled in a feeling of deep peace Four, another relaxing step; when we get to the bottom of the staircase you will be completely asleep. Three, let yourself be cradled by your feelings, sinking even further. Two, a step away from being completely asleep, a more pleasing feeling forever. One, completely asleep, in a feeling of complete wellness. Zero, further down than the bottom, calm, asleep and at peace with yourself. Now... you feel emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually well. Now I’ll count from 3 to 1 and when you awake you will feel relaxed and well. 3 you feel well 2 you have a feeling of happiness.
