The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh. =============================================== We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY (with hypnodrama) This demo will be done in the following way 1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM 2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA" This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow. =============================================== END DAY 1 =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND DEMO: Just using small sounds and small touches a person is put on the floor We do it to show it as the sense of balance is fundamental The mental structure is connected to physical structure ================================================ Example of something similar in the art performance. In many modern art performances the performers try to create reactions in the spectators Even in theatre. Peaple sit down and reactions are created People must be well seated in order to receive the most stimulations ================================================ HOW TO TEST IF THE PERSONNIS ENTERING IN STATE? There are two basic ways of testing 1-checking the balance of a person 2-with the use of catalepsies For checking the balance we put a hand on the shoulder of the person or we do small touches. ================================================ DEMO and exercise Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles. When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides 1 - Put a person in the center in static position 2 - Approach her from different sides Right Left Front 3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition). A circle will feel him as you are "around" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up Don't touch to much the person in thsi first exercise. ================================================ Q&A Can I do with a lying person? Yes you can do, but you must be very expert. In reality when a person is standing each time we see his/her reaction in the balance and how he she holds it. When a person is laying we can only guess ================================================ NOTE Different types of people Some people will react more, some people less. Sometimes we must REDUCE stimulations and we will have stronger reactions Notice how these stimulations are something you cannot oppose to How can you oppose yourself to a sound? We see for exemple that music can work even on very rational people. ================================================= Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) ==================================================== There are two ways of doing non verbal hypnosis: Accompanying Symbolic We advise not to be completely symbolic as you risk to lose yourself in excessive thought and symbolism It is better to mix the two styles You will follow your client through some main axes ===================================================== MAIN AXES: Approaching (Attack) / Going Away (Abandon) Touching or arriving from the right side (father) / Touching or arriving from the left side mother Direct touch (male) / Soft touch (female) / no touch or just small touch (for people that doesnt like touch) The same you can have in sounds ===================================================== In combination with the former elements you can use "words without a meaning" These are words as DOS, DOOH, DEST that have no specific meaning and the mind will create imagination around these sounds ===================================================== INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also "proxemics" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements Use also the principles of the four steps therapy: - Concentration of the mind - Hypnosis - Solutions - Amplifying solutions GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING. Is the client that reacts CHANGE PARTNER ========================================= At the end you can add HYPNODRAMA As the person has catalepsy lift the two hands, put them in front You can suggest (if you want) with words that the right hand is the father side and the left the feminine side ================================================== HYPNODRAMA METHOD 1: Mixed with non verbal hypnosis USE: to open the mind and evocate emotional reactions. It is a sort of CRISIS that the client see from the exterior. HISTORY: the first to develop this technique (the part with the two hands) has been the french psychologist Messinger. Exercise of the hypno-drama 1 - Have the person thinking to a problem 2 - induce the person with non verbal ways 3 - put him on the floor 4 - continue with the hypnodrama 5 - when catalepsy ends he can open his eyes How do you feel? 6 - use a light to enhance even more the enlarged awareness state the client has ========================================= FOCALIZING THE CLIENT on the problem We must focalize the client on his problem if we want to get results. It can be done with a former dialogue ========================================= Why we finish with the hypnodrama? Because our goal is bringing the person to the center. With the hypnodrama we bring the two halves together ========================================== The imbalances reveal in fact us something that is not equally weighted in both sides They can correspond to an excessivity SYMBOLISM True and false symbolism Exactly as in society, sometimes some symbols can be identified just with one side of the individuals, while in reality are of the whole person. When they are identified with just one side they become charged psychologically. True symbolism: Archetypes derivated (or false) symbolism: archetypes charged with psychological significance Example 1: the cross: symbolism Archetype: 2 dimensions that cross themselves, the human being Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : to suffer , it is as the symbolism is owned by just a part of the human being Example 2: The mother Archetype: the earth Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : what is conceived about own human mother. In reality is not the archetype of the mother. It is a part of you that monopolizes the archetype. Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it) Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself ARCHETYPE (ex verticality) it exist into the Non verbal self False symbolism (excessive rigidity) We can increase ========================================== METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a "history" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ============================================ THE SWAYING TEST What is "the test"? The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is "the human pendulum". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved? 4 close the eyes 5 repeat 6 You can do on the four problems area Health Family Relationship Success You will discover where the person has most problems USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS You can use the test to do "silent questions" Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy Do you think we can get results in these session? Is it something relating to your childhood? (if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways) ============================== END OF THE SECOND DAY ============================== USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions ================================ INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS We will introduce: sounds Breathing The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky) 1 - come to a person using sound 2 - use magnetism and catalepsy 3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I 4 - Lay the person down using the sound 5 - add passes 6 - wake up the person EXERCISE ============================================ THIRD DAY FLUIDIFICATION BALANCING HPA AXIS BALANCING HEMYSPHERES THREE COLOURS ( I A O ) These are for preparing the client After these are some ideas of working FLUIDIFICATION WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT Introduction to magnetism DEMO SKIN PROBLEMS and explanation of FLUIDIFICATION and POSITIVE FASCINATION Demonstration Exercise Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state. A very simple way is the "fluidification". FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions MAGNRETC MAPS Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS: Rage, Presentation on a theory on the work of magnetism. A research done by a finnish University shows the different zone of activation in the body FOUR TYPES Presentation of four types Choleric Lymphatic Sanguine Menlancholic ========================================================= EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active. Se we have a first big split HYPER HYPO Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER? Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism Many times we observe that HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic) LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic) SANGUINE (ambo-tonic) MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic) Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it. NOTE: The ancient connected the four types of personality to the four elements. Choleric FIRE. Very active. Hyperexcitation. Phlegmatic WATER. Submissive, Passive. He can do a lot of attention to his inner sensations. Sanguine AIR. Very sensitive and capable odf reacting. Melancholic EARTH. Material is his sensations, less emotions. More specific thinking. BURN-OUT How to deal with BURN OUT. We can think that many times burn-out happens in life after excess activity We will do a TWO STEPS THERAPY: First: give energy to the person and make her active Second: find (may be with regression) the reason why s/he was so active. Sometimes we can have IDENTIFICATIONS (I feel worthless, I feel powerless etc... behind the extreme work of the person. In a next day we will see how to de-identify) ======================== HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method) MAGNETIC POINTS When we heal we work 1 - both on general systems 2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point" Two types of opposite point. OR passing through the person OR to the opposite side ============================================================= MOVING THERAPY ============================================================= INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT LEVELS of MOVING THERAPY Level 1 - the Trabona Method USE: to balance the person HISTORY: Trabona is a student of dr. Paret that created this method that is very effective METHOD: you will tell to the client that "everyone has a pendulum inside himself". Or "everyone has his own rhytm". Begin creating movement in your client. Add magnetic passes (you will discover he will have a higher sensitivity) For level two, that is a sort of a self-hypnosis, we will search for a desire we want to work on: 1st we create the oculomotor blockage (optional) 2nd thinking to something we desire we see, going through three different desires, which one blocks you more the eyes Level 2 - Modified Akstein Method with non verbal hypnosis USE: For doing a self-hypnosis on yourself HISTORY: Akstein was a researcher that created Terpsichore Trance Therapy. He highly valued the work of Mesmer and he feels what he did was on his line He used music to create release state We agree with many of his tenets, but we prefer to use non verbal hypnotism as it is more corresponding to what we do Procedure: Begin with Trabona method a little to create a state of disposition Have the person look at a light and thinking what s/he desires. begin the movement (when looking at a light only back and forth, otherwise the trace will be not so good) and at a certain point ask her to breath from the nose and exhale from the mouth After have the person close the eyes - begin as in Trabona method Continue with non-verbal stimulations This method will create as a crisis but with a different way of doing. It is very good for self-hypnosis. We can create a movement similar to the crisis even without the negative emotion that normally we use to go in regression create catalepsy and after solve it ============================================== Introducing strong Somnambulism What is the key for deep somnambulism? It is very easy. We will before create ecstasy and after we will do a "non verbal induction" Ecstasy + Non Verbal It is easy that people doing such exercises has strong reaction SIDE RESULTS: Sometimes people goes into some sort of parallele reality (past lifes) In these case work as usual. The advantage of a past life is that the person can see how his life will evolve and the final consequences. We can see the past life also as a "metaphor" of his actual life. And working on the past life we can solve problems in the actual life ============================================= Doing outside exercises about presence (stop etc...) NOTE: presence outside is much more stronger ============================================= DAY 4 Explanation of earthly type and airy type The four meditations Water Including this exercise: In the ROOM Mirror exercise 2 people one will look himself in the mirror and the second will be an assistant at the begin we work normally, looking at the center after we begin inhaling and exaling clenching the fists and we look the right eye and after the left one We can give ourself a command: interlochl your finger and tell yourself blocked hands After assume presence position with interlocked fingers charges with open eyes (3 times) And DEVELOPING THE FORCE Earth Fire Air ============================================= Presentation of the muscolar preferences Earth - In the now Air - Projected in the future Water - we observe gaze and positions of the hands Fire - Focusing - we see very well when a person indicate somebody Question: In NLP we have three types Visual (similar to focusing) Kynesthesic (similar to watery) What about Auditory types? Answer: in general introverts are auditory. In psychology an introvert is somebody speaking with himself We can recognise auditory from : 1 - they speak with the left ear 2 - they are closed (arms / legs) 3 - we can recognise them on the spot because they have a lot of MICROMOVEMENTS ================================================ What we have seen were MUSCULAR PREFERENCES Now we will see how magnetic passes can change muscular preferences Exercise Check axially where a person is stronger Do passes from the weaker side. The person will become stronger Check speed in answer to fast movement toward the cheek (boxing position - but with the head turned in order to use only one eye) ================================================== DEMO OF WEIGHT LOSS TECHNIQUE ================================================== Afternoon ================================================== DEMONSTRATION OF MAGNETISM FOR WEIGHT LOSS ================================================== SELF HYPNOSIS WITH WATER Attentive explanation. The concept of INCORPORATION Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus) Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball Drink the water EXERCISE OF WEIGHT LOSS USES: inside a protocol for losing weight ELEMENTS: we eat both for nervous/psychological reason than for metabolic reason. We must work on both. It is Preceded by exercise of the water and WORKING ON THE THREE SYSTEM: Endocrine Nervous Psychological And after Solar Plexus and Front Wrists PROCEDURE First do a small hypnosis oculomotor blockage in case - you see how you want to be - you see a mirror you enter inside the mirror - you feel the sensation Now you begin to breath with TAURUS system If you have somebody helping you he will move your head. Otherwise you will do it Now if you have another person he will tell you that you are very capable And that in afew seconds you will open the eyes and see in the water as in a chrystal ball what you want to achieve Eyes open - drink the water Passes accompanying the water entering And now magnetic passes for weight loss ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Epiphysis and thyroid (send energy) Epyphysis and Pancreas Epyphysis and genitals NERVOUS SYSTEM Passes Calming passes with hand behind in a lower position Do them at third eye shoukders heart belly PSYCHOLOGY Do the principal organs as stomach liver splees intestines Touch now solar plexus and forehead WRISTS (touching the wrists as you are sending energy) In Chinese Medicine is said that all meridians can be found at the wrists But this concept exists also in the western medicine Repeat three times and after wake up the person REMEMBER Magnetism must be treated as sacred It is Better to do it in silence We must be in the NOW We can use verbal suggestions but only at the begin. Try to be SILENT In this way we will create a deep trance The mind will diffuse itself in the body. HOW TO LEARN IT - EXERCISE It is possible to doo in circles sometimes To learn better be in circle with the master demostrating After students can learn by themselves MAGNETISM In some way with the former technique we worked with the body. GENERAL PRINCIPLE: Passes when done near an organ will harmonize or stimulate it It is as we "speak directly with the body" ========================================================= Can this exercise be done even for different goals? Yes, this exercise can be done even for different goals You can put whatever you want inside the glass of water (as suggestion) ========================================================= DOING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE GLASS OF WATER ALONE BY YOURSELF Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus) Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball Drink the water Do passes on yourselves and after - block your ears and let yourself going deeply - If you are in the evening you can go to sleep - an other method will be presented and will be with movement and will be done the fifth day ========================================================== FAST RELEASE TECHNIQUE DEMO of crossed breathing followed by Hypno-Drama Afternoon Release technique based on crisis and called crossed breathing NAME OF THE TECHNIQUE: Technique of the crossed breathing EFFECTS: Strong crisis, fast effects USE: alternative to classic crisis technique, when you work a second time with somebody etc... NOTE: the technique of the crossed breathing, when done with the legs, can have a use for SEXUAL problems PHYSIOLOGICAL REASONS WHY THE PERSON GET HEALED: Polyvagal theory could be behind the reasons for the good results of such a technique Have the person think to a problem In case we can increase it What problems give (gave) to your life? How would your life be without it? Woould you like to become free? HOW TO DO IT: Create before a state of fascination Tel to the client Follow me Inhale and close your arms Exhale and open your ams This technique create a confusion in the mind as we breath in and out in a way very different from what we would do normally With words and non verbal communication we invite to be free After we can continue on the floor on the floor the legs of the subject wil be put in position And he will have reaction on the floor This technique is also good for self crisis. You can do it by yourself and ============================================= We can do the Campanelli Method at the end to balance Tell the client Tell the client to close his eyes and keep the mind free 1 - touching occiput and forehead 2 - warm blow 3 - turning the head 4 - touching head and sternum together 5 - movement on the arms 6 - again head and sternum 7 - again movement on the arms 8 - keep a moment a hand on the front and the other one over the belly (without touching) 9 - end of exercise =============================================== TECHNIQUE FOR STOP SMOKING CAMPANELLI Look to the slide =============================================== DI PISA Di Pisa used a method putting a person "against" the smoking habit Look the person into the eyes and speak of the problem of smoke (first fascination) Lower his body (he will feel a bad taste at the throat) Put him up - touch the solar plexus Make him hypersemnsitive to smell You will tell him that in a moment we will lighten a sigarette first time he smokes it will taste as nothing second time will taste as Hay third time he will cough Continue keeping the ligthned sigarette under his nose so smoke will enter You can repeat with a second sigarette Finish with direct suggestion looking him into the eyes ============================================= TECHNIQUE FOR ALLERGY Allergy and Food intolerance are very similar. They are as a "PHOBIA" of the immune system We can treat allergy with the technique of the LIGHT and the ball behind the occiput. The ideal is to know the FIRST TIME a person got allergy We can after do a technique where we will have our client find something similar to the allergene but with no effect We will have imagine to eat progressively less of the product of no effect and more of the allergene. Percentage will change 90% 80% etc... Progressively you will create change ================================================= Gypsy self hypnosis what it is ANSWERS =============================================== Exercise at the mirror putting away false identifications USE: this is an advanced exercise. Its goal is putting away the false personalities that are parasiting ourself. METHOD: to do that we will A get with a mirror to a state of high PRESENCE at ourself At this pooint we will see the image in the mirror and understand that the I we are seeing in the mirror has a false idea about himself This exercise is divided in various steps 1 - look at yourself in the mirror 2 - create the first reactions 3 - WORK ON BOTH HEMYSPHERES begin breathing and at the same time clench fists looking before right eye and after left eye 4 - CREATE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTION AND DISCHARGE inhale fully, your breats must be full begin moving arms as putting away tension exale fully until your lungs will be empty REPEAT 2 or 3 times 5 - Now look the YOU in the mirror Think - this person think to be (ex.
