For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.) 4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.) 5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.) 6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.) 7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.) 8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.) 9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.) Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh. =============================================== We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY (with hypnodrama) This demo will be done in the following way 1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM 2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA" This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow. =============================================== MAGNETIC CIRCLE Objective: introduce people to non verbal hypnosis / show different reactions / showing the power of a group Hermetic interpretation: we create an egregore Sociological interpretation: we create another space outside the normal reality Magnetic circle - note: magnetic circle will contain: sounds (that you demonstated some moments before) - magnetism - ecstasy and the persons will fall down at a certain point because they will no more be able to manage the intense energy we develop =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND ================================================ DEMO and exercise Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles. When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides 1 - Put a person in the center in static position 2 - Approach her from different sides Right Left Front 3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition). A circle will feel him as you are "around" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also "proxemics" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING. Is the client that reacts CHANGE PARTNER ========================================= What is "the test" The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is "the human pendulum". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved? 4 close the eyes 5 repeat 6 You can do on the four problems area Health Family Relationship Success You will discover where the person has most problems USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS You can use the test to do "silent questions" Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy Do you think we can get results in these session? Is it something relating to your childhood? (if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways) USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions ================================ INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS We will introduce: sounds Breathing The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky) 1 - come to a person using sound 2 - use magnetism and catalepsy 3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I 4 - Lay the person down using the sound 5 - add passes 6 - wake up the person EXERCISE AT THE PARK ============================================== Introducing strong Somnambulism What is the key for deep somnambulism? It is very easy. We will before create ecstasy and after we will do a "non verbal induction" Ecstasy + Non Verbal It is easy that people doing such exercises has strong reaction SIDE RESULTS: Sometimes people goes into some sort of parallele reality (past lifes) In these case work as usual. The advantage of a past life is that the person can see how his life will evolve and the final consequences. We can see the past life also as a "metaphor" of his actual life. And working on the past life we can solve problems in the actual life ============================================= Doing outside exercises about presence (stop etc...) NOTE: presence outside is much more stronger ============================================= In the ROOM Mirror exercise 2 people one will look himself in the mirror and the second will be an assistant at the begin we work normally, looking at the center after we begin inhaling and exaling clenching the fists and we look the right eye and after the left one We can give ourself a command: interlochl your finger and tell yourself blocked hands After assume presence position with interlocked fingers charges with open eyes (3 times) ============================================= projection of Videos In the videos we see different types of ANINAL HYPNOSIS as well demo of NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM and we learn that we can develop it even with different styles. ============================================= DEMO: New Fascination induction for ZOOM Main elements: Taurus + following movements + fractionation Psychic push Advice on how to help a person to fall backward To have the person going down we can keep her under the shoulders and put on the floor ============================================ THIRD DAY Brief explantaion about what ecstasy is (following a question) Physiological state and explanation of it in comparison with the work of NARDI In ecstasy we activate a part of the brain that normally we dont use and it is not attributed to any MBTI type Introduction to magnetism Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS DEMO SKIN PROBLEMS and explanation of FLUIDIFICATION and POSITIVE FASCINATION Demonstration Exercise Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state. A very simple way is the "fluidification". FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method) MAGNETIC POINTS When we heal we work 1 - both on general systems 2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point" Two types of opposite point. OR passing through the person OR to the opposite side Exercise for student Find some problem they have FLUIDIFICATION WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT Both stimulate the mind in a specific way Finish the exercise with DI PISA affirmative suggestion you can both - speak while having the hand near the point - not speak and just look After wewill affirm he is well, strongly looking him into the eyes NOTE ON THE USE SUGGESTION FROM DI PISA Learn to give suggestions, practice speaking in a confident, positive tone, try to convince. Every day for a quarter of an hour, repeat some suggestions aloud and perform exercises number 2 and 3 of the second series to the letter. You will acquire formidable power and become "masters" by laying the foundations for wonderful hypnotic success. The word of the hypnotist, when he speaks with conviction and confidence and especially when he thinks intensely that the subject must obey, is a force. I realized this when I was influenced by my teacher. As he spoke every word increased the effect of the influence, until it became irresistible. I have often realized the power of verbal suggestions by experimenting with thousands of subjects. You don't need to memorize the suggestions; you can change the terms without compromising your success. The important thing is to put yourself within the reach of the subject's intelligence. You cannot use the same vocabulary with a university teacher and a semi-illiterate pastor. Experience then taught me that it is not so much the way of imparting suggestions, finding appropriate terms and speaking slowly and with conviction, as a kind of personal magnetism derived from practice, from the tension of the will, from self-confidence and from security of the required phenomenon which contributes greatly to success. The difference in the results obtained by two different hypnotists on the same subject comes from the personal magnetism they have been able to develop. The strength of the gaze trained to stare for a long time. period, avoiding blinking, and training to give continuous suggestions, will allow you to quickly put your hypnotic power to the test. The results will come. =================================================== Some hints to exercise on magnetic voice. 1 - BE PRESENT 2 - try to say "my name is ..." this a the tone of voice that your body is connected to the sense of "being sure" 3 - notice that when you tense the pelvic pavement the voice will be more sure (as hermetically you were drawing energy from the EARTH) ================================================== HYPNODRAMA METHOD 1: Mixed with non verbal hypnosis USE: to open the mind and evocate emotional reactions. It is a sort of CRISIS that the client see from the exterior. HISTORY: the first to develop this technique (the part with the two hands) has been the french psychologist Messinger. Exercise of the hypno-drama 1 - Have the person thinking to a problem 2 - induce the person with non verbal ways 3 - put him on the floor 4 - continue with the hypnodrama 5 - when catalepsy ends he can open his eyes How do you feel? 6 - use a light to enhance even more the enlarged awareness state the client has METHOD 2: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a "history" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ========================================================= Afternoon INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT LEVELS of MOVING THERAPY Level 1 - the Trabona Method USE: to balance the person HISTORY: Trabona is a student of dr. Paret that created this method that is very effective METHOD: you will tell to the client that "everyone has a pendulum inside himself". Or "everyone has his own rhytm". Begin creating movement in your client. Add magnetic passes (you will discover he will have a higher sensitivity) For level two, that is a sort of a self-hypnosis, we will search for a desire we want to work on: 1st we create the oculomotor blockage 2nd thinking to something we desire we see, going through three different desires, which one blocks you more the eyes Level 2 - Modified Akstein Method with non verbal hypnosis USE: For doing a self-hypnosis on yourself HISTORY: Akstein was a researcher that created Terpsichore Trance Therapy. He highly valued the work of Mesmer and he feels what he did was on his line He used music to create release state We agree with many of his tenets, but we prefer to use non verbal hypnotism as it is more corresponding to what we do Procedure: Begin with Trabona method a little to create a state of disposition Have the person look at a light and thinking what s/he desires. begin the movement (when looking at a light only back and forth, otherwise the trace will be not so good) and at a certain point ask her to breath from the nose and exhale from the mouth After have the person close the eyes - begin as in Trabona method Continue with non-verbal stimulations This method will create as a crisis but with a different way of doing. It is very good for self-hypnosis. We can create a movement similar to the crisis even without the negative emotion that normally we use to go in regression create catalepsy and after solve it ================================================== DEMONSTRATION OF MAGNETISM FOR WEIGHT LOSS ================================================== SELF HYPNOSIS WITH WATER Attentive explanation. The concept of INCORPORATION Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus) Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball Drink the water Do passes and after - block your ears and let yourself going deeply - If you are in the evening you can go to sleep - an other method will be presented and will be with movement and will be done the fifth day =================================================== Day four EXERCISE OF WEIGHT LOSS USES: inside a protocol for losing weight ELEMENTS: we eat both for nervous/psychological reason than for metabolic reason. We must work on both. It is Preceded by exercise of the water and WORKING ON THE THREE SYSTEM: Endocrine Nervous Psychological And after Solar Plexus and Front Wrists PROCEDURE First do a small hypnosis oculomotor blockage in case - you see how you want to be - you see a mirror you enter inside the mirror - you feel the sensation Now you begin to breath with TAURUS system If you have somebody helping you he will move your head. Otherwise you will do it Now if you have another person he will tell you that you are very capable And that in afew seconds you will open the eyes and see in the water as in a chrystal ball what you want to achieve Eyes open - drink the water Passes accompanying the water entering And now magnetic passes for weight loss ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Epiphysis and thyroid (send energy) Epyphysis and Pancreas Epyphysis and genitals NERVOUS SYSTEM Passes Calming passes with hand behind in a lower position Do them at third eye shoukders heart belly PSYCHOLOGY Do the principal organs as stomach liver splees intestines Touch now solar plexus and forehead WRISTS Repeat three times and after wake up the person REMEMBER Magnetism must be treated as sacred It is Better to do it in silence We must be in the NOW We can use verbal suggestions but only at the begin. Try to be SILENT In this way we will create a deep trance The mind will diffuse itself in the body. HOW TO LEARN IT - EXERCISE To learn better be in circle with the master demostrating After students can learn by themselves MAGNETISM In some way with the former technique we worked with the body. GENERAL PRINCIPLE: Passes when done near an organ will harmonize or stimulate it It is as we "speak directly with the body" ========================================================= EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active. Se we have a first big split HYPER HYPO Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER? Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism Many times we observe that HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic) LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic) SANGUINE (ambo-tonic) MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic) Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it. NOTE: The ancient connected the four types of personality to the four elements. Choleric FIRE. Very active. Hyperexcitation. Phlegmatic WATER. Submissive, Passive. He can do a lot of attention to his inner sensations. Sanguine AIR. Very sensitive and capable odf reacting. Melancholic EARTH.
