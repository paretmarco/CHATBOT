Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together. EQUALIZATION . How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.) 4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.) 5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.) 6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.) 7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.) 8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.) 9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.) Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh. =============================================== We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY (with hypnodrama) This demo will be done in the following way 1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM 2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA" This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow. =============================================== END DAY 1 =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND DEMO: Just using small sounds and small touches a person is put on the floor We do it to show it as the sense of balance is fundamental The mental structure is connected to physical structure ================================================ Example of something similar in the art performance. In many modern art performances the performers try to create reactions in the spectators Even in theatre. Peaple sit down and reactions are created People must be well seated in order to receive the most stimulations ================================================ HOW TO TEST IF THE PERSONNIS ENTERING IN STATE? There are two basic ways of testing 1-checking the balance of a person 2-with the use of catalepsies For checking the balance we put a hand on the shoulder of the person or we do small touches. ================================================ DEMO and exercise Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles. When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides 1 - Put a person in the center in static position 2 - Approach her from different sides Right Left Front 3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition). A circle will feel him as you are "around" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up Don't touch to much the person in thsi first exercise. ================================================ Q&A Can I do with a lying person? Yes you can do, but you must be very expert. In reality when a person is standing each time we see his/her reaction in the balance and how he she holds it. When a person is laying we can only guess ================================================ NOTE Different types of people Some people will react more, some people less. Sometimes we must REDUCE stimulations and we will have stronger reactions Notice how these stimulations are something you cannot oppose to How can you oppose yourself to a sound? We see for exemple that music can work even on very rational people. ================================================= Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) ==================================================== There are two ways of doing non verbal hypnosis: Accompanying Symbolic We advise not to be completely symbolic as you risk to lose yourself in excessive thought and symbolism It is better to mix the two styles You will follow your client through some main axes ===================================================== MAIN AXES: Approaching (Attack) / Going Away (Abandon) Touching or arriving from the right side (father) / Touching or arriving from the left side mother Direct touch (male) / Soft touch (female) / no touch or just small touch (for people that doesnt like touch) The same you can have in sounds ===================================================== In combination with the former elements you can use "words without a meaning" These are words as DOS, DOOH, DEST that have no specific meaning and the mind will create imagination around these sounds ===================================================== INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also "proxemics" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements Use also the principles of the four steps therapy: - Concentration of the mind - Hypnosis - Solutions - Amplifying solutions GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING. Is the client that reacts CHANGE PARTNER ========================================= At the end you can add HYPNODRAMA As the person has catalepsy lift the two hands, put them in front You can suggest (if you want) with words that the right hand is the father side and the left the feminine side ================================================== HYPNODRAMA METHOD 1: Mixed with non verbal hypnosis USE: to open the mind and evocate emotional reactions. It is a sort of CRISIS that the client see from the exterior. HISTORY: the first to develop this technique (the part with the two hands) has been the french psychologist Messinger. Exercise of the hypno-drama 1 - Have the person thinking to a problem 2 - induce the person with non verbal ways 3 - put him on the floor 4 - continue with the hypnodrama 5 - when catalepsy ends he can open his eyes How do you feel? 6 - use a light to enhance even more the enlarged awareness state the client has ========================================= FOCALIZING THE CLIENT on the problem We must focalize the client on his problem if we want to get results. It can be done with a former dialogue ========================================= Why we finish with the hypnodrama? Because our goal is bringing the person to the center. With the hypnodrama we bring the two halves together ========================================== The imbalances reveal in fact us something that is not equally weighted in both sides They can correspond to an excessivity SYMBOLISM True and false symbolism Exactly as in society, sometimes some symbols can be identified just with one side of the individuals, while in reality are of the whole person. When they are identified with just one side they become charged psychologically. True symbolism: Archetypes derivated (or false) symbolism: archetypes charged with psychological significance Example 1: the cross: symbolism Archetype: 2 dimensions that cross themselves, the human being Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : to suffer , it is as the symbolism is owned by just a part of the human being Example 2: The mother Archetype: the earth Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : what is conceived about own human mother. In reality is not the archetype of the mother. It is a part of you that monopolizes the archetype. Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it) Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself ARCHETYPE (ex verticality) it exist into the Non verbal self False symbolism (excessive rigidity) We can increase ========================================== METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a "history" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ============================================ THE SWAYING TEST What is "the test"? The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is "the human pendulum". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved? 4 close the eyes 5 repeat 6 You can do on the four problems area Health Family Relationship Success You will discover where the person has most problems USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS You can use the test to do "silent questions" Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy Do you think we can get results in these session? Is it something relating to your childhood? (if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways) ============================== END OF THE SECOND DAY ============================== USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions ================================ INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS We will introduce: sounds Breathing The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky) 1 - come to a person using sound 2 - use magnetism and catalepsy 3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I 4 - Lay the person down using the sound 5 - add passes 6 - wake up the person EXERCISE ============================================ THIRD DAY FLUIDIFICATION BALANCING HPA AXIS BALANCING HEMYSPHERES THREE COLOURS ( I A O ) These are for preparing the client After these are some ideas of working FLUIDIFICATION WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT Introduction to magnetism DEMO SKIN PROBLEMS and explanation of FLUIDIFICATION and POSITIVE FASCINATION Demonstration Exercise Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state. A very simple way is the "fluidification". FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions MAGNRETC MAPS Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS: Rage, Presentation on a theory on the work of magnetism. A research done by a finnish University shows the different zone of activation in the body FOUR TYPES Presentation of four types Choleric Lymphatic Sanguine Menlancholic ========================================================= EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active. Se we have a first big split HYPER HYPO Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER? Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism Many times we observe that HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic) LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic) SANGUINE (ambo-tonic) MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic) Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it. NOTE: The ancient connected the four types of personality to the four elements. Choleric FIRE. Very active. Hyperexcitation. Phlegmatic WATER. Submissive, Passive. He can do a lot of attention to his inner sensations. Sanguine AIR. Very sensitive and capable odf reacting. Melancholic EARTH. Material is his sensations, less emotions. More specific thinking. BURN-OUT How to deal with BURN OUT. We can think that many times burn-out happens in life after excess activity We will do a TWO STEPS THERAPY: First: give energy to the person and make her active Second: find (may be with regression) the reason why s/he was so active. Sometimes we can have IDENTIFICATIONS (I feel worthless, I feel powerless etc... behind the extreme work of the person. In a next day we will see how to de-identify) ======================== HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method) MAGNETIC POINTS When we heal we work 1 - both on general systems 2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point" Two types of opposite point.
