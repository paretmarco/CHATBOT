INTRODUCTION Have you ever wanted to get to know yourself better and to understand your potentiality? Do you want to learn how to use communication in an efficient way? Are you interested in creating satisfactory relationships? If your answer is yes to any of the above, then you should know that various techniques exist that can help you on such a journey. Enjoy your Reading! PART ONE: THE MAGIC WORLD OF NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING If you are reading this guide, it means that you can imagine yourself learning more about how to change your life and profession to the better. The aim of this guide is to introduce to you a “know how” that can accompany you forever, providing you with a personal experience that helps strengthening both the body and the mind. Everyone deserves the best; the amazing thing is that we can choose between really living or simply existing, allowing events to control us. The methods presented here have been introduced to help you become the person that you have always wanted to be, to achieve your results and to understand your most inner self. “What I am today is indicative of what I have learnt, not what is my potential”. (Virginia Satir) Have you ever been so sure of yourself that you are happy simply because you feel you own your life and you are the author of the situations of success that you have created around you? This is a state of excellence that you can create yourself, even if you don’t yet know how. What is taught in our school is a method that allows us to discover the structure behind this experience and to be able to recreate it. It is possible to create a type of engineering of emotional states in such a way that the best possible state can be used at any given moment. The aim of NLP and its associated methods is to provide you with the methodology, that puts into effect an astonishing process of growth of the possibilities within you. Thus, you will present yourself in a new, efficient way when faced with daily life situations. You already possess these things. You have to strengthen the courage and will to find trust in your feelings and internal being and learn how to follow them. In such a prospective, to “really” live can be a choice and not a chance. There are a large number of people that let there brain run at breakneck speed, wasting a lot of time experiencing things that they would prefer to avoid. It is important to realize that in this way the brain becomes a “room” so full of constant chattering that solutions have difficulty in entering due to lack of space. It is certainly useful to think about problems in order to solve them, but at the same time, it is also useful to start forming alternative strategies to be able to avoid them recurring. “Difficulties are the fire that shapes our character”. (Anthony Robbins) The above phrase might mean that every time we find ourselves faced with a problem, we can identify the most efficient strategy to confront the situation. What we called “difficulty” before becomes an opportunity to shape and improve ourselves, an invitation to act. How much ownership do we have of our thoughts? Many people are prisoners of their own brain. It’s as if they were chained to the back seat of the bus with someone else at the wheel. But who is this someone else? They are our unconscious reactions and plans. We are the ones who should be driving our “Personal Bus”. If we don’t give some directions, we will face the risk that we will either travel randomly on our own behalf, or other people will find the way to direct it in our place. NLP and the other methods that we present to you are a unique opportunity to learn how to use the brain in a more functional way. Neuro-linguistic programming is nothing more than an educational process, therefore, the other methods can open up the way to contact with that which we realize to be a “natural state”. Another interesting metaphor is the following: Let us imagine now that our brain is a machine that is missing an off switch. If we do not give it something to do, it will continue to churn around and at the end, it gets bored!!!!! How many of you are obsessed with particular thoughts or situations that you would like to resolve? Saying to yourselves, “I would like to be able to push them out of my head”. Think about the extraordinary ability that you have to able to put them there in the first place! Our point of view is that our brains are phenomenal. A brain is capable of doing amazing things and the problem is that it is often not what it cannot learn but the fact that it learns too well and too quickly. For example, the risk of a single traumatic event is conditioning us for years; in other words, a single experience can leave an indelible trace. In reality, nevertheless, you can go further than simply freeing yourself of these automatic conditionings. Thus, our abilities can be taught to move towards a state which brings us satisfaction. OUR NEEDS AND WHERE TO FIND ADEQUATE RESOURCES If we ask various people, we will discover that their different needs are: the need to know themselves better and improve their relationship with themselves, the need to open themselves to others and to be understood, to have personal security, to be positive, to unblock themselves, to have self-confidence, etc… It is important to realize that everything necessary to satisfy these needs to be successful people is INSIDE US! What we are saying here is that NLP 3 and the other methods are opportunities to gain the right methodology to bring everything out.
