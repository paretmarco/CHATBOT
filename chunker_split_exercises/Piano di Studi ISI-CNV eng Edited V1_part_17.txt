Our aim is to help the knowledge of the old tradition of magnetic hypnotism in which we were initiated. We have updated them to the most modern quantum technologies. When we began this project we were alone. Now we see how many people, most of them our students have gone on this path. These techniques are not only about psychology. They are also about energy (they are the western path of what in East is kundalini and similar techniques). They also rely on non-verbal communication. Non-verbal communication is very subtle, and the non verbal goes deeper than the verbal They can be useful in therapy, in personal relationships and in every social situation. And also for health, habits, personal development and more… Most of books contain only a piece of this ancient and secret wisdom. The complete system encompasses a lot of exercises, both physical as well as mental. These exercises are rejuvenating and give energy to the practitioner. They help to have a powerful impact and expand the human potentialities And also be the first step of a Path to Presence that we could call “the ultimate path” We propose you these techniques in a practical formation called "Mesmerismus®". Even if the name contains the name "Mesmer", the techniques are more ancient than that of Mesmer. They encompass Fascination, Magnetism and Non-Verbal Techniques It is a secret school and dr. Paret, the director, brings this ancient knowledge in the present world… updating them to the most recent researches and to the quantum level They are very natural. They awake man to himself: there, in himself, he can find maximum power. In order to know when we will have the next courses use this form: http://www.pnl-nlp.org/courses/contactus.php You can also visit the website http://www.hypnotisme.com/hypnotisme/hypnotism-mesmerism.htm and http://www.mesmerismus.net FORMATION AND PATHS The training that the school ISI-CNV offers has a university pattern. These words mean, that to reach the different professional levels you must complete a series of training modules giving each one a certain number of credits. To get the Final Certification you must submit a research at the end of the path. In some paths certification is important, in others it has no meaning as there are paths also for a deep personal development. Our school offers also standard training courses, you can still shape these paths according to your needs, to allow a full path and personalized service. After the course there is even the possibility to become part of our organization, as we are growing and expanding these knowledges. Possible PATHS: MAGNETIC PATH – MAGNETISTA This path is for people aiming at exploring and becoming immediately able in the mesmeric and fascination techniques. It is the most current one. It is the exoteric (it means “for all”) version of the ancient tradition updated to the Quantum level. Courses: Mesmerismus Level 1 – Fascination Course – Presence TRAINER IN MAGNETISM AND MESMERISM (Level 1) Complete the magnetic path. Repeat it at least once - follow the Advanced Seminar (path “hermetic magnetism” or path “NLP-3”) and Train the Trainer days + personal coaching TRAINER IN MAGNETISM AND MESMERISM (Level 2) Complete the magnetic path. Repeat it at least once completely and partly as an assistant. - follow the other path of the Advanced Seminar + personal coaching Non verbal communication and nlp-3 diploma AND TRAINERSHIP Our school specializes in non verbal communication and is the most advanced institute in this field. NLP-3 is mostly based on non verbal communication instead as on the verbal one. It goes far beyond classical NLP. It is a “magical” NLP with different techniques and connects it with the enneagram and what is presented in the magnetic path. Very useful for persuasion and subliminal non verbal communication. In conjunction with the magnetic path it opens up to a level of a certification permitting to teach NLP-3 as well to Practitioner and Master in NLP and NLP-3 QUANTUM COACHING PATH This Path is for people that want to apply these techniques as Coaches. PRESENCE AND HERMETICISM PATH This is a very personal path that on higher levels can only be followed in smaller groups. Follow the Magnetic Path + Magnetic Hermeticism + Atoum Circles (it is an ancient knowledge about presence) CERTIFIED HYPNOTERAPIST + ADVANCED MESMERIST CERTIFICATION This course is for people wanting to start a practice starting from scratch and also for people already with experience in hypnotherapy that want to learn some traditional modalities that could be used in conjunction with magnetism and fascination. It encompasses both the magnetic path, the advanced course (NLP-3 and Non Verbal Communication Diploma) and a module of traditional hypnosis for the magnetic path, where certain techniques of traditional hypnosis are explained magnetic MASSAGE CERTIFICATION Follow the magnetic path + personal coaching. master trainer – mentor IN MESMERISM Follow all courses of the school. Methodologies We offer an organized curriculum for studies in the most powerful techniques of Magnetism, NLP-3, Mesmerismus © and Quantum Technologies and Coaching. The programs are open to professionals and people seeking a higher education in these matters. We naturally recognize that the needs of professionals are different from those of adolescents and young adults - mature learners have a wealth of knowledge and skills which adolescents and young adults often lack. Further, we recognize that the career and family responsibilities of mature learners are often incompatible with the demands of years of on-campus, classroom attendance. The learner earns credit through intensive courses on the field and then married with independent off-campus study evaluated during our intensive seminars. We also use modern information modalities such as; audio and video taped lectures, computer tutorials, WWW site information links that are given to our students, mentor-guided reading programs and supervised-held study via skype. Finally we have some ritual moments in our courses where the student is introduced to these techniques in the traditional way. Magnetism/Fascination updated to quantum techniques Welcome to our formation, your door to unleash the true power of your mind and yourself. Our discipline is a modern and powerful tool to create powerful and practical results. Our Quantum Magnetism technology is also suitable for deep processing, in all the domains of life. It originates from the convergence of ancient traditions and techniques in which we were initiated, passed down to us during our research and of which we are the last exponents, and this paradigm with which we are able to give expansion and scientific foundation paradigms applied to the quantum mind, which is the most evolved exists in the modern world to treat our relationship with the world. And 'in fact the discipline's most successful predictions to be controlled in a world where we know that the exceptions are always a possibility.
