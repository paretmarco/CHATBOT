Our aim is to help the knowledge of the old tradition of magnetic hypnotism in which we were initiated. We have updated them to the most modern quantum technologies. When we began this project we were alone. Now we see how many people, mosto of them our students have gone on this path. These techniques are not only about psychology. They are also about energy (they are the western path of what in East is kundalini and similar techniques). They rely also on non verbal communication. Non verbal communication is very subtle, and the non verbal go deeper than the verbal They can be useful in therapy, in personal relationships and in every social situation. And also for health, habits, personal development and more… Most of books contain only a piece of this ancient and secret wisdom The complete system encompass a lot of exercises, both physical as mental. These exercises are rejuvenating and give energy to the practitioner. They help to have a powerful impact and expand the human potentialities And also be the first step of a Path to Presence that we could call “the ultimate path” We propose you these techniques in a practical formation called "Mesmerismus®". Even if the name contain the name "Mesmer", the techniques are more ancient as them of Mesmer. They encompass Fascination, Magnetism and non verbal techniques It is a secret school and dr. Paret, the director, bring this ancient knowledge in the present world… updating them to the most recent researches and to the quantum level They are very natural. They awake man to himself: there, in himself, he can find maximum power.

After the course there is even the possibility to become part of our organization, as we are growing and expanding these knowledges.

It is the exoteric (it means “for all”) version of the ancient tradition updated to the Quantum level. Courses: Mesmerismus Level 1 – Fascination Course – Presence TRAINER IN MAGNETISM AND MESMERISM (Level 1) Complete the magnetic path. Repeat it at least once - follow the Advanced Seminar (path “hermetic magnetism” or path “NLP-3”) and Train the Trainer days + personal coaching TRAINER IN MAGNETISM AND MESMERISM (Level 2) Complete the magnetic path.

NLP-3 is mostly based on non verbal communication instead as on the verbal one. It goes far beyond classical NLP.

Methodologies We offer an organized curriculum for studies in the most powerful techniques of Magnetism, Nlp-3, Mesmerismus © and Quantum Technologies and coaching. The programs are open to professionals and peolpe seeking a higher education in these matters.We naturally recognize that the needs of professionals are different from those of adolescents and young adults - mature learners have a wealth of knowledge and skills which adolescents and young adults often lack. Further, we recognize that the career and family responsibilities of mature learners are often incompatible with the demands of years of on-campus, classroom attendance. The learner earns credit through intensive courses on the field married with independent off-campus study evaluated during our intensive seminars. We use also modern information modalities such as audio and video taped lectures, computer tutorials, WWW site information links that are given to our students, mentor-guided reading programs and supervised-held study via skype. Finally we have some ritual moments in our courses where the student is introduced to these techniques in the traditional way. Magnetism/Fascination updated to quantum techniques Welcome to our formation, your door to unleash the true power of your mind and yourself. our discipline is a modern and powerful tool to create powerful and practical results. Our Quantum Magnetism technology is also suitable for deep processing, in all the domains of life. It originates from the convergence of ancient traditions and techniques in which we were initiated, passed down to us during our research and of which we are the last exponents, and this paradigm with which we are able to give expansion and scientific foundation paradigms applied to the quantum mind, which is the most evolved exists in the modern world to treat our relationship with the world. And 'in fact the discipline's most successful predictions to be controlled in a world where we know that the exceptions are always a possibility. And the language and life are systems where the exceptions are the norm. from our many years of practical experience in psychology and techniques of mind from the experience of our seminars and courses, where we have experienced countless moments of discussion and experimentation of the techniques described. from the theoretical competence being responsible for what has been the most innovative school in Italy over the last ten years. from measurements taken with various equipments with which we have verified many of the techniques that we teach Deep concepts for the development of man Our system is extremely innovative and has not only external applications, improving your mental power. It is also a way of human growth. A basic concept is the man in the universe and his subjective reality. It starts from the consideration that all the psychological disciplines seek to develop human potential, but no one questions the goal of achieving greater skills and abilities, and how to integrate these elements with awareness. Only accessing subjectively and really the complete structure of man you can figure out how to access its potential. This has consequences: In an organization it becomes clear how every performance is linked to the "human factor" and the "sense" that people feels in the organization.
