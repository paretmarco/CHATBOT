PROGRAM AND SYNTHESIS OF THE ADVANCED COURSE DONE IN RUSSIA Goal of the course: Learning what ecstasy is and how can be of benefit in therapy Deepen the techniques of the first level and in specific learn different methods of inducing crisis Learning a specific framework called non verbal hypnotism using also the power of sound to induce a state With non verbal hypnotism and ecstasy combined create deep trances Learning the basis of a non verbal therapy where we do regressions in an "evocative" way using just non verbal communication Magnetism techniques for well being Some Quantum and Hermetic Paradigms Many exercises of self hypnosis (with the mirror, with water with movement) 1st day general demo Taurus - Movement - Ecstasy What is TAURUS? Taurus is the name of a very powerful technique that can induce deep hypnosis fast in everyone BENEFITS: it can induce deep trances and somnambulism fast, it can be done with groups, it introduces the client to open up METHOD: It is based on a specific breathingand instructions For explanation of Taurus see the slide LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 In the advanced course we do these elemnts more than what on the slide: we add LIGHT we add PASSES and we work with a regression. Doing a regression after having done a Taurus inductio is very easy It is also possible to use TAURUS to induce ECSTASY ============================================== MAGNETIC ECSTASY Magnetic ecstasy is a technique that will create a PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE History: Ecstasy has a long history, even ancient people worked on ecstasy Use in therapy: at the end of a therapy. It will help the client to have even a deeper transformation There are different level of ecstasy. The more a person will have worked before the higher he will go Physiological interpretation: strong activation of an answer of the dorsal parasympathetic system Hermetic interpretation: developing the "quintessence" for going in a verticality / energy goes up / white phase in alchemy Principal points to work on to create Ecstasy 1 - Bring before the person into the somnambulism using some of the techniques we learnt in the basic course 2 - do crossed passed from the right shoulder downward to the left and from the left shoulder downward to the right (in this way the two lines will cross about at the height of the heart) 3 - do Passes from the 3rd eye to the crown 4 (optional) in case put a Hand on shoulder 5 - you can also put both your hands on his head and do as you want lift him 6 - You can also do Movements on the spine 7 (optional) you can also use Music A good music is Moonlight Sonata on Glassharp of Beethoven (look on youtube - very good the interpretation of Robert Tiso) WHAT IS ECSTASY? Ecstasy is like moving on a vertical plane. Difference with classical somanmbulism: more spiritual sensations, less images MUSICAL ECSTASY Music will be felt differently and deeper in the state of ecstasy We will do a real musicotherapy Music will transmit suggestion Use slow music with a lot of high tones to increase ecstasy ========================================== We can also work ecstasy in front of a mirror Exercise with mirrors in pairs History: This exercise is from the "blue pearl" serie. In origin it was done without mirror Benefits: holding the "ball" 60 secs in front of the coccix will increase magnetism Goal of this exercise: activating ecstasy in front of the mirror and reinforce magnetism HOW TO DO IT One person will be in front and the other behind This exercise is for creating ecstasy in front of the mirror Have the person look into himself without blinking At a certain point have the person press the hands together as pressing a ball behind do passes on him and activating the points on the spine (occiput and coccyx) have the person breathing along the body as he/she does doing the charges ======================================== Additional exercise with a mirror Name of this Exercise: reconnecting earth and sky Go in front of a mirror. An assistant will be behind you. Look now at yourself without blinking This continous gazing will bring you in a trance. We will call it "Going into the fluid state" Now you will activate both hemyspheres looking first to the right eye and after to the left eyes and at the same time using Breath + Looking (assistent do passes) The assistant will do po passes upward form the third eye to the crown Progressively we will create ecstasy. At this point the assistant will close the eyes of the subject and have him sitting on a chair He will do the three sounds O - I - A. In case he can repeat the sound. Each sound is relative to a part of the body Reconnect to the earth We will finish with a STOP! ========================================= In the former exercise we saw the passes to activate the spine These movements are the same that we can use to work after to heal the spine EXERCISE to heal pains on the spine USE: every pain on the spine, discopathy 1 - Ask the person where he feels pain 2 - Find the point feeling it even yourself 3 - Note - You can find the point even moving the hand along the spine and seeing where you have reactions 4 - Create a magnetic state (activate the parasympathetic system) 5 - Lay one hand over the occiput and the other one over the cocciput Dont touch We can even switch hands so we will see different reactions and how polarities will affect the results We will see a reaction in the spine After you will work on the point where is the pain RESULTS: the pain will go away =========================================== How to do with Sciatica? Practically the system is similar. Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call "butterfly movements" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up. ============================================= Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on "warming the mercury" It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system - NORMAL - excitated this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown ============================================= For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes. We call this technique "closure of the senses" The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques: Closure of the senses Technique of the 10 plexuses CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION -. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient? The following: 1 ° Three passes with the thumb, from the top and the middle of the forehead, over the nose and towards the pit of the stomach; 2 ° Three with the index finger, starting from the middle of the eyebrows; 3 ° Three with the medium, starting from the center of the ears. 4. Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together. EQUALIZATION . How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.) 4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.) 5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.) 6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.) 7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.) 8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.) 9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.) Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh. =============================================== We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY (with hypnodrama) This demo will be done in the following way 1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM 2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA" This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow. =============================================== MAGNETIC CIRCLE Objective: introduce people to non verbal hypnosis / show different reactions / showing the power of a group Hermetic interpretation: we create an egregore Sociological interpretation: we create another space outside the normal reality Magnetic circle - note: magnetic circle will contain: sounds (that you demonstated some moments before) - magnetism - ecstasy and the persons will fall down at a certain point because they will no more be able to manage the intense energy we develop =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND ================================================ DEMO and exercise Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles. When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides 1 - Put a person in the center in static position 2 - Approach her from different sides Right Left Front 3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition). A circle will feel him as you are "around" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also "proxemics" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING. Is the client that reacts CHANGE PARTNER ========================================= What is "the test" The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is "the human pendulum". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved? 4 close the eyes 5 repeat 6 You can do on the four problems area Health Family Relationship Success You will discover where the person has most problems USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS You can use the test to do "silent questions" Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy Do you think we can get results in these session? Is it something relating to your childhood? (if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways) USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions ================================ INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS We will introduce: sounds Breathing The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky) 1 - come to a person using sound 2 - use magnetism and catalepsy 3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I 4 - Lay the person down using the sound 5 - add passes 6 - wake up the person EXERCISE AT THE PARK ============================================== Introducing strong Somnambulism What is the key for deep somnambulism? It is very easy. We will before create ecstasy and after we will do a "non verbal induction" Ecstasy + Non Verbal It is easy that people doing such exercises has strong reaction SIDE RESULTS: Sometimes people goes into some sort of parallele reality (past lifes) In these case work as usual. The advantage of a past life is that the person can see how his life will evolve and the final consequences. We can see the past life also as a "metaphor" of his actual life. And working on the past life we can solve problems in the actual life ============================================= Doing outside exercises about presence (stop etc...) NOTE: presence outside is much more stronger ============================================= In the ROOM Mirror exercise 2 people one will look himself in the mirror and the second will be an assistant at the begin we work normally, looking at the center after we begin inhaling and exaling clenching the fists and we look the right eye and after the left one We can give ourself a command: interlochl your finger and tell yourself blocked hands After assume presence position with interlocked fingers charges with open eyes (3 times) ============================================= projection of Videos In the videos we see different types of ANINAL HYPNOSIS as well demo of NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM and we learn that we can develop it even with different styles. ============================================= DEMO: New Fascination induction for ZOOM Main elements: Taurus + following movements + fractionation Psychic push Advice on how to help a person to fall backward To have the person going down we can keep her under the shoulders and put on the floor ============================================ THIRD DAY Brief explantaion about what ecstasy is (following a question) Physiological state and explanation of it in comparison with the work of NARDI In ecstasy we activate a part of the brain that normally we dont use and it is not attributed to any MBTI type Introduction to magnetism Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS DEMO SKIN PROBLEMS and explanation of FLUIDIFICATION and POSITIVE FASCINATION Demonstration Exercise Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state. A very simple way is the "fluidification". FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method) MAGNETIC POINTS When we heal we work 1 - both on general systems 2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point" Two types of opposite point. OR passing through the person OR to the opposite side Exercise for student Find some problem they have FLUIDIFICATION WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT Both stimulate the mind in a specific way Finish the exercise with DI PISA affirmative suggestion you can both - speak while having the hand near the point - not speak and just look After wewill affirm he is well, strongly looking him into the eyes NOTE ON THE USE SUGGESTION FROM DI PISA Learn to give suggestions, practice speaking in a confident, positive tone, try to convince. Every day for a quarter of an hour, repeat some suggestions aloud and perform exercises number 2 and 3 of the second series to the letter. You will acquire formidable power and become "masters" by laying the foundations for wonderful hypnotic success. The word of the hypnotist, when he speaks with conviction and confidence and especially when he thinks intensely that the subject must obey, is a force. I realized this when I was influenced by my teacher. As he spoke every word increased the effect of the influence, until it became irresistible. I have often realized the power of verbal suggestions by experimenting with thousands of subjects.
