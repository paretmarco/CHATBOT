NON VERBAL HYPNOSIS FOR WEIGHT LOSS This non-verbal hypnosis method for weight loss involves using water, breathing techniques, and passes on specific endocrine points/chakras and on organs. We also hold the wrists and we put hands on forehead and belly. The method can sometimes (rarely) induce a hypnotic crisis. You repeat the sequence multiple times. The method can be used to change any behavior, not just weight loss, and can be done silently. The method aims to help regulate the body and stimulate the nervous system, thyroid, and metabolism. The method creates normally a deep trance and can be used for deep transformation and healing.
