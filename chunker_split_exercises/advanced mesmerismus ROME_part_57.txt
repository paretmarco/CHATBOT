PROGRAM AND SYNTHESIS OF THE ADVANCED COURSE DONE IN RUSSIA Goal of the course: Learning what ecstasy is and how can be of benefit in therapy Deepen the techniques of the first level and in specific learn different methods of inducing crisis Learning a specific framework called non verbal hypnotism using also the power of sound to induce a state With non verbal hypnotism and ecstasy combined create deep trances Learning the basis of a non verbal therapy where we do regressions in an "evocative" way using just non verbal communication Magnetism techniques for well being Some Quantum and Hermetic Paradigms Many exercises of self hypnosis (with the mirror, with water with movement) 1st day =========================================NOT DONE IN ROME (general demo Taurus - Movement - Ecstasy What is TAURUS? Taurus is the name of a very powerful technique that can induce deep hypnosis fast in everyone BENEFITS: it can induce deep trances and somnambulism fast, it can be done with groups, it introduces the client to open up METHOD: It is based on a specific breathingand instructions For explanation of Taurus see the slide LEVEL 1) LEVEL 2 In the advanced course we do these elemnts more than what on the slide: we add LIGHT we add PASSES and we work with a regression. Doing a regression after having done a Taurus inductio is very easy It is also possible to use TAURUS to induce ECSTASY ============================================ BEGIN OF THE FIRST DAY ============================================ As Taurus in Rome was already done BEGIN THE COURSE Explanation of Ecstasis as the fifth state We put ourself in circle Breathing as for Taurus (without hand up) Stop breathing to much Pi quan Putting away from the head positive and negative thoughts Small touch Some people will fall Finishing Pi Quan Finishing with IAO This is for everybody in order to experiment We take the individual experiences Concept of Solve and Coagula Now we show individually ================================================= MAGNETIC CIRCLE Why we did a circle? Objective: introduce people to non verbal hypnosis / show different reactions / showing the power of a group Hermetic interpretation: we create an egregore Sociological interpretation: we create another space outside the normal reality Magnetic circle - note: magnetic circle will contain: sounds (that you demonstated some moments before) - magnetism - ecstasy and the persons will fall down at a certain point because they will no more be able to manage the intense energy we develop =============================================== MAGNETIC ECSTASY Magnetic ecstasy is a technique that will create a PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE History: Ecstasy has a long history, even ancient people worked on ecstasy Use in therapy: at the end of a therapy. It will help the client to have even a deeper transformation There are different level of ecstasy. The more a person will have worked before the higher he will go Physiological interpretation: strong activation of an answer of the dorsal parasympathetic system Hermetic interpretation: developing the "quintessence" for going in a verticality / energy goes up / white phase in alchemy Principal points to work on to create Ecstasy 1 - Bring before the person into the somnambulism using some of the techniques we learnt in the basic course (in this case begin with the technique of LAFONTAINE) 2 - do crossed passes from the right shoulder downward to the left and from the left shoulder downward to the right (in this way the two lines will cross about at the height of the heart) 3 - do Passes from the 3rd eye to the crown 4 (optional) in case put a Hand on shoulder 5 - you can also put both your hands on his head and do as you want lift him 6 - You can also do Movements on the spine 7 (optional) you can also use Music A good music is Moonlight Sonata on Glassharp of Beethoven (look on youtube - very good the interpretation of Robert Tiso) WHAT IS ECSTASY? Ecstasy is like moving on a vertical plane. Difference with classical somanmbulism: more spiritual sensations, less images MUSICAL ECSTASY Music will be felt differently and deeper in the state of ecstasy We will do a real musicotherapy Music will transmit suggestion Use slow music with a lot of high tones to increase ecstasy Ideas of the spheres (the music of the spheres) ========================================== We can also work ecstasy in front of a mirror Exercise with mirrors in pairs History: This exercise is from the "blue pearl" serie. In origin it was done without mirror Benefits: holding the "ball" 60 secs in front of the coccix will increase magnetism Goal of this exercise: activating ecstasy in front of the mirror and reinforce magnetism HOW TO DO IT One person will be in front and the other behind This exercise is for creating ecstasy in front of the mirror Have the person look into himself without blinking At a certain point have the person press the hands together as pressing a ball behind do passes on him and activating the points on the spine (occiput and coccyx) have the person breathing along the body as he/she does doing the charges ======================================== Additional exercise with a mirror Name of this Exercise: reconnecting earth and sky Go in front of a mirror. An assistant will be behind you. Look now at yourself without blinking This continous gazing will bring you in a trance. We will call it "Going into the fluid state" Now you will activate both hemyspheres looking first to the right eye and after to the left eyes and at the same time using Breath + Looking (assistent do passes) The assistant will do po passes upward form the third eye to the crown Progressively we will create ecstasy. At this point the assistant will close the eyes of the subject and have him sitting on a chair He will do the three sounds O - I - A. In case he can repeat the sound. Each sound is relative to a part of the body Reconnect to the earth We will finish with a STOP! IN ROME THESE TWO EXERCISES HAVE BEEN FUSIONED IN ONE AND WE HAVE HAD THE PERSON FALL A LITTLE IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSISTANTS ========================================= In the former exercise we saw the passes to activate the spine These movements are the same that we can use to work after to heal the spine EXERCISE to heal pains on the spine USE: every pain on the spine, discopathy 1 - Ask the person where he feels pain 2 - Find the point feeling it even yourself 3 - Note - You can find the point even moving the hand along the spine and seeing where you have reactions 4 - Create a magnetic state (activate the parasympathetic system) 5 - Lay one hand over the occiput and the other one over the cocciput Dont touch We can even switch hands so we will see different reactions and how polarities will affect the results We will see a reaction in the spine After you will work on the point where is the pain RESULTS: the pain will go away =========================================== How to do with Sciatica? Practically the system is similar. Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call "butterfly movements" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up. ============================================= Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on "warming the mercury" It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system - NORMAL - excitated this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown ============================================= For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes. We call this technique "closure of the senses" The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques: Closure of the senses Technique of the 10 plexuses CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION -. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient? The following: 1 ° Three passes with the thumb, from the top and the middle of the forehead, over the nose and towards the pit of the stomach; 2 ° Three with the index finger, starting from the middle of the eyebrows; 3 ° Three with the medium, starting from the center of the ears. 4. Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together. EQUALIZATION . How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.) 4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.) 5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.) 6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.) 7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.) 8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.) 9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.) Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh. =============================================== We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY (with hypnodrama) This demo will be done in the following way 1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM 2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA" This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow. =============================================== END DAY 1 =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND DEMO: Just using small sounds and small touches a person is put on the floor We do it to show it as the sense of balance is fundamental The mental structure is connected to physical structure ================================================ Example of something similar in the art performance. In many modern art performances the performers try to create reactions in the spectators Even in theatre. Peaple sit down and reactions are created People must be well seated in order to receive the most stimulations ================================================ HOW TO TEST IF THE PERSONNIS ENTERING IN STATE? There are two basic ways of testing 1-checking the balance of a person 2-with the use of catalepsies For checking the balance we put a hand on the shoulder of the person or we do small touches.
