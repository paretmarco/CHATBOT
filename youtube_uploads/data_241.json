Animal magnetism, also known as mesmerism was the name given by a German doctor Franz Mesmer in the 18 century to what he believed to be invisible natural force possessed by all living things, including humans, animals and vegetables. He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing and he tried persistently but without success to achieve scientific recognition of his ideas. Magnetic passes work without touching the person. Learn the most powerful non-verbal hypnosis techniques in Dr. Marco Paret's school.
