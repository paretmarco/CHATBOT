In the video we will see images from his non-verbal hypnosis masterclass in Rome, where his students formed a magnetic circle and the hypnotized subjects were deeply fascinated by Dr. Paret. The group even tried to hold on to the person, but he had powerful strength and couldn't stop following the fascinator. This is how powerful non-verbal hypnosis is.
