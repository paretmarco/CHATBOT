This state makes the subject posable like a doll. Lift the arm up and then let it go, and the arm stays right where you left it.\nCatalepsy can occur in small muscles groups, or through the entire body. If your eyes are closed, and then you go into catalepsy, you\u2019ll find that you can\u2019t open them. Of course, you must accept that suggestion in order for it to be fulfilled.
