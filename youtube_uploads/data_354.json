{"title": "NON-VERBAL HYPNOSIS FOR ANALGESIA - SHE CAN'T FEEL PAIN", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezx3F4sJSh4", "description": "Dr. Marco Paret's students are doing non-verbal hypnosis exercises on his masterclass. They demonstrated the state of analgesia, in which the subject does not feel any pain. The woman in the video was deeply hypnotized, while the hypnotist took some scissors and grabbed her hand with them. The subject didn't feel any pain at all. After waking her up, the student used the scissors on her hand again, but this time it hurt her, because she was already out of hypnosis. All of this was achieved without the use of any words.
