This leads to a new age philosophy that promotes letting go of the thought or belief that interferes with manifesting what you want. The unquestioned presupposition, thoughts create reality. This will be discussed later. Adult Problem State: Trying to control others through thought, imagining you can control others' behavior through thought or by acting a certain way. Adult Problem State: Self blame. "It must be my fault that things didn't work out." It's my fault if someone doesn't like me." Both these strategies give the person an illusion of control over others' behavior, even if they are counter- productive or self-destructive strategies. 3. In addition to "I created it" and grandiosity, another first level process is reinforcement. In this stage the basic mind structures of the infant are re-enforced by the world so the developing infant believes its original world view to be correct. This occurs when a dysfunc- tional family reinforces a behavior, like smiling or being passive. The family responds to the child when it doesn't need anything. The parents seem happy. The child decides or cognizes that smiling will get her needs met, not anger nor actions.
