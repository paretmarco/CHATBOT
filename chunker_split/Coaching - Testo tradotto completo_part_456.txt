It is by now an ascertained fact, and one which even the State has realized, that we are fond of gambling and are prepared to invest a bit (or even a lot) of our own money in lotteries, in the contest for big gambling prizes run at national level, as with Superenalotto in Italy, and in the jackpot machines which bars are furnished with, that is, in games where the chances of victory are exceedingly low, if not actually non-existent. We like the idea of trying to outsmart the system and earn a lot very quickly by investing a meagre sum. That is exactly what happens in the markets, especially as regards the young traders shorn of adequate experience. An aspect shared by many obese individuals is the great attention they pay to the issue of food. They would gladly like to keep a check on what they eat, and yet, as soon as they spot a plate of pasta, they lose their self-control. In a similar way, many traders, too, only focus on money and thus become its subservient slaves. A nice aspect which we should direct our attention to is, by contrast, the requirement that one should act well.
