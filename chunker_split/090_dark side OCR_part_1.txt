OF THE i‘filf. The Mext Step The inner child is not all precious and wonderful. By grasping the ways we continue to use the frozen and outdated trances of survival, we deprive ourselves of some essential areas of human experience. Wolinsky calls this limiting function the "dark side of the inner child." John Armin/3mo from the foreword The Dark Side of the Inner Child "AWAKENING" is a key word: It means we have awakened from our personal vantage point or per- spective. Everything looks totally different... to be freed from that vantage point and awaken from that vantage point so that you suddenly see everything differently—and the practical application of this awakening...is that you change.
