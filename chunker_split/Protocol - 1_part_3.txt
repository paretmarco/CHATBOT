At that moment, tell yourself mentally: “my arm must become relaxed and fall again.” Your arm will then fall down again freely. Now liquid and solid kinds of matter are going to obey you. Domination of liquids and solids teaches you to be independent of external impressions and all kinds of pains. Repeat mentally: “Now my entire body must relax.” At this point, everything inside you stops, other than breathing. Your eyes remain open. At this point, say “my breathing must stop”, and with these words stop breathing. “I must resume breathing” and you resume breathing. At this point, again say, “my breathing must stop”, and with those words stop breathing. “I must resume breathing” and you resume breathing. Like solids and liquids, air also obeys consciousness. We are now working on thought. The eyes will again remain open during this exercise. Now think of the street where you live, or of another place, and say to yourself, "at present I want to concentrate my thoughts on this street." Close your eyes. Imagine all the details of the houses and their occupants. STOP in mental space - see, feel, hear The mind obeys consciousness as it does all other kinds of matter. Consciousness is the only ruler of our internal being. You will have to repeat these exercises until you are capable of carrying them out under any conditions, for example, while walking. The goal is to concentrate on yourself, on your genuine I as a spiritual being.
