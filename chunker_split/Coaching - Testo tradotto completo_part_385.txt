The more frequently you are going to make use, in that fashion, of the entire will to power at your disposal, the quicker will be the growth of such will to power in terms of its strength, until it will eventually turn into a potent agent of your existence. The large majority of people believe they are actually WILLING, when in truth they do no more than DESIRING at best. Once you are able to learn how to will, as opposed to merely desiring, you will be able to work wonders, and to exercise, over whoever falls within the sphere of your action, an influence which shall truly be miraculous in nature. The bulk of people, in fact, have never developed their own power and will. They are unaware of how one should develop that either, and the little they have of such twin forces is a sheer accidental result or one engendered by a chance stroke of luck. This in no way implies that desire might not prove useful.
