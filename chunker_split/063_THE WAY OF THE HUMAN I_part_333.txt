In order to do this, we will look at developmental psychology and its possible parameters and combinations of spiritual trances so that we can become aware of and dispel our trances, thus becoming more human. 215 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANCE-.FERENCE MERGER TRANCE-FERENCE Merger trance-ference can best be described as the event during which someone merges and fuses with another. This is an early childhood boundary issue, wherein the infant believes she/he is still merged with mommy. In other words, the child believes they are their mother. Furthermore, although this is a normal developmental process, the child sees Mom as omniscient. People who are stuck at this level of development demonstrate particular types of behaviors and trances as they grow older. For example, in present time, we might call this type of person an "empath." This merger trance-Terence can make the appearance of great contact and even psychic abilities. Actually, the adult is very age-regressed and infantile, transfering mom onto others and then merging with them. The empaths who cannot stop automatically merging with others, lose themselves and what they feel. Instead, they take on the other person's feelings.
