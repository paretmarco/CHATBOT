Acting well denotes having a goal to pursue, managing money properly, and being realistic and present to the situation by endeavouring to do one's best. We can notice that, nowhere in the sentence we utilized to describe the import of â€œacting well", does the word "money" appear. One of the rules governing the workings of the mind is: Every thing we draw attention to is seen as if through a magnifying glass. It seems to be larger. We step into a kind of trance wherein all we are able to perceive is the monetary aspect. If, however, our sole focus is money, the emotional impact will be extremely strong, we will lose sight of the line we are seeking to pursue, and we will be incapable of engaging in a good activity of trading. The recommendation to be given in this regard is to devote a bit of time to defining your objective before you begin to actively engage in trading, unless you have decided to throw away your money merely because you relish the emotion of playing or taking part in gambling.
