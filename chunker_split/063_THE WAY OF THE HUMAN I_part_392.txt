This yields greater freedom since your connection is directly with yourself and the world rather than using an intermediary step (mantra or prayer to reach yourself). In the words of the Sufi poet-saint Rumi, "Prayer leads to trance." Why? Because it buffers us from experiencing present time. When I say this in workshops, someone will usually become upset with me.

The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THE TRANCE OF DETACHMENT Detachment is often sought after but sometimes it is the trance of detachment. The trance of detachment looks like detachment but actually it is often times a defense against feeling. According to object-relations theory, the defensive detachment is the way the infant defends against the feeling of separation from Mom. In other words, in order to "not feel" the separation from mom, the child becomes prematurely detached. Unfortunately, this defensive premature detachment is sometimes labeled as acceptance, distancing, or more spiritual.
