An important factor behind success will be detected by us once we simultaneously pause to resolve on acting tenaciously and on incessantly persevering until we have actualized our intended goal. Such a kind of firm resoluteness ought to be imparted, more than by a conscious effort of our will, by a sort of intense prayer which is going to pervade the core of our being, and which is going to be given renewed impetus by the excellence of our cause, as well as by sensing the fact that it forms part of a global plan. Second passage: The mental multiplication of the idea We refer, by the term “multiplication and absorption of the idea”, to the operation which comes after presentification. This operation is not one which is invariably required. On some occasions, indeed, it might even be omitted. It is of benefit, however, in executing the more complex variety of operations. It consists in the fact that it multiplies the energy of presentification, and lets it be absorbed by the body through the technique of the light.
