When I want you In the night When I need you To hold me tight Whenever I want you All I have to do is dream Everly Brothers Trance dreaming occurs as the observer disconnects the child from the family or world. The child loses itself as it begins to dream. Actually, this is the purpose of the dream: to create a better world inside, to handle the pain of outside. Unfortunately, the child who is dreaming remains time frozen; the observer creates a dream within the child that likewise is disconnected from the world. In other words, in order to dream the child disconnects from the world and disconnects from the body. This trance, which is created by the observer, disconnects the child and is the way the child now survives.
