With love, your brother Stephen The Way of the Human 9 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness F CHAPTER III WHY QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY? I f we were to trace the history of psychology dating back to the early Greek philosophers, we could appreciate that psychology evolved from man's search to find the answer to the ultimate ques- tion: WHO AM I? Historically, this question of who we are has been asked for thousands of years ever since people began to recognize a sense of self, or a separate knowing. This enabled self-analysis to occur and flourish. Religions and spiritual systems emerged whereby people imagined that something larger than themselves "existed"â€” a supernatural source. With the advent of psychoanalysis via Sigmund Freud, psychology developed as a path to explore this self. But the self was seen as possessing a dark and perverse unconscious whose instincts were a source of pain, conflict and problems. The ego was the mediator of these wishes, drives and desires, which Freud called the Id. The superego was the parental and societal regulator of the Id. The battle between the Id and superego drew boundaries where the "I" (or ego) could find a place to exist.
