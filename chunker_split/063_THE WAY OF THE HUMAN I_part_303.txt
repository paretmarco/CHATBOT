If you want to lose weight, you can use this meditation when you're hungry, i.e., focus your attention on hunger as energy rather than on a food fantasy and notice what happens. That's a whole meditation but you can't do it if you're not hungry. ________________ Chapter VIII You can use the sensations and joy of a chocolate chip cookie or an ice-cream soda or whatever. Take your awareness away from it and meditate on the sensations. To paraphrase the Vijnana Bhairava, Focus your attention on the delight (as energy) rather than on the object of delight (chocolate, etc.). If it's sexuality, meditate on the delight, rather than on the object. If you're having sex with somebody, you're more than likely focusing on the person. Turn your attention away from the person toward the delight itself and see what the experience is. With foodoit's the same. There's really only one teaching that Swami Muktananada ever had and that was to meditate on yourself. This can be seen at the biological dimension as meditating on the delight as energy rather than on the object of delight as food (or a sexual object).
