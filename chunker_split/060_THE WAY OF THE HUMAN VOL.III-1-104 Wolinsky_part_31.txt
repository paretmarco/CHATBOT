Wolinsky:What I would like for you to do first is to have an image of the controlling mom over there (other side of the room) and the lineage that goes with this behind. So you have the controlling mom and then her mother, and then her father as the army officer (lineage) behind them. And then the tinkering dad. Does he have any lineage that you are aware of? Bill:He just reminds me a lot of his grandfather. I saw the similarities between the two. Wolinsky:Well, let's have your tinkering, busy dad here and his lineage behind him. How does this gaping wound and this energy around it feel to you as you look at this? Bill:I notice it. The energy is not as much but the wound is more up this way. (Toward the middle of his chest.) But the energy is lower. Wolinsky:Prior to you taking on your mother's wound, what was your experience? Therapeutic Note Here I make the assumption that he might have taken on some of his mother's wounds.
