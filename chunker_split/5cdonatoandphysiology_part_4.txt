The Abbe Faria (1817) departed even more from the original standpoint and pretended that suggestion alone, without the aid of any fluid agent, could put to sleep any person who had faith. It is noteworthy that in any case Faria didn't deny fully magnetism, and he instead affirmed in one of his books that the Baquet of Mesmer could have magnetic effects, even if he affirmed that magnetism was not necessary at all to produce sleep. This was also the opinion of Henri de Cuillers (1822) who proposed the terms hypnobates and hypnoscopes and who preceded Doctor Braid by eighteen years. In 1841 this latter gentleman, who was a doctor at Manchester, after having followed the magnetic s√©ances of the French magnetizer Lafontaine, also denied all fluidic action. He attempted to explain the production of somnambulism by cerebral exhaustion resulting from long concentration of the eyes on an object offering little surface. He gave to his system the name of hypnotism.
