Sitting, place in front of you an empty bottle in which you will introduce a glass funnel. In the bottom of the funnel place some cotton wool, then fill the funnel with water. The water then will descend slowly in the bottle filtering through the cotton. The exercise consists in sticking your attention to the decreasing level of liquid. You do not have to distract. During the exercise the pupils must remain constantly fixed on the liquid’s level, resisting the invitation of the eyelids that would like to close. If you find that in the meantime, you diverted your attention, or if the pupils come off even for an instant from the liquid, the exercise has failed and everything is to be done again. If you do not have a glass funnel, observe instead of the decreasing level in the funnel, the increasing level into the bottle. Later you will resume the exercise complicating it, straining not to hear the noise of the liquid going down. (See further, exercises of elimination). Exercise 11 Necklace. Get amber or glasses necklaces, whose grains can scroll at pleasure on the thread holding them. The exercise is to count necklace’s grains without thinking of anything else. Begin to count a few, and then gradually increase the number. The Indians, to whom this exercise is familiar, not infrequently count many thousands of grains not minding about what is happening around them and without diverting mind on other thoughts.
