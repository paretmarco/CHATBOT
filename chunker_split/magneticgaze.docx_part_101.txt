We in fact come across some people who are for example unable to feel one part of themselves, such as their own emotions. They often have small pupils, and their look is then described as being “ice-cold”. They are the individuals who in common parlance are referred to as “cold”. Emotions flow out through the body and, frequently, the inability to experience feelings reflects a denial of the sensations experienced by the body. Some exemplars of this human category are so detached from their own selves that they are even unable to experience such primary feelings as hunger or pain. It is indeed significant that our current society nurtures the quality of coldness, and that at times it fosters in that regard an urge to be hyper-rational, i.e. dissociated from feelings and associated with thoughts (rationality). We also get the opposite of dissociation, which is sometimes simultaneously present with it, and that is hyper-association [51]. Indeed, we find in the personal history of “cold” persons that there are moments in the past where they have suffered traumas which they still experience at a physical level. When they recover their spark, their look undergoes a transformation, and the pupil widens.
