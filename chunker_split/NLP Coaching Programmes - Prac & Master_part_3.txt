Your presence must move people. You can only do that if you live, breathe and walk your talk. Coaching is more than just a profession, it’s an identity. It’s who you are. You have a responsibility to the people who put their trust in you. Hence the focus of this master track is to take your basic NLP Coaching skills to an entirely new level. In addition, we will focus on: Communication: your ability to articulate your ideas and beliefs in a way that compels people to listen. How to inspire, focus and mobilise teams. How to ensure change means progress. Change is automatic, progress isn’t. How to know when to ask, when to suggest and when to command. Eliciting, aligning, and designing values.
