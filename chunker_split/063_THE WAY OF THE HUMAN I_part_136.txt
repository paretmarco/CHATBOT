Anything that you do not know about, you are the slave of; anything you know about The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness you can be free of. Therefore, we meditate to know and be free of the unknown material in our consciousness. UNCOOKED SEEDS The external world is oftentimes neglected in both psychological and New Age spiritual circles. It is imagined and thought to be dominated by our beliefs, traumas, etc., hence the New Age expression, "Our thoughts create reality." But thoughts are on one dimension and the external world is on another. They are connected but they have different functions. Remember, thoughts help to create our subjective internal reality but not necessarily our external reality. This represents the collapsing and confusing the thinking dimension with the external dimension. Imagine a guru who sits in a protected external world where all his needs are met, food, clothing, etc., He is able to sit somewhere in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., Change the context (the external) and his unprocessed psychology (thoughts, etc.,) comes up for him. For example, when gurus come to America or Europe, they get into money and sex.
