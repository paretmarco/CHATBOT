In other words, the gravitational pull of the sun and earth meet through your BIOLOGICAL CORE and combine to hold the biological "you" (your body) up. Your BIOLOGICAL CORE is the physical and biological manifestation of ESSENCE. It should be noted that Quantum Psychology is presently doing research on the possibility that the dimension ruling the BIOLOGICAL CORE is not gravitational but electro-magnetic.7 Your False Core (to be discussed in Volume II) is the idea you have about yourself, which surrounds your BIOLOGICAL CORE. It is the underpinning and collapse within the body which are mirrored in your muscles. However, the False Core is an image you hold of yourself and try to overcome psychologically and biologically—it is not you. It is an "I" thought the nervous system produces after the fact. Why is it not you—because "you" were "there" before the "I" thought arose. Ida Rolf, the founder of Rolfing, used the metaphor of "sleeve and core." She called the exterior muscles "the sleeve."
