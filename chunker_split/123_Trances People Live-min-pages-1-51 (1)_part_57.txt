Nothing sticks, nothings gets interrupted in its flow. It's a very rich, very free space to be in. I feel at my best in that state—especially when I can carry it into situations. At my job, large volumes of things pas i work me —people's requests and demands, personnel dynamics, political considerations, and so forth. I have trouble when it feels like all these elements come and Chit something solid---that would be your trance state. When the outer flow hits something solid in me, I begin to lose my good feeling and feel myself shrink down and contract (trance). Then I get confused, disoriented and even a little bit dissociated. I can't keep track of things, I can't process the flow anymore. Everything sticks, stops, and halts. I literally have to stop and go outside, or go into a vacant room and just "space out" for a few minutes. I let myself veer hack into that expanded space and then I feel better. I feel like I can cope again.
