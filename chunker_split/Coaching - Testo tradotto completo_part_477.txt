Even though the concepts we have set out here above are relevant to other dimensions of life as well, we are going in this context to examine some of these points in greater detail from the visual angle of trading specifically. The hypnotic role played by “Expectations” Expectations play a most important role in respect of whoever takes the decision to work in the financial markets. If a market is starting an upward swing, if it is, in other words, at the initial stage of a bearish trend, the reason why that is so is the fact a larger number of people are buying in the expectation that prices might rise further, in order for them to sell their assets later at a monetary premium. We should always bear in mind that markets represent the sum-total of a myriad of different individual psyches. How do we build expectations, however? People's expectations are grounded on their personal convictions and experiences.
