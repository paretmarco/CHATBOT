This is the biological realization of the interconnection and oneness of everything. It is truly a physical experience. To illustrate, several years ago I was giving a workshop in Kansas City. There was a woman there who was deeply age regressed and even began singing. When I lost awareness of "my" BIOLOGICAL CORE, I felt really separate from her." I noticed, however, that when I dropped into my own BIOLOGICAL CORE, I felt one with her BIOLOGICAL CORE. I could see the pain in her eyes and felt the essential biological experience of compassion. It should be noted again that body workers should not fall into the trap that "if we handle the body, the images too will get handled." Not so. This has been a major flaw of understanding in many of the most popular systems and subsystems of today, i.e., Feldenkrais and Rolfing. The images of the body, as well as the body itself, are holographic. However, you need to follow the Quantum 141 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Psychology Principle: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. If there is an image problem, handle it at the thinking dimension.
