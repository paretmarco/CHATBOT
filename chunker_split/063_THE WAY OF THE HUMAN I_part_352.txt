Two people might be behaving in a power-tripping way (i.e., being manipulative). The first person is aware of what therare doing, feels bad about it, but cannot stop it. The second person is not aware of what they are doing, and hence, doesn't feel bad about it. The first person's process is not characterological because they feel bad and have awareness; the second person's is characterological because they not only feel no remorse, but they are unaware of their process. Not being aware and feeling no remorse are hallmarks of a characterological disorder. TRANCE-FERENCUCOLINTER-TRANCE-FERENCE RELATIONSHIPS At this point, I would like to expand the parameters of tranceference/counter-trance-ference to include not only therapist/client, teacher/student or guru/disciple, but many of our other relationships. Once again, we need to look back on our definition of trance-ference as an age-regressed state, with a lack of awareness by an individual. This causes him or her to move from the present-time to the past-time self and, consequently, relating to an internalized—rather than a present-time—other. The past-time self has associations, emotions and memories, and transfers them onto the present-time other. When this occurs awareness goes to sleep.
