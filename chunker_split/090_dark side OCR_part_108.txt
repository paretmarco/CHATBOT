In this system, the spouse or family can say or re-enforce the inner child's self-talk, thereby reinforcing her problems. For ex- ample, an inner child phrase, "What' s wrong with me?" can be reinforced when the family or the spouse says, "What's wrong with you?" Inner Dialogue â€¢ 67 Self-talk is not always verbal; it can be nonverbal, or silent. The individual can infer or intuit through silence or nonverbal cuing. As an example, a parent that is silent, never enquiring about the child' s well being, might deliver the message, "Nobody is interested in you." Self-talk is always part of a problem and is implicit in many trance states. Where does Self-Talk Come From? An unprogrammed person, or a child before all the beliefs and ideas are suggested by the parents, is a pure observer or witness to life. The observedust observes; things happen or don't happen and the open blank slate of the observer is just present. The beauty of this observer is that there is no judgment, such as this is bad or that is good.
