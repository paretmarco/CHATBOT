This will enable us to develop a multi-dimensional functional awareness which leads to the underlying unity which "I" call our quantum nature. How does one fully integrate, develop, and reach what is so adamantly sought by the human potential movement and the spiritual aspirants of the East? Simply stated: Where do self-actualization and self realization meet? They meet in the development of multidimensional awareness as a possible aid to discovering "WHO YOU ARE" without negating or losing any part of human nature which includes the world which is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. The challenge is in being human as both a biological and psychological (thinking) emotional being, without losing our loving ESSENCE or the awareness of the underlying unity of the VOID (NOT-I-I) which is Quantum Consciousness. The Way of the Human asks us to do just that, to be fully human and develop our multidimensional awareness as a possible aid to discovering WHO WE ARE; in other words, to maintain awareness at all levels without exclusion but with total inclusion. The Way of the Human is where SELF-REALIZATION and SELF-ACTUALIZATION meet. ________________ Chapter 1 Throughout all three books, "I" will talk about dimensions of awareness.
