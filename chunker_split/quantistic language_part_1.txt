Quantistic thinking and ericksonian techniques. Language is a key element for many hypnotists. But it is not the only method we can use to communicate with the unconscious mind. On some aspects it is the less adapt, as each time we interact using language we wake up the logical mind. If we read the old books we can easily discover how ancient hypnotists were able to achieve stunning results, in many cases approaching more than the 95% of success, without uttering any word at all. The key reside in the power of the non verbal communication. Let's learn now how we can use non verbal communication to do what many hypnotists call pacing and leading. Hypnotic pacing is a statement about a patient's actual experience that they know is true. It can then be linked to a suggestion or an idea. The linked suggestion gains credibility by association. But why in reality pacing is so effective? Pacing has two main effects: the first is to bring the attention to the perceived reality of the subject. The second is creating a link with the operator that the subject feel "think alike".
