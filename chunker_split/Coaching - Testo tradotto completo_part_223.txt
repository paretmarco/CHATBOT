Well, it serves the function of firmly entrenching in us this most important conviction, namely, that obstacles merely represent the accessory, and that the successful achievement is a certain reality so long as we want it, given that the concatenation has been proven to be a logical one. The faculty of “foretelling” is immensely helpful even with regard to what the self-persuading element which is implied by premonition. Whoever has set himself in motion as a result of having dreamt a particular state, will come across a far lesser number of difficulties on the path of its actualization. By continuously keeping inside ourselves, through “daydreaming”, a vision of our “own self” as being modified, the modification will then end up materializing in a most natural manner, through stages which are unperceivable, though each one of them is “sparked into being” (so to speak) at the right moment. After all, if one pays notice to how easy it is to induce in ourselves a form of muscular automatism by starting from the premise of a self-persuasive movement, it ought to be concluded a fortiori that a cerebral, ideational automatism is going to occur.
