will deliver transformation; this certainty is based on the object's nominated capacity to resuscitate the memory of early ego transfoimation. In arguing this, I am maintaining that...the search for the transformational object, and nomination of the deliverer of environmental transformation, is an ego memory (reenactment). ( p. 27). I recall in India, before I realized my pre-verbal automatic structures, spending years looking for4sacred objects to worship and trying to get them blessed by "sacred people." I remember there even being a process called prana-pratista which provided three ways of having a sacred object "enlivened,"'or made sacred so that you could worship it: 1. It could be done by the touch of a saint (a sacred person.) 2. It could be done by the seeker asking the energy or deity to sit inside the object so that you could worship it. 3. A Brahmin priest could perform a sacred ceremony to ask the deity to sit inside the object so that you could worship it. In fact, you were even asked what it was you wanted from the statute so that you could get the health, wealth, or enlightenment you desired.
