If one wants to be an achiever, if the discovery of new ways is something desired, it is then imperative to keep the eyes constantly open. Be present to your own selves and to the reality around you. Read, watch, observe, and reflect. Enlarge the scope of your mental interests. Seek information about every kind of subject. That is the path leading to a simultaneous increase in knowledge and power. The most potent incentive to observe is having an interest. Being interested stimulates the imagination. Whoever is interested in a matter does not limit his self to seeing the thing in itself, but moves from there into the further step of discerning all those aspects which are related to it. A certain object, the most mundane situation, might then offer several perspectives which are pregnant with potential results.
