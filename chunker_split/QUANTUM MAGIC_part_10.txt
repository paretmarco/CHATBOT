Walker also modeled information retrieval in "guess the card" experiments. Simple, classical, random chance would predict a smooth, binomial curve for the probabilities of getting the right answer versus the number of subjects making successful predictions at these probabilities. Walker's model predicts that the curve would have peaks at certain levels of probability of getting the right answer above those predicted by chance alone. Experimental data showed peaks at the locations modeled. However, more people were successful at the higher probability levels than Walker's model estimated. This is considered to be evidence of learning enhancement [5]. 863 SCIENTIFIC THEORY Mr. Walker's ideas and equations would only be hypotheses if it weren't for the fact that they have been tested experimentally and found to predict the results of experiments with reasonable accuracy [4,5]. The evidence meets the usual rules of proof for scientific theory, and this makes Walker's equations legitimate scientific theory. The non-local underlying wave patterns beneath manifestations of matter and energy that we hold in common with our surroundings allow us to influence reality and to obtain information about it using the power of the mind.
