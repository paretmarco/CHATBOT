For example, if my father beat me up when I was a kid and I say to myself, "He was a wonderful dad," that's a lie have to acknowledge and accept before the awareness of ESSENCE can become stabilized. If I do not, the resisted experience will pop up again and again, and pull awareness out of ESSENCE-I AM, etc., and put it back in the False Core-False Self. Lies cover things up and that takes energy. It is the loss of energy which drains your awareness level and "steals" awareness from ESSENCE. Things have to be acknowledged in order to have a stable, uninterrupted awareness of the Essential dimensions. The lies you tell yourself will pull your awareness away from ESSENCE, just as the external context (dimension) pulls up your "Uncooked Seeds."
