These exercises, when applied, give us the awareness that is needed to know the workings of this inner-child Identity so we can give it up and return to the present-time world. Futurizing Life is what happens to you, while you re busy making other plans. "Beautiful Boy,"John Lennon In John Lennon' s classic song "Beautiful Boy," Lennon de- scribes a phenomenon that we all experience: our bodies being in present time, but our minds moving into the future. "Futurizing" describes this process, whether it be planning for the future, imag- ing a catastrophe in the future, imagining a pleasant outcome in the future, or just imagining talking with someone in the future. This trance comes from the dark side of the time-frozen inner child and it keeps us out of present-time reality. In the immortal classic by H.G. Wells, The Time Machine, a person is able to go forward or backward in time. The problem with futurizing is 1) travel is not in "real time" but in imagined time, and (2) in the time machine, a switch gives the operator choice, with automatic futurizing, there is no choice.
