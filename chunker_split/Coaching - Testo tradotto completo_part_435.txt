The magnetic person, however, reinforces his prestige even on the strength of his mere non-verbal attitude and by posing questions, the combined effect of which is to place the other person in a state of difficulty 111 and establish a link with behavioural models which have been learnt in the past. Assuming that we already enjoy a degree of prestige in the eyes of a person we are facing, relying on one of the dynamics of fascination will visibly actualize the most far-reaching result. Through the look, we can succeed in causing our interlocutor to shift from an intrapersonal trance (the regressive experience) to an interpersonal one. Once he is settled in the latter, we might lead the transformation from there, by helping him attain a higher degree of self-consciousness. This, too, represents one of the dynamics of coaching, provided it is carried out shrewdly, insofar as it will lead the mentee, at the end of the process, to be more conscious of his self and his potential. Expectancy and prestige are two psychological mechanisms which strictly work hand in hand. If we express our ideas in a causally assured manner, they can be more easily adopted.
