If your awareness is unknowingly fixated on re-enacting, reinforcing, resisting or re-creating your False Core-False Self structure—whether it be spiritualized or not—there's no way you can be free. Developing awareness of all eight dimensions of manifestation and appreciating what they mean will help to explain this better. Below are brief descriptions of each dimension with an in-depth explanation that includes examples and exercises, etc. (to follow later). These eight dimensions of manifestation will be talked about throughout the entire trilogy: The first dimension is THE EXTERNAL DIMENSION. Here's the external world, here's my house, my room, I'm talking to you on the telephone. Here are all the objects and people in my life, and all the rules of the external dimension. For example, if I steal money from the bank, I will probably suffer the consequences. This is the first dimension. At first it seems easy because, of course, there is a person, there is a car, etc. However, can you notice that all the internal dialogues (trances) stop you from realizing and experiencing the present time external as the present time external. The Second Dimension is THE THINKING DIMENSION.
