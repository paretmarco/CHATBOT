(p. 17) In amplifying the Copenhagen interpretation of Heisenberg's Uncer- tainty Principle, Fred Wolf (1981) cites another physicist's view: Eugene Wigler, Nobel prize-winner in physics, believes that our consciousness alters the %%forld itself, because it alters how we appraise the future. That is, we experience the world the way we do because we choose to experience it that way. (p. 211) Wolf speculates: "How could there be a mechanical universe out there if the universe changed every time we altered how we observe Because of the active influence exerted by the observer in this Quantum universe, quantum theorist John Wheeler has added a significant refinement by changing the word observer toparttopa- or, stating that "no elementary phenomenon is a real phenomena until it is observed" (I lerbert, 1985, p. 18). Translated into Quantum Psychological terminology, this means that how we subjectively experience events, interactions, and our own inner self is observer-createdâ€”created by us. This realitY suggests a further one: that we as the knowers of our experience.
