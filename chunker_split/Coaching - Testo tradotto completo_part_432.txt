We might for instance get the “dreamer”, who, in hypnotic terms, should be translated as the kind of person that enacts a “time distortion” by living in an imaginary possible future. From his viewpoint, the present exists purely as an instrumental stepping stone to his dream. At that point, a person who is present might lead such individual wherever he wants, simply by getting in touch with the latter’s “dream”. The degree to which a person accepts our ideas is influenced by his expectation. By recourse to the look, we can eventually lead him into the present and help him plan things in an efficient manner. The regression to an earlier age One might likewise come across the kind of person who is experiencing a “regression to an earlier age”, and who will accordingly be inclined to behave like a child. This person, too, might be given assistance so that he can develop his potentialities, though, especially at the initial stage, we should try and understand his psychology and seemingly second his impulses. Trans-national analysis has examined this phenomenon.
