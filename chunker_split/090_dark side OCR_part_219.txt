This is a story of a child who gives up her self to take care of her parents in order to be taken care of herself. A child brought up in an alcoholic family might clean-up Dad' s bottle of booze, thinking that' s taking care of him so that she will be taken care of. Years later, if it trance-fers to God (transpersonal co-depen- dence), the child within might become a disciple of a guru. The philosophies match: I'll serve the guru, so he will take care of me. Notice how often gurus and religious systems abuse their vulner- able disciples sexuality and emotionally. It appears to the child Spiritualizing + 137 within the disciple that he is serving, but actually the guru is manipulating, playing out the parent side of the identity, getting people to take care of him in the name of spirituality. This is called service. People in spiritual circles say things like, "I just want to serve God." Translated, "I want to take care of Mom and Dad, so I will get taken care of."
