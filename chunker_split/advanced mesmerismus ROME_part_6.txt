IN ROME THESE TWO EXERCISES HAVE BEEN FUSIONED IN ONE AND WE HAVE HAD THE PERSON FALL A LITTLE IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSISTANTS ========================================= In the former exercise we saw the passes to activate the spine These movements are the same that we can use to work after to heal the spine EXERCISE to heal pains on the spine USE: every pain on the spine, discopathy 1 - Ask the person where he feels pain 2 - Find the point feeling it even yourself 3 - Note - You can find the point even moving the hand along the spine and seeing where you have reactions 4 - Create a magnetic state (activate the parasympathetic system) 5 - Lay one hand over the occiput and the other one over the cocciput Dont touch We can even switch hands so we will see different reactions and how polarities will affect the results We will see a reaction in the spine After you will work on the point where is the pain RESULTS: the pain will go away =========================================== How to do with Sciatica? Practically the system is similar. Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call "butterfly movements" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up.
