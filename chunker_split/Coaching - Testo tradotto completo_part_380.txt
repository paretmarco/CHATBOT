All the scholars concur on stating that these precursors of our race, who are part of our distant ancestry, were accustomed to gather together and move around in groups, and that they had leaders and an actual social structure. When we observe the behaviour of chimpanzees, we will notice how, very often, a pair of such animals keeps on watching one another until one of them makes room for the other. What happens is that, through the look, a social hierarchy is given rise to. Man, too, possesses such “inbred hierarchy”. Due to progress, such capacities acquire an increasingly greater importance in our society, given that the competition is becoming increasingly more cutthroat and that every success of ours depends on a multiplicity of contributing factors. It is indeed important for man, as far as his existence within society is concerned, to create a position for himself through the medium of work, his acquaintances and his behaviour. These represent utterly legitimate ambitions. However, in the light of the fact that one’s acquaintances, work and moral conduct are not always sufficient in themselves, it becomes imperative on us to acquire what we are lacking.
