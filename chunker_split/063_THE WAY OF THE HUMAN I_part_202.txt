With this understanding, let us look at the solidness of bone through the lesser solidness of muscle, moving through the less solid organs to the less solid emotions, through the less solid sensations, the less solid thoughts,, the less solid space inside the body, through the less solid EMPTINESS. This continuum is ONE SUBSTANCE, differing only in density yet totally interconnected and holographic, separated only by ,definitions and labels, and containing the entire universe within each. In other words, since everything from bone to EMPTINESS is made of the THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, then everything is the same substance as the entire universe. The old metaphysical statement that the macrocosm is in the microcosm and the microcosm is in the macrocosm can be changed in the light of quantum physics to the macrocosm is the microcosm and the microcosm is the macrocosm. THE QUANTUM APPROACH The Quantum approach says something much different. Quantum physics demonstrates to us that there is only ONE INDIVISIBLE SUBSTANCE. With this understanding, then, there is no separate spirit or soul which incarnates, but rather different orders of densities of substances, all of which are made of THAT same ONE SUBSTANCE.
