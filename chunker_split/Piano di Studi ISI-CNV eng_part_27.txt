Quantum Coaching Quantum coaching uses the system of luxmind inside a coaching paradigm to help a person to be herself and develop his/her potentials A quantum coach is a coach that develops creativity in his coachee and solves problems with creativity. Genius and creativity have an origin, and this origin is not in a logical sequence of steps: it is a quantum paradigm. Creativity can not be developed by a machine: The creativity comes normally in seconds, from deep areas of our mind. There is a reason for this: we can not be totally aware of the processes that lead to creativity, otherwise we would block it with our logic.
