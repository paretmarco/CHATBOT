This part of the course will teach you how to use trance states to alter the reality of a person and have them react in an unconscious way. We use only non-verbal communication, a few words, and obviously the power of the mind for this practice. It is a discipline that is very impressive not only to the client, but also to the practitioner, as we will show you how to do some amazing things during the training.
