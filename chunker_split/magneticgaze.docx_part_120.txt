Let us now make mention of some practical exercises wherein fascination is conjoined to hypnosis. The first such exercise might be carried out before any one else. It is also given the name of “establishing a contact on the subject”. [55] Exercise 39 Keep standing up in front of the subject who is seated, and look at his eyes fixedly and yet with sweetness: Your feet will have to graze his, and your knees will have to touch his. You will hold his wrists with your hands. Eventually, your will has to turn active: «I establish my ascendancy on this person, I saturate him with my only influence; I want him to perceive my influence distinctly; he will have to obey my injunctions, etc». It is not a case of whispering these formulas, which have nothing intrinsically «Kabbalistic» about them, and which do not possess any power per se. Rather, it is an issue of forcibly exalting your spirit by representing to yourself whatever the words you have pronounced signify. Depict in your mind an image of the subject being pervaded by an irresistible hegemonic force.
