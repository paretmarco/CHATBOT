A problematic trance would occur it' I found myself slipping into a rapid depression as my wandering associations popped up painful memories from the past relationship (age regression), and I virtually stopped hearing or seeing my fr; and the environment in present time (negative auditory or v send hailucinations) as I became "lost" in my ruminations. In both cases I am * a trance, but in the former I can choose to move out of with it and alter it easily, while in the latter I become identified ' h ' of -. or contents.ld its Trance as a Continuum In the Eastern tradition we are seen as being trapped in "maya," the transient world of the mind. We identify with (and thus become) this transient inner world of thoughts, feelings, emotions. The entrapment comes not from the external sensate world per se, but from our identification with it and attachment to it. We identify with this feeling and that thought, we think we are no more than the bundle of sensations currently capturing our field of attention. These identifications and attachments create limitations which cause us much "suffering."
