Within the camp of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, for instance, Steve and Connireae Andreas mention the concept of “breaking through the threshold”. According to our way of looking at things, however, the vision they provide, while being valid, is marked by incompleteness, insofar as the process is interpreted by them as a form of “no longer recognizing the stimulus”. In cases of extreme concentration, that might be more correctly defined as “transcending the conceptualization of the stimulus”. [44] Cf. Rossi, Wolinsky and Milton Erickson. [45] The abovementioned classification is the one derived from that which was adopted by Stephen Wolinsky in “Trances People Live”. The latter, in turn, is drawn from the most fashionable forms of classification which are utilized when talk is made of hypnosis. [46] We cause our patient to shift from an intrapersonal trance (existing inside him) to an interpersonal trance (which he experience with us). [47] Such a trance might even be intentionally self-generated.
