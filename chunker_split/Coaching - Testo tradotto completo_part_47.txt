Normally, in fact, that is exactly how such a self is born: In the child, the self is born as a defence system on the strength of which he can journey across the sea of life and cultivate the illusion of having a few certainties. Subsequently to such an initial stage, however, that self has a tendency to take firm roots, forget the reason why it was originated into existence in the first place, and lose connection with the more global individualized essence of a human being, the inward being of the person. Whereas our essential inward being constantly remains the same, the external reality changes all the time. When the relationship that prevails between the intimate essential being and the self is broken, that is, when the external self is no longer in touch with the internal being, the external self will be merely ruled by the single moment, by contingencies, by ostensible needs. Problems might accordingly arise. Several men, although they are indefatigable workers, do not succeed in anything they do, because they shift this way or that way, and their present activity bears hardly any resemblance with the one they engaged in yesterday or will engage in tomorrow.
