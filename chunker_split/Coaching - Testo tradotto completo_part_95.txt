Sit down comfortably, and place one hand over the knee, keeping the hand close save for the middle finger, which you are going to stretch towards the thigh. Thereafter, raise and lower the finger slowly, for 10, 15, 20 times. The point behind the exercise is never to swerve one’s attention away from the oscillating finger. Such fully focused attention must then be developed further by carrying out this exercise for increasingly longer spans 27. Exercise 12 – Closed fists Sit down, and stretch your closed fists over the table. Thereafter, open one finger at a time, most slowly, while focusing your firm attention on the motion traced by your finger. You will then open the fingers of the one hand firstly and then those of the other one, and finally the corresponding fingers of both hands simultaneously, e.g. the two index fingers, the two middle fingers, the two ring fingers and so on. Let us repeat ourselves: In this exercise, as well as in all of them, the point is not to carry out the movement which is set out in its description.
