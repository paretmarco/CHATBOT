It can be said that Korsybski's structural differential is a diagram which represents how the nervous system selects out to create its own reality and organize what it views as chaos.11 What needs to be stressed again is that the "I" and the "observer" (to be discussed later) are also part of this natural neurological and sometimes dissociative process whereby the body (nervous system) creates a psychology as an attempt to continue its own survival. This helps us to answer the often asked question, "Why don't identities (psychology) change rapidly?" Because the psychology is the body's survival mechanism. In other words, the "I" (psychology) is a defense against the over or under stimulation of the body. Psychology's (the I's) emergence is an attempt to order and explain that deprivation or over-stimulation. Furthermore, the "I" (psychology) which tries to change the unwanted "I" (psychology) is also part of the same nervous system, hence "you" are trying to get rid of "yourself." This goes against the natural fight/fight survival mechanism of the nervous system and it will not let that happen. Why?
