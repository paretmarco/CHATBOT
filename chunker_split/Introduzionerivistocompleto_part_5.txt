A brain is capable of doing amazing things and the problem is that it is often not what it cannot learn but the fact that it learns too well and too quickly. For example, the risk of a single traumatic event is conditioning us for years; in other words, a single experience can leave an indelible trace. In reality, nevertheless, you can go further than simply freeing yourself of these automatic conditionings. Thus, our abilities can be taught to move towards a state which brings us satisfaction. OUR NEEDS AND WHERE TO FIND ADEQUATE RESOURCES If we ask various people, we will discover that their different needs are: the need to know themselves better and improve their relationship with themselves, the need to open themselves to others and to be understood, to have personal security, to be positive, to unblock themselves, to have self-confidence, etc… It is important to realize that everything necessary to satisfy these needs to be successful people is INSIDE US! What we are saying here is that NLP 3 and the other methods are opportunities to gain the right methodology to bring everything out. There’s only one person who can decide to start this journey: you. If you reflect on the phrase that “thought is the forefather of action”, you will arrive to the pleasant conclusion which says: “The quality of your life depends exclusively on you!” “Life can be a daring adventure or nothing!!!! !” (Helen Keller) WHAT IS NLP?
