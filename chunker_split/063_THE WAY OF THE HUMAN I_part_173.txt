Instead, they see a big-huge person. They are not in present time, they are in "past time" or in their imagination creating a body image. And so when someone has a trauma, not only do they have a thought process, an emotional process, and a biological process collapsing during the trauma, but they also have a past time body image confused with one in the present time. Each identity or ego state has a body image associated with it. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The image of your body is not your body. For example, when someone is in a car accident and they are afraid to drive, it is because they are in their past time body image. Their body image is frozen and hence is unknowingly experienced as the same as when they were in the accident. In Quantum Psychology, you want to separate WHO YOU ARE from who you think you are. In this way, go beyond body images because you cannot experience present time if body images from the past are fused (associated with the present). At the thinking dimension, you not only have beliefs and thoughts, but you also have images.
