Milton Erickson illustrated many therapeutic metaphors in his book My Voice Will Accompany You that were able to provoke such changes in the readers whom they left surprised. The objective of the metaphor consists in changing the way in which we face our problems...... IT ISN’T THE KEY, BUT IT’S A WAY TO TURN THE KEY!!!! SOME EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE METAPHORS The garden of life “Imagine that you are in a garden, the garden of your life; there are some dead leaves dotted around the ground, all your worries are written on them; start to collect them, now burn them and scatter the ashes!” The lake “Imagine that you are at the bottom of a lake, the lake is your imagination; put every thought that you create in your head in a bubble and let it float to the top”. TIME LINE The River Metaphor If we dirty the water in a particular place, the whole river will be polluted, let’s go back and stop the river being polluted!!!!!! The Time Line technique is very efficient in resolving many problems and for personal improvement. The Time Line represents a metaphor on the basis that a person may reorganise his/ her memory and his/ her way of reacting in the present.
