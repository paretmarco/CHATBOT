It is also important to note that there is developmental arrest in this state and role-relationship model, such that the individual feels herself to be dependent, in need of supplies, and in need of an all-gratifying caretaker as would a small child. In this repressed state, the individual experiences these archaic feelings irrespective of the degree of adult autonomy she may have really attained.

The child sees the mother as a transformational figure, meeting needs, handling hunger, cold, or loneliness.
