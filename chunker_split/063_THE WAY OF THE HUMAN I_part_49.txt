* Quantum Psychology knows that to go beyond your psychology and stabilize awareness in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., you might first have to own your psychology before you can un-own it. You first have .to be willing to BE it ("your" psychology) before "you" can UN-BE it. And you must be willing to have it ("your") psychology) before you can un-have it. Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, "In order to let go of something you must first know what it is." Quantum Psychology says, "In order to let go of something, you must first be willing to experience it." You also have to know and acknowledge "your" concepts so that you can then take them apart and go beyond them. Ram Dass used to say, "In order to get out of a jail your must first know you are in one."
