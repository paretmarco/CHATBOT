Below is another demonstration to look at theArchetype I Regarding this Archetypical concept called I AM, etc., does it belong to anyone at all? It belongs to itself but not necessarily to anyone in particular. If the Archetypical concept of I AM-I AM NOT is thinned-out, what, if anything, occurs? . . . (Silence.) It feels prior to anything like falling. NOTHING. This is a real. Nisargadatta Maharaj question, "How did you get the idea that the I AM-I AM NOT was you?" It was not "my" idea. The idea came from "what" or "where?" It is an idea, and it is NOT. Does the concept of I AM-1 AM NOT have the idea of ownership, location etc.? It's all thoughts. So, it has nothing to do with anything? . (Silence.) Yeah. ________________ DEMONSTRATION #7 THE I AM Define the I AM It is what is and I AM What assumptions have you made about this IS- I AM That the IS is and I AM is what Is.
