DEMONSTRATION #4 Wolinsky:Define Dark matter (this "something" that you somehow know is there but you don't know what it is). ________________ Wolinsky: Bob: Wolinsky: Bob: ________________ Regarding the eternal seeker what has the Archetype done to itself looking for the eternal soup. It suggested the concept of a me which is not complete. Where in this body do you feel this Archetypical concept of a "me" which is not complete? In the chest. Put an image of the Archetype over there (another location in the room). And now take'the label off of the concept, called the "me" which is not complete in your chest. Have it as energy and allow it to go back to the Archetype. NOW Regarding this whole eternal search and eternal seeker who searches but never gets there but is always searching. Wherever you feel this, take the label off. Let it go back to the Archetype. ________________ Therapeutic Note Here we see how the Archetype can only re-enforce itself by coming up with Archetypical techniques. Anywhere in that body where you experience this tendency to learn techniques and methods, take the label off, give it back to the Archetype.
