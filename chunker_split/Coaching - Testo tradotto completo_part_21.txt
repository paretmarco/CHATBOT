Physiology Our essential being is other than our brain: It consists in the entirety of our being. That is why bodily or general relaxation methodologies are profoundly useful to the purpose of establishing contact with it. Drawing attention to the navel is another way of helping the process of centralizing oneself. In this regard, we might conceive man as having two minds: One mind which is represented by our “enteric brain”, which is situated in the nervous plexuses at the level of the navel, and which is linked to our deepest responses. At the level of our stomach there is in fact a second mind, which is responsible for hereditary reactions, digestion and a large part of physiology. It is no coincidence then, that when we feel an irritation precisely in that area we experience discomfort and stomach ache. Gastritis is frequently connected to an essential inward being which is not sufficiently recognized … C) Consciousness of time and being present to oneself Being present to our own selves and to time. If infinite time was available to us, it might be found that discrepancies between man and man would be erased.
