You have to delineate your goal in a very clear way, and then, in the event that you taste success, you must continue to act as if nothing had happened, without abandoning yourself, precisely at that stage, to more hazardous initiatives based on your trust in “good luck” or in your belief of “having hit upon the right formula”, since any such more thoughtlessly bold steps would eventually convoy you to the risk of failure. “Dissociation” in traders In the field of psychology, the dissociated person is the one who takes excessive shelter in analytical reasoning as a means for him to live out life. By doing so, he fails to live. This state is often the consequence of events which are emotionally charged. Some traders which have suffered setbacks might adopt this attitude of dissociation by using analogy, and thus run away from their trading activity. These individuals are afraid of trading and take shelter in reasoning. They turn hyper-analytical and know everything about how to do doing things properly, save that they do not jump into action. They essentially disengage themselves from reality, and step into an abstract world of thinking.
