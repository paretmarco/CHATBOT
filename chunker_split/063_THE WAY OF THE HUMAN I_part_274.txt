If I attempt through therapy or spiritual practice to solve my pain and its false "cause," I can only get a solution based on a False Conclusion because the cause or reason for the problem is False. This is why psychology and spirituality continue to fail in the "world" (see Volume II) False Conclusions-False Solutions no satisfaction. A predominant biological False Core is "no control." It is expressed because the nervous system is overstimulated. This forces the newer brain to come up with a reason for this experience and it comes up with the idea, "I am out of control." The animal appears to have no control because the externals (mom, dad, society) are trying to control it (i.e., eating, sleeping, excretion, sexuality, etc.) during 168 Chapter VIII the "socialization" process. The externals (morn/dad society) get internalized to form the superego which you fuse with and think is you. These internalizations try to control these animal instincts. As mentioned earlier, age regressed philosophies, stories, spirituality, and psychology, are going to justify the controlling of the animal.
