"I" has a concept called my body. Okay, like it's mine. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the concept of "I" has about the concept of mine. Jealously, envy. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the concept of "I" has about the concept of mine. The I has this concept that one can conquer (cre- ate), one can dictate outside, inside, boundaries Chapter IV that one can dominate, one can exploit, one can destroy. Those are interesting ideas. So, now again, notice this, well, you probably can't not notice this. There is no noticing. Okay, well, let's just chill out here then. You know that that mine thing is just attached to "I", which is nothing anyway. Is that an assumption of mine? Uhm. That's simply a condensation. So be THAT. I can't not be THAT. So don't not be THAT. That's not possible. (Long silence) Notice the VOID behind your eyes. Notice the VOID behind your sense of smell. Notice the VOID behind your feeling.
