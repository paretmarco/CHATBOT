In the field of personal relationships: As stated by Guido Cavalcanti: I received a very courteous answer from the lady who had earlier made fun of me She said: “The woman who in your heart did place with the strength of love her entire face inside your eyes had stared at you so firmly, that Love she then caused to appear" 98. Those who especially desire to fascinate a person of the opposite sex might act in the following fashion: When you come into contact with the person whose trust you would like to gain, try before anything else to be present (Refer in this connection to the exercises set out in the first part of this book). When you address words to her, look at her by the base of her nose and, at the same time, formulate such thoughts as: «You find me pleasing: I am a likeable person, and you are obliged to love me — you will have desire for me”, and similar phrases which will have to be adapted to every specific case. Remind yourselves of the fact that nothing can be transmitted, unless you yourselves are feeling it in the first place.
