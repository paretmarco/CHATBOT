Your conclusion is similar. You both march off to separate rooms, stewing in a trance that indeed creates the rest of the day (pseudo-orientation in time to the future) as being ruined in present time. At last you both get bored by the stalemate and begin to talk things through. As the anger dissipates and sweet feelings arise, the love trance glides into motion. Your mutual age regressions of the tantrum phase now transform into the age regression of the pow- erless, dependent, grateful child phase. You both slip into baby-talk as you apologize, telling each other, "I love you," and proclaiming that, "You're the only person in the world for me," or, "I would be devastated without you," or "I'm more myself with you than with anyone else in the world" (posthypnotic suggestions).
