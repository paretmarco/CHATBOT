THE PURPOSE Quantum Psychology is different from other forms of modem-day psychology because it has a different purpose, namely, to discover WHO YOU ARE. This is done by taking apart your False Core-False Self (Volume II) and developing multi-dimensional awareness (Volume I). Unlike most forms of psychotherapy, it is not intended to make you "better," "more virtuous" or teach you how to have great relationships, or how to make more money, or even how to feel more comfortable in your life. Rather, it is ultimately about the discovery of WHO YOU ARE. The vehicle used for the focus of Volume I is the Development of Multi-Dimensional Awareness which is the awareness of eight dimensions or manifestations of our Human Nature. This awareness might represent a stage or an integral part of this process. Nisargadatta Maharaj was the teacher "I" took as "mine" and worked with in India where I lived for almost six years. According to him, "The only way to find out who you are is to find out who you are not." This is Maharaj's first and most basic principle: "Anything that you think you are, you are not."
