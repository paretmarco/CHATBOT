Such a question might seem to be strange. Let us therefore hasten at once to elucidate its very important meaning. Every situation in our life is the product of a particular manner in which we relate to time. 1. Knowing what one wants. – One often thinks he knows what he actually wants, and yet his ideal is too imprecise or fluctuating, or else it does not conform to his real being. Other people go even as far as to confuse “wanting” with “desiring”. One cannot set his look on something devoid of a body, for otherwise the result would be null. We should consider that wanting entails for us an action. We must therefore get used to capture what we want to will in some picture which embodies it concretely. 2. The possibility of accomplishing what one wants. – It is useless to will something impossible: Our very being will be alert to such impossibility, by refusing to produce an effort it already knows to be futile. Put it in other words, our unconscious would spontaneously tend to debar us from wasting energy in vain. Willing is only based on having the capacity to do.
