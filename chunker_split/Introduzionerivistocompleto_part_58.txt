This is only one example to let you understand how NLP is different from that of traditional psychoanalyses, a fact that cannot be questioned. However, if you had to achieve an internal re-harmonizing objective or overcome a problem and you had to choose between two paths (one which was shorter and easier the other longer and sometimes with signs that often told you to turn back and start your sometimes torturous and painful journey again), which would you choose? Just think that during a psychotherapy session where NLP techniques are applied, you do not need to tell your life story or whatever it was that brought you to have the problem or block in the first place. It is important to understand what it is that we want to free ourselves from or the behavior we want to change and act on. It is not important to dig around in the past looking for the cause of the behavior we want to change. It is a waste of energy that can be instead put to work in a constructive way by ourselves. Obviously all these techniques are only successful when the person has the will to give up his old behavior and replace it with s more constructive one that s/he chooses. “Man was born to live, not to prepare himself to live”. (Boris Pasternàk) Once you have acquired the technique, you will be able to feel in total control of your life, even when you find yourself faced with resolving one of your problems.
