This phenomenon of "correlation" (to use a quantum term) binds fascination too, or rather the connection to another person through the eyes. With this type of direct technique an imagination of heat in one hand reflects in the person who looks at us, a feeling of scratchiness equally, and so forth. However, if this has to happen without talking, in excess of having a very much evolved imagination, you must accompany it with energy exercises. But these are results of «top school».
