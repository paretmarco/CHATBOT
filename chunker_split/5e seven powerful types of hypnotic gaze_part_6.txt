On a more subtle level, staring is a way to open a channel to transmit your energy. This energy is what is called "lifeforce". It is what the indians calls "the kundalini-power" and the greeks "the power of the hermetic caducy". Even if everybody already possesses a part of this energy and you can get good results from the begin, proper practice is useful to release more and reach the results of Virgilio or Donato. - Developing our central gaze: going beyond the centre of personality As your eyes become stronger, the next step is practising what is called "the central gaze". This is the most known of all hypnotic gazes. You look steadily at the centre of eyebrows, at what the Indians call the Ajna Chakra. Your partner will not understand in which eye you are looking at, and at the same time he/she feels the gaze as a sort of power exerted towards him. This gaze has a powerful impact and it will transmit the idea of force and strength. This kind of staring is also the basis for many energetic transmissions and esoteric initiations.
