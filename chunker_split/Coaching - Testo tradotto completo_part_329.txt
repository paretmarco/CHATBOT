Being however a witness of one's own acting leads one to transcend timidity and worry; nay, as far as the latter is concerned, this modus operandi is in actual fact the antithesis of preoccupation, and as such it enables one to function in a state of imperturbable calmness. This “natural” way of acting might of course be negative just as much as it might be positive. It might, in other terms, either be an aid to the active performance of useful actions or act as an inhibitor which prevents from undertaking harmful operations. In this respect, it might be no different from the art of education. The differentiating element between the two, however, lies in the fact that education is normative, and thus lies down precepts, whereas "acting naturally” is an unconscious occurrence. Whereas education proceeds from the outside inwardly, acting naturally moves in the opposite direction. It starts, that is, from the unconscious depths of our self in order to ultimately reach a goal which, while it is ours, consists in actual fact in an outer manifestation.
