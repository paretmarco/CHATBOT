We might call this whole a "totipotent whole", by drawing a comparison with the concept of "totipotence" which is used in the biology relating to stem cells that are capable of growing in every cell of the organism. White light is a "totipotent whole", inasmuch as it encompasses all the colours in its quantum superposition. What we name reality is purely the light that gets reflected on the different objects. Every visible object is already potentially present in the white light. Many experiences share the experience of light. When we observe light and, even more significantly, when we are able to discern or imagine white light even if our eyes are shut, we are drawing close to the â€œtotipotent field", which is in turn quite closely related to the concept of "quantum field". The ancient humans used to link to it such phenomena as, for example, clairvoyance. There are peoples, including the Pygmies in Africa or the Parsi, who, up until these days, gaze at the fire in order to draw inspiration from it.
