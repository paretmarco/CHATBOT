In love relationships, when one attempts to separate from another, the one being separated from tends to "put down" the other and make them into the anti-Christ (the one being left is the Christ). 234 Special Section I once had a client who said to me, "If the person I want doesn't want me, obviously they are assholes." This is because there is an age-regressed re-enactment of an incomplete earlier developmental process wherein they realized they were separate from mom. Johnson (1991) says it this way: Natural attempts at separation are blocked, causing parental anxiety, or are actively punished. At the same time, the child's natural abilities for empathic mirroring are overvalued and reinforced by parents who require merger with the child in order to feel secure or worthwhile. (p. 79) This explains the narcissistic,sounter-trance-ference of the guru, teacher or therapist who cannot allow their disciple or student to leave. Why? Because it brings up the separation problem the guru or teacher or therapist did not resolve with their parents. This is also why the guru reinforces and praises the false self that the disciple or student presents.
