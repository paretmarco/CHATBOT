The WITNESS it is not an "I" or a pattern, and neither exists nor not exists. It is aware of the BIG NOTHING "behind it," and maybe even an observer-observed dyad. It is aware and rests in between the I AM and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS "where" even the "NOT-I-I" and awareness itself disappear. DEMONSTRATION #1 This demonstration explores the NOT I-I Process. Wolinsky:What is EMPTINESS? Claudia:The emptiness is this dark, empty space and I feel alone, which I am. Therapeutic Note: Notice how the identity of "I am alone" is fused with the empty label and she assumes it is her, and I am. ________________ Chapter /V Take the label off, I just am. Now, if you fuse together the dark, empty label equals alone, what gets resisted? The vastness. It's like I am resisting this vast "Not I." Notice the vastness and in present time, right now, decide that it is not I and this alone concept is the I. Yeah. Do that again. Okay. That's very familiar. I don't like it. Do it again. Yeah.
