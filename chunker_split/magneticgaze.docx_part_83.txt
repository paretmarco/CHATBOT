The most effective therapeutic processes use that resource in an unconscious manner (by adding the healer as a resource). What simply occurs during the therapy based on the look is that such concept is made even more concrete via the recourse to the sensory faculty of sight. An undoubted efficacy is indeed ensconced in relating our problems to a third person, which is something that takes place in every type of therapeutic approach. What might nevertheless still happen is that the subject “sneaks out” mentally and detaches himself at the crucial moment. This is something which often materializes through pensive reflection, the creation, that is, of one’s own mental thoughts. It has a physiological correspondence in the motions of the eye. When we step inside our thoughts, in fact, we perform certain movements of the pupils in specific directions, whereas, in other cases, we de-focalize. [42] Neuro-Linguistic Programming, for instance, notices that when a person bends his pupils toward the top left side, he is often accessing constructed images, whereas, if he performs that motion to his left, he is accessing some reiterated patterns.
