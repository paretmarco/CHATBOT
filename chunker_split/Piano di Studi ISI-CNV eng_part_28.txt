Our Quantum Psi technology applied to coaching is able to effectively treat the behaviors "quantum" that is, the manifestations of the mind resulting from processes that are normally completely unconscious. These are processes that can never become conscious without being distorted. As long as a process is in fact our unconscious the brain work more effectively because it can use the quantum mode, following several lines of reasoning at the same time and creating mental associations. The reasoning is unconscious, however, different from the traditional way: at this point it is necessary to use a quantum paradigm to treat this type of information that appears on a conscious level exclusively expressed by symbols or feelings. Quantum mechanics is a modern discipline and effective to create models and predictions controllable quantum behavior. Can you give us helpful hints on how long elaboration on what to do in case of need, etc.. The quantum process allows us to understand what is behind the genius. The brilliant idea sometimes comes in milliseconds. Our individualistic self, consisting as it does of habits, is seldom capable of fully understanding the infinite range of answers which life might provide. It is therefore necessary to open up one's vision and have recourse to intuition, to a higher sense which is not merely grounded on logic, but is rather based on an array of different evaluations which can only be made unconsciously.
