An in all, her treatment spanned six months of intensive work. Although many kinds of treatment interventions were used in working with her symptom of alcoholism, the critical one was interrupting and altering the deep trance patterns of negative hallucination and age regression. I should mention that I require clients who are drug- and alcohol-addicted to participate in some twelve-step program while they are also working in therapy. Attending these groups helps to remove denial (amnesia), to create additional awareness of the addictive issues, and, of course, provide a network of support. By asking clients to describe their symptoms while breathing and looking at me, I interrupt the self-to-self trance of the symptom by placing them (via eye contact) in a self-to-other trance with me. This changes the context in which the symptom occurs and adds the therapist as a resource in present time. (This is a common technique in Gestalt therapy and was demonstrated to me in 1975 by Eric Marcus, M.D., and Jack Rosenberg, Ph.D.) Erickson has pointed out that the adult in present time has resources that the traumatized child did not have.
