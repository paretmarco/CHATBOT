The adult had become the age-regressed inner child. The observer had created this illusioning as a child because her home life had been intolerable. This is how she protected herself. In other examples of illusioning, people imagine a Cinderella story in which some millionaire will marry them and take them away from all this, take care of them, give them everything they need, give them undying illusioning â€¢ 85 love, attention, etc. People also envision being President, a baseball star, football hero, or a movie star. This ability to create illusions is how children remove themselves and disperse the reality of family experiences. Case I explained: The client who created the illusion of being like Christ did so to help her survive as a child. The child' s illusion might have simply ended. She might have switched to an illusion of herself as a school teacher. But these patterns of illusioning and futurizing often escalate, making the illusions solid. Hence, as an adult, the child within the woman experiences beings or guides coming to her. She is unable to sleep at night. She is waiting for the prophecies to come true. The illusions developed in childhood had become very strong.
