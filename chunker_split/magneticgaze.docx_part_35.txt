The rotation of the look This exercise ought to be carried out in some open space by the countryside, or else in a place boasting a vast horizon. As you unflinchingly keep your head motionless, you should then begin, starting from either a real or an imaginary point in front of you, to trace with your look a gradually expanding spiral, until you are eventually able to encompass the largest possible portion of earth and sky, to your right and to your left, above and below you. Once you have accomplished that, you should move back to the central point and then begin to trace a new spiral, though in an opposite direction compared to the first one. We can discern that all the exercises requiring us to move the pupil of the eye possess a mental benefit alongside their mental usefulness. The different positions of the eye, in fact, tend to correspond to different points of access to the brain. [25] By motioning the eyes in every direction, we accordingly confer on the brain a global stimulation. Exercise 12.
