For example, if it is an experience of sadness, for example, take the label off of sadness and have it as energy. Next, take off the label of energy (since energy too is a label). Then notice and dive into the vast NOTHINGNESS of the "NOT-I-I" and pure awareness. THE TENDENCIES OF THE VOID The NOT-I-I is the last touchstone before awareness, and the awarER disappears. Upon the contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS certain "tendencies" or characteristics seem to predominant as the "I" begins to solidify. The mind (condensed VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CON- 152 Chapter IV SCIOUSNESS) is organized around believing in time and in the future. These are major constructs which organize and solidify the mind. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The VOID contracts to become the mind. But in the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS there is no future. The mind (condensed VOID) resists this and creates an idea of future. Time is involved in the entire construction of the mind, or the individual "I". But, again, in the "NOT-I-I" there is neither past, present nor future.
