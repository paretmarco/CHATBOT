If a thought comes by that says, "I don't understand," you identify with it and then begin a chain of associations like "I don't understand," "I never understood anything," "This is my story." But anything you identify yourself with as "I" will limit you. The nature of the mind is to always change its mind; that's why one minute you like your job, the next you don't. One minute you like your relationship, the next you don't. One day you're really happy with the course of your life, the next day you're not. If you fall in love today, tomorrow you won't like the person so much. Therefore, you can't depend on your thoughts. And so there is no answer to the question, "From where does this thought arise." But notice what happens if you ask that question 86 Chapter VI and look for the space from which each thought arises The thing to remember isâ€”who is the knower of "your" thoughts (to be discussed in Volume III). I once worked with a married couple in a workshop.
