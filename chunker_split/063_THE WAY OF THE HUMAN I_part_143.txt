This approach asks the practWoner to do precisely this technique of self-remembering: To focus on the thinking dimension (inside) and the external world (outside), simultaneously, and in a balanced way. Ultimately in Quantum Psychology, we will later ask much more, i.e., to focus on three or more dimensions simultaneously. The thinking world contains our beliefs, trances, assumptions, decisions, and values at a thinking level. It comprises not only what we think _and believe, but also the world of images. For example, imagine you are sitting and all of a sudden you have an image of the beach, or you have an image of the mountains, or you have an image of the relationship that you want, or you have an image of your mother, or your father, or a past event, or a future eventâ€”all those different images are part of the thinking world. Of course, emotions are involved and connected with beliefs, but as we see the levels, we realize that they have different functions. Unfortunately, we often favor one dimension of reality over another.
