When people asked her a question, she always said "The body thinks or the mind thinks," rather than "I think." The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #4 Focus: Each time a thought arises ask, "Where does that thought subside to?" This teaching is from Ramana Maharshi, the 20th century sage and teacher of self-enquiry. A thought arises and subsides: notice where that thought subsides. Is there is an answer to this question?
