It is an effortless and pure energy pouring out of the body's tissues by which "I" feel a oneness with the "external." It is the loss of the awareness of, and disconnection from, the BIOLOGICAL CORE which causes a disconnection from the external world. In other words, the muscles of the body are disorganized and fight one another. This is mirrored in the psychology where parts of "yourself' are fighting one another. The energy is drained and there is a defense of the trauma of separation and loss of the BIOLOGICAL CORE. To illustrate this, I use the metaphor of Alfred Schatz, founder of the Institute for Applied Physiology in Germany: Imagine a symphony orchestra where the instruments are all out-of-tune, not playing together, and on different beats. There is a conflict going on. But if the conductor can get all the instruments organized so that they're playing the same music and are orchestrated 146 Chapter VIII at the same time—rhyme, rhythm and beat, etc.—there is no fighting and it's a beautiful experience. The same is true with the brain (the conductor).
