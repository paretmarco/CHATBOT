When your Awareness is freed up, then ESSENCE, I AM, "NOT-I-I," etc. emerge naturally. You can't work *As will be discussed in Volume HI, all spiritual practise requires an Ito do it. 23 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness In Quantum Psychology you cannot transcend anything if you are unwilling to experience and acknowledge it. For this reason we spell transcend, Trance-end, the ending of trances. Transcendence by mantra, yantra or tantra is temporary; it is a temporary "high" or "hit." Somebody can achieve it for a short while if they are secluded in a retreat, workshop or Ashram. But put them on the job or in a relationship and the "uncooked seeds" (to be discussed later) sprout again. This is because each new or different external context brings up "different" uncooked seeds. If your awareness of ESSENCE, I AM, etc. has to be guarded (by rules and shoulds), protected (by not associating or associating only with certain people) or by isolation (retreats, Ashram, etc. ), this is not Enlightenment.
