At the request of the queen of Belgium I gave a stance at the Theatre d'Ostende on the nth of August 1887 at which all the court assisted. I had asked the commander of the marine school to bring me about twenty cabin boys with whom I might experiment, to put aside all suspicion of trickery. That night I invented complicated scenes of fishing, swimming, navigation and shipwreck. When I fascinated lawyers, as in Milan, Gaud and Douai, I made them deliver political speeches, or I composed a tribunal with judges, public accusers, defendants, etc. In Yassy (Romania) the judge was easily found, since I fascinated the president of the tribunal in the presence of Queen Natalie of Servia. Experiments have also been suggested to me by antithesis. It was thus that in 1882 in Paris it occurred to me to make Prince Louis Murat wait upon me, having transformed him into a man servant by the force of my will. And again I obliged Count Maurice Fleury, son of General Fleury, a gentle young man, reserved and timid, to dance a wild can-can before his astonished friends.
