You ought to train yourselves to put your entire thought in a single action and prevent this thought from getting dispersed in something else. You should also train yourselves to direct the full reservoir of your energies to your own speech as you talk, to your particular ability when you are engaging in some manual undertaking, to your voice when you are singing, to your fingers when you will require from them the accomplishment of some delicate work, to all your organs and all the functions of your being which you might get the chance of putting into effect. Whoever wants to have an idea of the power if thought, for instance the power it exercises on organic functions, he should try, immediately upon finishing his lunch, to lie down on a couch and let the following sentence ring in his mind: “I have a good digestion. I digest perfectly”. Let him try and see with the eyes of his mind, without ever deflecting such thought, his stomach at the stage when the gastric juices dent the food that has been ingested a short while earlier, and are converging to it, when it carries out its peristaltic movements, when the kilogram of food moves into the intestine, etc.
