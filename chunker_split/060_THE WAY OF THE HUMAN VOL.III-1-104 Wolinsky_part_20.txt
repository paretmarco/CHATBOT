How are you doing? I feel this space of my Essential Core. It is amazing. DEMONSTRATION #2 I am also having a problem with this. Notice your False Core. And notice all the energy which that False Core has. Notice the different chains of association that come off the False Core. Now, notice the BIG EMPTINESS the False Core is floating in. Now, ask the False Core, "What is it that you are seeking more than anything else in the world." What does it say? It disappeared. Okay, let's stay with that. So what I am going to ask you to do as we go on is to pay attention to the experience that emerges rather then doing any figuring out. Just notice what emerges as we continue. So now if it disappeared, what would that feellike? I just get this peachy pink color. What does that feel like? It feels okay. So ask the False Core, what is it that you seek by disappearance. If it were to disappear and be peachy, what would that feel like? Nothing. And what does that feel like? Notice your experience that is emerging.
