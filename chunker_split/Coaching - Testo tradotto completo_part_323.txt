The same thing is going to apply to one’s relationships with other people. Human contact is a natural activity, and the greater our ability to lean on our unconscious, the better will be the results we are ultimately going to harvest. You should for instance know how to draw back during exchanges of opinion and thus create silence within yourselves. These moments will be used so as to stay in touch with a state of inner harmony as well as harmony with one's interlocutors over and above the said mutually divergent opinions. We will then display what is termed “spontaneity”. Besides, that will consist in a natural and educated form of spontaneity, insofar as it will be also linked to an enduring desire to have a relationship with the other. In that manner, we will know how to express ourselves, without asking ourselves such useless questions as to whether we are being the dominant force or the one that is being dominated. We will be rather focusing on the purpose of the encounter with such other person.
