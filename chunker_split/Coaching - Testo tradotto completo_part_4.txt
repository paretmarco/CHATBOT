One of the dimensions in respect of which our attitude matters is the temporal dimension, the one which relates to time. Time is a dimension in physics, and it is so in human life as well. It is an omnipresent factor, which everyone possesses but only few understand. It is, moreover, the first capital asset which any individual owns. It is the true mystery one has to pierce in order to understand how we should guide our vital force during the process of practical actualization. It is the secret lever for attaining whatever we desire. Every person is endowed with the same measure of this capital asset, though only a tiny elite of men is capable of exploiting it fruitfully. A clear-cut process to reach that goal exists. Whoever is successful, whoever achieves gratification in life, has understood it, possibly on an unconscious basis, and consequently develops his talents in conformity with that process. As for the one who fails to comprehend it, he will always remain unhappy. If we manage to understand this key, however, success will be shown to be far easier than what several people believe.
