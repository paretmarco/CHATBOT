Preface Can we not see that a stronger force is exercised by the human eyes which, through a mere look, almost bring about life or death, cause blood to flow away and come back, wrest away strength and restitute it, and, even more remarkably, corrupt the judgment of human minds” (Sonnet by Lorenzo de’ Medici, known as “Il Magnifico” [1]) Who would not like to prove attractive and to fascinate? To «fascinate» bears the connotation of “producing a spellbinding effect or enchanting through one’s look or speech”. The present book is devoted to the power of the eye and the secrets which are correlated to it. By means of this organ, in fact, astonishing results can be achieved. The influence exercised by man over another member of the species is no doubt the product of a multiplicity of causes, yet no one of those underlying causes is comparable, in terms of its potency, to the one possessed by the look.
