THE SEPARATION MYTH Many religions are based on a myth or story of separation, that something happened, such as Eve and Adam eating the apple, and suddenly human beings were separated from God. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, this myth is not an Archetype but rather a spiritualization to defend against the shock of the Realization of Separation from the mother. Mother is spiritualized and turned into God. The False Core gives the reason for separation (original sin) and is thus created as way to organize with the separation from God/ Mom, i.e., if I have a reason as to why it occurred I can be in control by imagining overcoming the reason overcomes the chaos." US 139 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology This being born with or into original sin and then thrown out of the kingdom of God is a spiritualized metaphor for the natural shock of the Realization of Separation and the creation of the False Core to explain the reason why we go through this process. Is the process universal? Yes. But is it Archetypical? No.
