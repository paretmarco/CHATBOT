Indeed, in the spine, they meet symbolically three ducts called Sympathetic, Vagus and Central corresponding to those Yogi calls Ida, Pingala and Sushunna. Ida and Pingala are the left and right side respectively. When their energies meet then you can develop the core energy. Under other latitudes, the concept expresses in all systems, for example in the cabal, we have a central pillar and two side pillars. If we look at this from a neurological point of view, we may think that the liberation of the core energy is tied to a particular interaction between the two halves of the body, each corresponding to a cerebral hemisphere. The man is in fact, except for some organs, completely symmetrical, and the most recent neurological studies coincide in fact to observe that in humans there are two hemispheres each one with its own specialization. Virtually it is as if we had two brains to govern our body. For the development of inner power one has to ensure that these operate in a consistent manner. In order to have this happen, primarily the spine must be aligned. Since this concept is linked also to the vertical, to the meeting between Earth and sky, expressing us symbolically, it also follows that more a person is, as they say with modern term "grounded", with her feet on the ground, the more can be a fascinator. Let us start with some simples Exercise 24: grounding. Bring attention to your vertical and the weight of your body to Earth. Continue in this attention, marching.
