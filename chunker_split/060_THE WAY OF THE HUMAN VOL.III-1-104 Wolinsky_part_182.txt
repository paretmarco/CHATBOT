Not MY mind but THE MIND. Everything you know comes out of the mind, because you wouldn't know if you were happy or sad, or felt good or bad, or liked someone or didn'tâ€”if there weren't something in your mind telling you so. When a thought conies through your awareness and tells you that you like someone or hate someone or that you feel good or bad, ask yourself, "Who told me that?" Then answer "The mind" (i.e., condensed VOID). The purpose of this exercise is to become clear that it is the mind. The mind tells you that you feel good and you believe it, or you feel bad and you believe it. There is nothing personal about it. It is the mind (condensed VOID). It is the nature of the mind to always change its mind. It is your nature to be what you are and the mind's nature to be what it is. It is not personal because the "I" or knower of the mind is part of the mind itself. Once this is "gotten" the "I" or knower of the mind disappears and there is NOTHINGNESS.
