Exercise 33: Mental suggestions Concentrate on your own image while in front of a mirror, and simultaneously impart some mental suggestions to your own self (‘come forward’, ‘move backward’, ‘the arm is lifting up’, etc.). You then realize that you will come to reply to yourselves unconsciously. Exercise 34: Positive suggestions Carry out the two immediately preceding exercises (i.e. simple self-fascination and “mental suggestions”). Thereafter, in front of a mirror, and after implementing the two previous exercises, you should impart to yourselves a series of positive suggestions. It is important that, as you put this sequence of exercises into effect, you should adopt the suitable kind of “mental voice”. You must be direct and commanding, and the tone of your voice ought to ooze confidence. If you so wish, you might make use of the following exercise in order to improve the tone of your voice.
