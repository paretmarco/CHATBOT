When this occurs, new belief systems and philosophies spring up into being. One day when I was in India, "I" experienced my arm as being made of the same substance as a tree. "I" realized that my thoughts were made of the same substance as the earth beneath me. But this experience did not remain stabilized. At first your identities are foreground while ESSENCE-I AM, etc., are very much in the background. At some point, this shifts and ESSENCE-I AM, etc., moves forward while the fixated awareness of the False Core loosens and recedes. When this happens, you lose interest in and go beyond "your" psychology which you soon realize is simply a lens by which the imagined self and world were viewed. At this point, the False Core Driver and False Core Compensator move into the background or just disappear. Finally, THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and the "NOT-I-I" are clearer and are now foreground, and THAT is what "you" are living in. GUIDED EXERCISE: YOUR ESSENTIAL CORE Eyes closed.
