This is useful in that to affirm something means to halt any doubts or mistrusts you may have. Create inside yourself the feeling that what you want is real and can be achieved just by wanting it. A desire or a situation to be achieved can come back to you even during different times of the day; this means that the condition becomes part of your life. “Fantasy is your power”. RULES FOR COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND You should keep in mind that you are communicating with your unconscious mind, therefore, it is necessary to respect the rules, until our mind listens and understands what we want. USE THE PRESENT When you think about the result, think of it as already accomplished. The unconscious mind is an existential mind and works in the “moment”, for the future does not exist for it. BE POSITIVE Eliminate all negative words, for to transmit negation of something within communication means to transmit badly. For your subconscious “no” and “not” are neutral words. Normally, we are used to talking about what we want, eliminating without realising the reinforcement of the problem. Say where you want to go and not where you want to leave. BE SIMPLE Choose a specific area where you can put the improvement into effect. BE DETAILED Analyse your objective and structure your suggestion in such a way as to include every detail of your new behaviour in a positive plan. For example, if you are scared to speak in public, the suggestion would be, “I like speaking to people”.
