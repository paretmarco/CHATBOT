The first thing we will have to learn is that we cannot possibly know the future, and that no one is able to foretell how, when, and at which ruling price a certain stock or currency might sell. In the domain of finance and financial information, we can lay our hands on whatever predictions we are looking for, concerning any possible kind of market whatsoever. There are some people who, in order to decide how they are going to invest the savings and in which market specifically they are going to do so, rely with confidence on information they might receive from friends, acquaintances, bank employees or brokers, or on information they have gleaned from articles written by analysts and published in magazines devoted to financial issues. Every person has his own subjective viewpoint and ideas on the markets, yet no one possesses the power of knowing beforehand what shall unfold itself. In some instances, it might possibly happen that the advices one receives actually yield a positive result. It is likewise possible that the opposite takes place, whereupon oneâ€™s investments fail to match expectations. Unlike other types of entrepreneurial activities, the trader must make immediate decisions.
