NLP 3 is the outcome of many years of modeling. The modeled people used effective communication models and all had succes in their lifes; most of them knew already traditional NLP, but judged it “too slow” or “unhuman” and they then had developed models that didn’t enter in the traditional NLP schemes. The analysis started from the fact that NLP is a methodology, not a technique. We have then examined the operational models of such people and we have discovered that they all operated a different manner of analysis of reality. It means they operated at a different logical levels compared to the traditional schools of NLP: they —unconsciously— used NLP 3. What does NLP 3 offer me ? Emphasis in NLP 3 doesn’t fall on DOING Neurolinguistic Programming, instead it falls on learning to BE a Neurolinguistic Programmer. Our way of teaching NLP has been renewed, bringing the student to interiorize a serie of microabilities that lead to a superior awareness of the various processes in action. Emphasis has been set on the integration of the various techniques of NLP for an easy implementation of them in a wider operative context (Sale, Negotiation, Therapy, Relations, Personal Development, etc.).
