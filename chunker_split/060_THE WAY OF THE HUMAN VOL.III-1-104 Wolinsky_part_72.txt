Quantum Psychology is an attempt to include Nisargadatta Maharaj's basic principles in a Western context of living life, having relationships, holding down a job, etc. What "I" noticed was that the NON-VERBAL I AM often occurred in Nisargadatta Maharaj's presence. However when "I" went back into the world and had relationships, etc., my "uncooked seeds" sprouted again.
