Maharaj's premise is that you start from I AM and use it as a pointer, understanding it is the seed of your personal consciousness. As I mentioned previously, the process of just being I AM and letting go of everything else while living in the world, having relationships, holding down a job, etc., was very difficult for this "me" and "I" imagine it is difficult for most people. For that reason, Quantum Psychology emerged to help this process and to stabilize awareness. When its theory is applied, it might help "you" to be established, stabilized and rest into your own presence without retreating from the world. It should also be noted that Quantum Psychology is not interested in changing maps or beliefs or in re-programming or substituting one set of beliefs for another. Actually, Quantum Psychology 76 Chapter dismantles psychology and spirituality. Oftentimes, Quantum Psychology does not, like psychology and oftentimes spirituality, lead to a "new" beliefs or frames of reference but rather to the I AM and Beyond; hence, NO FRAMES OF REFERENCE, NO REFERENCES TO FRAME.
