There remains the problem of the eclectic persons, of those versatile souls who are devoid of a single neatly demarcated tendency. One might possibly suggest to them to study the most favourable external conditions by seeking help from their unconscious. Many other considerations will have to be drawn into the effort of setting up a well thought-out plan: Both the relevant external considerations (the environment in which one lives, his family and social ties, his economic possibilities, and even the political regime under which his life takes place) and, with even greater force, the personal considerations of a physical as well as a spiritual nature 60. Commitment and pleasure The life plan thus examined and drawn up, will thus prove to be a plan of commitments and directions. These commitments will be pleasant because they reflect our own selves, yet such commitments will have to be echoed by another program, a corresponding program of pleasures acting as background and underpinning scope of our life. Our view tends to include within the list of pleasures even the pleasure of doing: The pleasing exercise of all our activities. We will thus have sensory and intellectual pleasures, economic, family-related and social ones.
