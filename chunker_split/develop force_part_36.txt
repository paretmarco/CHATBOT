Basic concepts The presence is a status of natural conscience, an enlarged perception compared to our concept of consciousness. It can also be defined as a status of "reintegration". Gurdjieff, many ancient alchemists, wise oriental Taoists, those who practice Yoga, and all of the esoteric traditions of all continents, they gather at the Summit on the concept of presence. Reintegration and Presence The presence is a gift essential to strengthen your fascinative force. Virtually, we do not leave anything out of us. In the practice, the first step is to develop the "know that we are there." If we are "present”, we are energetically denser in the situation. To develop such a gift, we have "to want” to become increasingly conscious of ourselves. We have to be "in things", not to live our life in our thoughts.
