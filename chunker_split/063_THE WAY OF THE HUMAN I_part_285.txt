Now, have the hood over there (another place in the room) and the primal energy over there (another place in the room). See them as an archetypical battle between two forces. 176 It feels like if I experience this primal energy then I will alienate my mother and I won't have anyone to take care of me, then I won't survive and I will die. 177 The Way of the Human Â® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Wolinsky:So if you fuse together this primal energy equals alienation of mom, what occurs? Therapeutic Note This fusion/unfusion process is demonstrated in the Tao of Chaos, Part #8. Terrible, I feel like it is dangerous to alienate mom. It was dangerous because if you alienate mom, then you won't survive. If you fuse together primal energy equals alienation of mom, what gets resisted? The energy itself. What was assumed, decided or believed that got you to resisting the energy itself? Same thing. Now if primal energy is separate from alienation of mom, they are separate issues, what occurs? A sense of the expansion and then immediate contraction.
