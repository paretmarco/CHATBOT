In quantum term we say we couls say we collapse the dimensions. But our techniques let go and create harmony that we feel as essence. Essence is our first perception of non verbal self beyond judgements. Here after the four elements we are at the pentalfa corresponding to the energy of the self at following line of the tetraktys. This line has 3 points = 3 elements of non-verbal self: 1: pure physical perception (the salt), 2 and 3 our staying in the world as observer (corresponding to alchemical sulphur) of an observed reality (corresponding to alchemical mercury). These 3 elements are the parts of our non verbal self. Technique to go further past observer observed brings connection to Universe. technique to do it: look yourself in the mirror where the observer is the observed, and breath to increaese energy. It creates also a parasympathetic reaction. It lets go the search and scan of the sympathetic nervous system and at the same way the observer observed reality. The hermetic marriage happens. This technique brings to a perception where the I doenst exist more.
