It is in fact the very opposite of stress. In that manner, we would be able to understand what the thought that we are living in the best of possible worlds truly means. The creation of a Power-related Coherence Field and the concept of time The time horizon for creating a coherence field is short (as it consists after all in a technique linked to presence, one where attention is focused on the now – it is in any event possible to think that time does not exist, and that the appraisal of things is rather moulded upon images one is conscious of). In order for us to be able to exercise such power, we must avoid being excessively steeped in reasoning. Phases of the action required in order to interact with a coherence field In order to exercise the power of the Coherence Field, more than one phase has to be traversed. These phases are technically defined as “terrains”. The “first terrain” is to have some antecedent grip over the person. What will surely prove to be useful in this initial phase are the linguistic techniques which are taught in order to establish communication with our fellow humans.
