This very same concept is also at the heart of Pribram and Bohm’s holonomic theory: "Every sense works like a lens, and thus refocuses the visual waves both by perceiving specific elements which are reiterated so as to establish an underpinning basis, and by perceiving distinct quantities. If we were to take the lenses off, only a hologram would be left”. Given that every sense works by refocusing in accordance with certain mechanisms, it is very difficult to regain access to the WHOLE. We might call this whole a "totipotent whole", by drawing a comparison with the concept of "totipotence" which is used in the biology relating to stem cells that are capable of growing in every cell of the organism. White light is a "totipotent whole", inasmuch as it encompasses all the colours in its quantum superposition. What we name reality is purely the light that gets reflected on the different objects. Every visible object is already potentially present in the white light. Many experiences share the experience of light. When we observe light and, even more significantly, when we are able to discern or imagine white light even if our eyes are shut, we are drawing close to the “totipotent field", which is in turn quite closely related to the concept of "quantum field".
