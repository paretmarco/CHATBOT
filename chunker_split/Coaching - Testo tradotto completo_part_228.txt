Became what you are (Pindar) Coordinating and subordinating The achievers are those who follow a vocation which originates in the depths of their beings, and which springs out of the observation of their harmonious balance with the Universe, with the result that they turn themselves into a reflection of it. Why? Because the vocation enables one to perceive the straight road ahead, which he is called upon to tread. Whoever, then, sacrifices everything to such vocation, will act almost as if in a state of somnambulism, his forces having been multiplied. In order, however, for this vocation to reach its ultimate goal, organization is required. Organizing your activity has the connotation of making profitable use of your energies. A waterfall fails to confer any strength unless and until the engineer has channelled it first. Put it differently, unless and until he organizes the power of the waterfall by directing it to a specific purpose. You must canalize your forces. Organizing bears the meaning of coordinating and subordinating. Coordinating: It is to lay activities in an orderly arrangement, in such a manner that not a single one of those activities gets forgotten or lost.
