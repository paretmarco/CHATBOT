It is, rather, to walk on the ground (Chinese proverb) Many traders assert that they desire to accomplish their objectives and that they are going to stick to a specific line for that purpose, and yet they subsequently allow themselves to be seized by the emotion of the moment, whereupon they start behaving as if they were playing. The truth of the matter is that, in actual fact, they only play with themselves. In order to function properly, it is imperative to be present, and to be in the here and now. In the case of most traders, however, the reality is different. They act in the same manner they would do if they had they been “hypnotized”. A great many traders keep on mulling over events of the past, either because they fail to use their heads, or because they only utilize automatic systems. The use of an automatic system is always based on historical data. Every theory, too, must be grounded on the past. In reality, the only way of acting in a variable market is BEING STEEPED IN REALITY. By adapting ourselves to reality and by accepting it, we shall maximize the function which likelihood discharges.
