Couples Recently, I saw a couple for therapy in which the husband disconnected. He was out-there and disconnected and she over- identified. This problem emerges often in couples therapy. The complaint from the wife, "He's at work, he's doing this, he's doing that, I'm stuck with the kids. I'm here. He's there," He's discon- nected from being here, and She' s over-identified with being here, and she cannot disconnect and be there. During the therapy, I discovered the father of this woman was an alcoholic. She handled this in childhood by becoming the caretaker. She had to take care of the situation, always be there, or identify, take care of her father, her mother, the family. It was her job, so she identified and fused. She had to stay here, glued. If she didn't, who knew what would happen? She perceived her father might crack up the car; she had to feed the kids, be responsible, etc. The observer handled the situation by creating an inner child identity which utilized the trance of over-identification.
