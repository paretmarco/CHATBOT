In Quantum Physics we are dealing with probabilities; it is possible for a chair to float up into the sky—but what is the probability of that occuring To appreciate this, let us suppose someone has a phobia or low self-esteem. Can Rolfing or Feldenkrais handle the phobia by itself? The probability is low. If someone has low self-esteem, can Feldenkrais or Rolfing handle this psychological issue by itself? The probability is low. To illustrate the interconnection of body—►mind, obviously if you have a phobia, there must be a change in your breathing pattern and the way your body is standing (posture) in order to heal the phobia (or bad self-esteem, etc.). Maybe your feet lose their connection to the ground and you're not properly supported when you're feeling phobic. This interconnection must be appreciated and understood so that the body, mind and spirit are seen as the same and equal. Therefore, not only is "psychological" work alone not enough, but "body-work" or somatic re-education alone is not enough either. Neither is "spiritual" work alone enough to discover WHO YOU ARE. Why not?
