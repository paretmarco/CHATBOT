Usually, this behaviour ensures that even if a trader with a “projection” of growth of a particular stock “in the future”, when in fact the ruling price of such stock actually decreases, is granted the chance of a way out of such calamitous projection, he remains rooted in it, due to the fact he is convinced that, at some imaginary future, he will score a gain. He is accordingly inclined to trespass the limits he had set for himself at the start. This conduct allures him into a postponement of the losses, the significance of which then increasingly grows in magnitude. Trading is a system in which one sometimes gains and at other times loses. If you are unwilling to accept this simple truth, you will be swept away by the losses you will incur. As stated by Alexander Elder: “A winner accepts his losses. A loser defers them”. The words by which some traders engage in negative self-hypnosis Another important factor is that even the language we use might contribute to our negative “self-hypnosis. Words, in fact, exercise an influence over our beings, and they, too, represent hypnotic elements which we unconsciously apply on our own selves.
