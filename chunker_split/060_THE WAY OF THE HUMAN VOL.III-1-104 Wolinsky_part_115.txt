Is the "I" you call you" a product of the Electromagnetic mechanism? There is an "I" and an "observer" that is part of the mechanism. The whole thing is part of the mechanism. Therapeutic Note Here we see there is no-her separate from the Archetypal Electra-Magnetic Mechanism and that the "I" is a by-product of and part of the Archetype itself. Wolinsky:How you doing? Louise:Real good. ________________ Chapter Louise:Still pulsates and moves in all directions, it moves around a central core. Wolinsky:Since the "I" and the observer are by-products of the I AM which is a by-product of the Electromagnetic mechanism, who is answering the question? Louise:Silence. Therapeutic Note Since the "I" is only a by-product of the Electro-magnetic mechanism, once this is acknowledged there is no Archetype and hence NO-I Wolinsky:If this mechanism was no longer there would you be? Louise:Yes. Wolinsky:As what? Therapeutic Note Here we are going for the I AM associated with the Electra-magnetic mechanism.
