During this phase, we in fact communicate with the outermost part of the person we are dealing with, in other words, with his psychology. Once we have created a connection at this level, a second and possibly even a third terrain might open up. What occurs in the “second terrain” is that we are going to thicken this energy field of ours, to make it denser, whereupon our interlocutor shall sense our “presence”. Frightening things might be accomplished in this phase. Instantaneous hypnoses, too, might be generated when one enters this state. Synoptic recapitulation of the different phases: Presence: It is the foundation, the first level Communicative Capacity: It is needed for the sake of laying the "initial terrain" Creation of a Coherence Field: It is the moment when we intervene at a deeper level than the level of the normal self, that is, the one in which we intervene, in order to bring about the realization of results, through a self which is ordinarily unconscious and which is linked to a person’s most profound layers.
