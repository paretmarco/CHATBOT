When this is not done for the child in a "good enough way," a false grandiose self is developed which thinks it can do, create, have whatever it wants, that it is source and that it can create and control the subjective experience of another. Unfortunately, when this occurs, adults don't see themselves clearly; they believe they're special, magical or chosen. This feeling of specialness, magicalness, or being chosen, denies human limitations and removes them from humanity, separating them further from other people and from the underlying quantum unity. It must be understood that feelings of being special or different from another are red flags that identities are operating. Why? To really experience and stabilize in the Essential experience of compassion, we must give up our feelings of differentness and specialness and see ourselves as part of the same human family. Magicalness and specialness develop because the infant sees mom as magical and stays merged with this magical mom fantasy and begins to believe the fantasy and, hence, see themselves as magical. Many workshop leaders, teachers and gurus hook their participants with claims that "you can have it all."
