Wolinsky:So if you notice the BIG EMPTINESS the False Core is floating in and the False Core and if you took the label off of it and saw the EMPTINESS and the False Core, as the same substance, notice what happens as you continue to feel that waviness now. Have 80% of your attention in that waviness. About 10% noticing if anything pops up and about 10% have here when you open your eyes. Student:Thank you. That's great. THE ESSENTIAL CORE The Essential Core is what is "you" beyond your False Core-False Self and your psychology. It is very pure, hence, the word "Essential." During the shock of the Realization of Separation, the misnamed, (mis)labeled and (mis)perceived quality of ESSENCE called spaciousness is labeled emptiness, (as in a lack) and is blamed. In this way you believe that you have no core, no Essential Core, and that you are empty (as in a lack). You then adapt or take on a False Core which you know is False, but at least you have a core.
