In transactional analysis negative strokes are considered better than no strokes. This is a particularly difficult process in that the Blocking Out + 75 blocking-out is interpreted as enjoyable or as how it should be, and is therefore not questioned, nor acknowledged. I saw a man once whose father was a minister in Southern Ohio. His father quite often would bring the boy down to the basement. There he would have him pull down his pants, and spank him. The boy felt incredible pain, but eventually interpreted the sensations as pleasurable. Years later, he was involved in sado-masochist sex. Upon entering therapy, he felt that his interest in being physically hurt, which gave him sexual pleasure, was going too far, i.e., he had put himself in life-threatening situations. After many sessions, images began to appear in his memory. While his father was spanking him, his father would masturbate. Here the child within blocked out the pain of the spanking and interpreted it as pleasur- able, because it was the only way he seemed to get love and affection from Dad. Years later, this generalized to the only way to get sexual love and affection: by being spanked or hurt physically.
