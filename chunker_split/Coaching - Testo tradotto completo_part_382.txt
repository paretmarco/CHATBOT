If we are prepared to concede that telepathy or transmission of the thought truly exists, - and plentiful people do not even allow for the possibility of entertaining any doubt to that effect, - we ought to recognize in this context the presence of a force which gushes out of this primal source. It is not for us to debate here about the existence or otherwise of this subtle emanation endowed with the capacity of turning an individual into a magnetic person, given that, assuming such a subtle fluid actually exists, it is subjected to the guidance and authority of the mind, and is developed owing to the exercises which have been set out in the course of this book. Oneâ€™s look, when it is suitably trained, can seduce and subjugate. Its significance is far greater than the purely physical beauty of the eyes. What is required is other than lending them some kind of hard fixity. Rather, what we need to learn is to develop a special expression enabling our eyes to acquire their full splendour as well as a smilingly sweet force of penetration. The exercises we have spread out in the first part of this work will have already taught you how to possess a potent look.
