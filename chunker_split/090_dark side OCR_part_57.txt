In 1993, the 42 year old woman has a wounded inner child that pops up when John tries to be intimate. The observer trance-fers the past occurrence with Uncle Henry in 1950 to the present one with John. The present-day woman age regresses and becomes the wounded child who freezes, feels scared, and may or may not know why. De-hypnosis undoes the trance of the past so the memory that pops up can get placed in the background as a memory, rather than trance-ferred over present-time reality, as a foreground. In this case the observer takes a picture of the little girl being molested and the perpetrator (Uncle Henry). Both parts reside within the inner child, i.e., victim and perpetrator. These two parts of the inner child become the world view of men even years later. Hence the perpetrator gets trance-ferred on men and the victim feels scared, or the victim gets trance-ferred on a child and the perpetra- tor-part of the inner child takes over and abuses. It is the perpetrator-part of the inner child that molests children; that is why the research demonstrates that almost all child molesters were molested as children. Let me give another example.
