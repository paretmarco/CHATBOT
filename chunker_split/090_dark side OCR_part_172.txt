Years go by and she forgets that she is a little child in the dreams. Now she is 30 and not ready to live the dream. A critical shift in viewpoint is required; the old dream puts her in conflict with the reality of today. At this point the therapist starts bringing the dream into a level of reality organiza- tion, i.e., what's real and what's not real, in present time. If you do not dream or have interrupted your dreaming, it' s critical to work with yourself to develop the skill of trance dream- ing; this interrupts the inner child's hypervigilant identity. Some creative ideas will come out of this new skill. Self-interruptions, invented in childhood, undermine peoples' ability to dream. Parents give many suggestions when they say, "Be realistic," which means, "See the world the way I see it." The child stops himself from ever really going into his own dream state.
