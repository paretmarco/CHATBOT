This trance of the inner child (making someone the source of your love) steals the responsibility of the adult who now believes someone else is responsible for his love of self or how he feels about himself. You are responsible for your perception and your experience of love or lack of love. Adult Problem State: The guru (parent) is responsible for my spiritual growth. In this scenario the child feels, and rightly so, that his growth both physically and psychologi- cally, is dependent on his parents. The parents are responsible for feeding and otherwise taking care of their children. Children are vulnerable and need their parents' care. Hence, they are dependent and powerless. When the person sepa- rates from the parents, then their child "grows up," taking responsibility for her own physical and psychological growth and well-being. If, however, the child stays fixated, the child within the adult trance-fern this desire to be taken care of onto a guru/God, who becomes responsible for her spiritual growth. In one community in India, the teaching was, "The guru takes responsibility for your spiritual unfolding."
