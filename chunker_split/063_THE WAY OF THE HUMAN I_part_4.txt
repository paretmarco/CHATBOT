These books are therefore designated as notebooks, to be used as notebooks, with the assumption that the reader will study them and go back to the earlier Quantum Psychology Volumes since this present work in many respect might require some previous background. I decided to place the introduction prior to the dedication and acknowledgments because I wanted to be clear about who and in which "book" (of the three) the dedications should go. In other words, each Volume has different dedications and major influences. When this Quantum event "began" to solidify, the possibility of writing a three Volume series called the Way of the Human had not quite occurred to "me." In this, the first of three Volumes, Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness, I wanted to encapsulate a major focus of Quantum Psychology the development of multi-dimensional awareness as a "possible" step in the discovery of Who You Are. MAJOR INFLUENCES As I was writing the introduction to The Way of the Human trilogy, I recalled that shortly after Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology was released in 1990, I received a phone call from Peter Madell, a doctor in Northern California.
