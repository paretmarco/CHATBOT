iiallucination would .have.been suggested so that she could pass right by the potato chips with. out noticing them. Either way, a Deep Trance Phenomenon is being suggested or induced as a way of blocking the occurrence of the symptom or interrupting its â€¢pattern of manifestation. Ire ile approach I am describing. by contrast, the Deep Trance Phenomenon that is already functioning at the core of the person's svmoomatology is allowed to manifest to the fullest extent possible, acid then it is worked with therapeutically. It. is that already occurring trance state that is itself creating the symptom and interrupting the person's experience of inner and outer resources available in the proem moment. once this trance state is taken off "automatic," the symptom .tructure can begin to dissipate. Erickson and Rossi believe that "habitual frames of reference" must be depotentiated or bypassed in order to induceffaci I itate a therapeutic trance experience (Erickson & Rossi, 1976): Erickson believes that the purpose of clinical induction is to focus attention inward and alter some of the ego's habitual patterns of functioning.
