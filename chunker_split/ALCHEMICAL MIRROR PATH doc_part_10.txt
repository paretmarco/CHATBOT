After, in this superior state the sensation of vertigo could even be voluntarily increased in intensity and be brought to a superior level, near to the loss of consciousness. THIRD STAGE - LUCID DREAMING IN WAKING STATE (??) If you are able to be present you will be able to reach a further step. In this step you will become aware at the same time of two realities and you will be beyond the normal ego, above the flow of dreaming thoughts that are created by your abitual being. Those who are able to overcome the point in which they risked to succomb to the vertigo and be carried over by the flow of dreams, they will be like walking above the waters. In fact, passing beyond the threeshold of this "death" they may, after a barrage of trials, get even used to the vertigo itself and not suffer it, rather almost no notice at all, and therefore lead with perfect lucidity the gap between the two modes of being, leaving the physical body in a state of apparent death to live another life, and then regain consciously the primitive state. You will stay on two worlds at the same time.
