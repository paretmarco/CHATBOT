There is always, in fact, a close rapport between consciousness and vision. Some scholars have put forward the theory that the actual ocular pathologies which we can observe are often the reflection of our models of thinking. Kellum, for instance, says: The eye responds to the way in which we live. 11. The Varieties of daily Trance The sight, as with all the other senses, is susceptible of erring. Errors of observation happen frequently, since a personâ€™s look perceives merely one side of the things, and, by blending with imagination, it ensures that we focus on some aspects of reality rather than others, such aspects being guided by modes of interpretation adopted by the reality of our mind. Some examples of these illusions are indeed very clear. That is the case, for instance, of the illusions which might befall a night traveller when he finds himself by some isolated place, one where uncertainty, and possibly fright, bring about in him the thought that he is seeing some people moving, though in truth there are only trees, or which might seize a nocturnal fisherman who, in the mist, might perceive the lunar rays turning into ghosts.
