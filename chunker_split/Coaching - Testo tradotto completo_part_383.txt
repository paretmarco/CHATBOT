Here is a list of some additional instructions in this regard: Use of the look Mental Attitude: A powerful look must, of course, consist in more than a mere attitude: It must be an inward state. You will never be able to have an appearance of resoluteness without being truly resolute. It is not possible for you to carry out things you yourselves do not believe you are capable of doing. When one is facing LACK of such SELF-CONFIDENCE, all you could possibly do is to have a desire to implement such things. The lack of confidence, the absence of faith in yourselves, will curb your will to power to such an extent that you will be disabled from resorting to it at all. This is one of the most important aspects on which you should keep on reflecting without any pause. If you inwardly feel yourselves unable to influence other people, you will in no way have the possibility of actually deploying your will to power.
