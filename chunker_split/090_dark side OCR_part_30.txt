You, the observer and creator of this pleasing wounded child identity. This identity now creates many different ways (which will be discussed later) to keep this process alive. Three important points come from this quantum understanding: (1) you are the creator and observer of the wounded pleasing child, (2) you are beyond this identity, and (3) "healing" this wounded child is a false concept. Why? In order to heal this identity you must "get" that you are the source of this identity. Once you get the experiential understanding of this, you can take responsibility for creating it and stop creating it. To try to heal, say the "right things" to, re-frame, or re-decide the inner child only adds to the created identity and keeps it alive. In other words, you must keep the identity present and functioning in order to heal it. Many therapies imply, "All parts serve a useful purpose." Quantum Psychology says, "All parts served a useful purpose" (past tense). Why keep creating them automatically?
