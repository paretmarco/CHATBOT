We might thus imagine, for example, to meet a very dear friend we are accustomed to confide in, in order for us to subsequently “project” this balsamic image onto our tangible interlocutor. The important aspect is to engage in such projection at the time of our first impact with the human interaction marking the planned meeting. Once we have managed to project our intended image at the beginning of it, our unconscious will later take over and perpetuate the projection automatically.
