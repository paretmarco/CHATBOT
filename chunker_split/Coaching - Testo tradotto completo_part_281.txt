In the left one we are going to mark the date; as for the right frame, we will reserve it for some motto linked to “kairòs”, to what we would like to conjure up during the day. It will be some verbal summation, some reminder pointing us to the spiritual tendency which we ought to adhere to throughout that specific day. As this tendency is going to be reviewed several times in the course of a single day, it will eventually imprint a specific mark in our psychological activity, that is, the distinguishing mark which ought to colour with its peculiar hue our soul, our character, irrespective of the external events of the day. One can premeditate such mental attitude the night before, by evoking it at the time when our spirit is gathered in itself 64. We are lastly going to reserve some space for two additional elements. Space should be made, in one section, for annotations which will be useful for our future activity: Orientations, thoughts, reflections, calculations, etc, as the case might be.
