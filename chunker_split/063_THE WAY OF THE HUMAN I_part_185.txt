So, rather than trying to get rid of our so-called negative feelings, as most kinds of therapy suggest, we can begin to experience them as energy. You'll be amazed once you've done this a couple of times. When I first did it, I was feeling furious. But when I dropped the story—my mind was popping up reasons—when I really stopped and turned my attention inside, I was in ecstasy in about five seconds. From that point on, I understood experientially how to begin the work of transmuting the energy of emotions or transmuting my experience of them. As you begin to turn your attention in—and it is a practice because you are turning habitual attention around—it will start happening on its own. It's like to learning to play some kind of sport. At first you feel very awkward, but after a while, things start falling into place. When get into a pool, you don't have to think about swimming, you just swim. You don't have to think about holding your breath underwater, you just do it. As you practice, it comes quite spontaneously.
