This, according the Herzberg, isn't possible, and so assembly line work- ers act as children with high turnover rates and low productivity. Three Types of Confusion 1. Task Confusion Confusion can take three forms. In the first type, parents make demands that are not possible to achieve or are viewed as over- whelming by the child. These overwhelming parental expectations, which the child is unable to fulfill, create feelings of confusion and chaos. The confusion becomes the mechanism or way the child handles the event. For example, the parent expects the child to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by himself at age three. The observer creates confusion and the child feels overwhelmed and confused. The confusion gets generalized to everything they are asked to do. Even years later they become overwhelmed and confused when asked to perform certain tasks. The confused inner child remains frozen, generalizing confusion onto many situations, events, or arenas. The child within the adult feels constant pressure to perform or do the task perfectly. Overtones of being judged or feelings of incompetency or inadequacy follow this trance.
