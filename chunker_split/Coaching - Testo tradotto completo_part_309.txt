The people who are ordinarily prey to doubt do not — in general — think in accordance with any plan. They rather dream about the worst consequences imaginable. As a result of that, they are never present to their own selves, and never cohere firmly to the relevant fact. They lack, in short, that precious ability which is named by us «presentification» 66. Every person might acquire the habit of taking a prompt, brisk and voluntary decision just as any one else. You should persist, at the cost of making errors, in willing yourselves capable of resolving upon something promptly, and you should especially remind yourselves of the fact that no more exception should be allowed henceforth. A useful exercise in this regard consists in assigning a certain percentage to error, and then acknowledging it as one conceivable possibility. At this point, you must accustom yourselves to realize your objectives. If you are busy doing something, try and divide it into shorter phases which you then punctiliously complete in full. It is from the energy of the action that progress depends.
