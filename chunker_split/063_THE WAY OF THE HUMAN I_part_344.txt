Simply put, they have collapsed the levels and are age-regressed, trying to find a model of how to be. For example, recently a former trainee of mine said to me, "You are my model of how to do therapy." Another trainee watching me do a Quantum process in a workshop said that I "modeled the state." 221 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness I said to both trainees, "I am not a model for how to do therapy, nor do I model a state of consciousness. I do therapy as I do therapy, and the state I'm in is not a modeling but rather just who I am and where I am at the moment." But people age-regress and look for models or formulas of how to be or do, imagining that when they model in this way, they can get the same or similar results, rather than discovering who they are in life and doing therapy from who they are. Therapists often imply that they are, or they should be, a model.
