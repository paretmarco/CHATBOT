Please note that the False Core is a representation and a reason given for why the shock of the Realization of Separation took place. Later in life your relationships are based on the following principles: you must either 1) reflect them; 2) try to get them to reflect you in order to merge and not feel the shock of the Realization of Separation or; 3) resist them so that you can have a self, etc. Unfortunately, the greatest difficulty in "seeing" this clearly within oneself or others is tied-up in psychologizing, philosophizing, and spiritualizing. PSYCHOLOGIZING: A process whereby we develop an entire psychology-philoso- phy and lifestyle, and oftentimes a profession which justifies and defends us against and re-enforces the Narcissistic Wound. For example, I met a psychologist in Indiana. To handle her mother's dysfunctional and unpredictable behavior she would "go into her mother's experience," (mind read), analyze and figure out "where she was" and give her an "appropriate response" in an attempt to control her mother's chaotic reactions. Years later when she became a psychologist, she was excellent at figuring out and diagnosing her clients.
