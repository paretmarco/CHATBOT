You must first exhale from the lungs as much air as you can, whereafter you slowly inhale it through the nose, making sure to keep the mouth closed. At that stage, draw in the greatest possible amount of air, and follow that by holding the breath as you slowly count up to five. You finally draw out the air from the mouth, whereupon you repeat the exercise after a few secondsâ€™ break. You should strive to repeat it three or four times in succession, and try to hold your breath for progressively longer periods as you go through the exercise again. After three or four mornings during which you practice it, this exercise might then be shelved aside in favour of carrying out the following one. Exercise 30 Put yourselves in the abovementioned position; exhale as much as air as you can from the lungs and, as you inhale, lift up your arms once more, horizontally, forcing yourselves to keep them as stiff as possible. You should ensure to spend as much time in forming a right angle with your arms and the rest of your body as it is necessary for you to inject air into the lungs.
