â€¢4 Age Regression: Acting Younger Than You Are I was dreaming of the past and my heart was beating fast, I began to lose control I began to lose control... I was feeling insecure You don't love me anymore I was shivering inside I was shivering inside I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry I didn't mean to hurt I'm just a jealous guy. "Jealous Guy," John Lennon 26 * The Dark Side of the Inner Child In this song from the Imagine album, Lennon talks of two trances. First, he shifted from being an adult in present time to being a wounded child in past time. Secondly, he didn't lose control; rather, he became the inner child who was frozen, lost control and was shivering, scared, and jealous. Lennon could have called the song "Jealous Wounded Child" rather than "Jealous Guy", because, in order to feel the feelings, he had to become the inner child (dreaming of the past) and age regress (become younger than he was). Isn't this a familiar process for us all?
