cause a dissociation, a splitting off from the body which creates beliefs about "appropriate" actions at "appropriate" tunes, i.e., "There is a time and place for everything." This causes us to eat, not when we're hungry, but at about 12:00 p.m. Not to shit when we need to, but to hold it in. Not to sleep as much as we need, but to organize it around work. And not to have sex when it feels right but to wait until the evening. When a survey asked about when people mostly have sex, the overwhelming majority said after 9:30 p.m. on either Friday or Saturday night In addition, bodily functions and impulses are seen as bad by many spiritual systems. The dissociation from the body is oftentimes labeled as good or as spiritual. Much of our early childhood training is about regulation of the body. In this way, there is an implication and message given to the child that there is something wrong with the body and its functions and certainly it is less than the mind, and of much less importance than the spirit.
