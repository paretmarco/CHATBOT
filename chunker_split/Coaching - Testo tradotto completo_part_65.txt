Some people might raise the objection that preventing cerebral wandering can have the effect of disavowing the marked importance chance plays in relation to our discoveries. It is however precisely the act of ridding oneself of reiterated and impulsive ideas which enables the emergence of the gems of creativity. That way, you will discover, as a norm, that a direct connection with a purpose in life is more fertile than a casual one. The Intended Goal The criterion of usefulness, which is viewed as the sole and exclusive norm that regulates the activity of our brain, encompasses all the different professions and activities, including those which are called “optional”, such as music and arts. What we mean by useful is every thing that leads to an intended aim. We deem it important, after all, to highlight the fact that only the activity which is coordinated (in the sense of being disciplined) is able to lead to a practical result. Otherwise, if the activity does not fall into that category, we will become the victims of what we might term “law of the least resistance”, i.e. when we give our mind free rein to act, it will invariably seek to conserve energies.
