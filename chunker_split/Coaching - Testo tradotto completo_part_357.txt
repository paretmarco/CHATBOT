Before doing that, however, focus your thought on the sign of the mathematical infinite: What is required is to mentally trace, without any break and for progressively longer time spans, the mathematical sign of the infinite ?, which resembles a reclined 8. Imagine yourselves, therefore, being able to see this immensely huge sign shine out in great relief against some dark background. You must, starting from any point, follow the continuous curve, without ever taking off the eyes of the mind. Let go of yourselves afterwards. As soon as you have fallen asleep, the pressure exercised by the finger will come to an end naturally. This light pressure is going to facilitate “ocular convergence”, as well as to create a favourable state for accessing subtler dimensions. Final considerations The final result turns out to be exceptionally brilliant, and one exceeding any prior expectation; all our students recount the fact that they feel better already in the immediate aftermath of the implementation of the exercise.
