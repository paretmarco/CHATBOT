For example, the discomfort is restricted by putting into action specific, modifiable strategies, hence, detaching from the subject labeled “needy”. Recognizing the importance of empathy (fundamental in good doctor-patient relations and usually at risk in all types of psychotherapy) in the creation of models helps in: the training of it, the speed of application, and the proposing of models that can help with every communication step whether individual or group. PNL together with INSTANT RAPPORT are the most adapt instruments to intervene on an individual and social level. PNL deals with the most advanced frontiers of hypnotic and cognitive therapies, linked together in a clear way. Its main purpose, therefore, consists of the definition of itself as a group of models and not a theory. MODEL = a description of how something works without having to explain why. THEORY = reasons have to be found to explain why. The proposed models have been obtained by way of summing up and putting into action results gained from other communication academics. Example: The recovery of Pavlov’s work is evident in the use of the anchoring technique. From this viewpoint, the changing of the subject can only happen through the reframing of their internal representations so that a change of this type corresponds to an exterior alteration. “The world does not have to be put into order, the world is order incarnate. It’s up to us to find the right way of harmoniously positioning ourselves in it”.
