They lack consciousness of a central point of harmony which might grant them the opportunity to steer their own actions ... The attendant result is that, rather than thrusting forward, they constantly find themselves thrown back to some point of departure, to an invariably different goal. This kind of person is lost in self- dispersion. Truly speaking such people are not apathetic. Indeed, in many instances they are very active, and yet they are confused souls at the mercy of a thousand divergent impulses, as if the array of disparate characters making up their personalities alternately sought to overcome each other in an ongoing mutual squabble. Their intimate being is perennially absent, a mere absent-minded and passive spectator of the struggle of which he is the battlefield. These people do not really know what they want. There is no end to the number of people who simply dream up their existence rather than actually carving it out for themselves. Such individuals live in a reality of thoughts which they cannot link to the strength of their actions.
