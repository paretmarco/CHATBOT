As you keep still in the said fashion, you should strive to see and recognize the people walking to your right or to your left, read the posters, count the windows and the trees, etc. This exercise is of a capital importance, and it should be adopted as an invariable norm. It is after all the secret of the mobility and variety of oneâ€™s look. Exercise 17. The farewell look While on the road, a bus, a train compartment, a railway, stare at any object that has popped up in front of you (ahead of you, to your right or to your left), and, while you unceasingly keep your head motionless, begin to fix it as the vehicle draws you close to such object. When you are about to move past it, you should not let go of the object with your sight. Rather, you should follow it all the way until some intervening hindrance wrests it away from your sight. It will be good if you can alternate the exercise by fixing objects on your right as well as on your left, so as to train both eyes.
