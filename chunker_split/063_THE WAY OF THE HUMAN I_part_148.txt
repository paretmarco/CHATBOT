"I feel good because I meditated this morning." "I feel good because I had a lot for dinner." "I feel good because I didn't' have a lot for dinner." Around noon, a thought goes by which says, "I'm tired," and if you identify with that thought, you might say, "I'm tired, why do I have to go to work? It's such a drag. I knew I slept too much—or I didn't sleep enough," or whatever the sequence of events you might be experiencing. What happens is, a thought arises and subsides, and there's a space. This is the way thoughts occur: they arise, and subside—and there's space. The purpose of this practice is to bring you back into the space between two thoughts or prior to your last thought. Understand that anything you identify with yields a limiting experience. For example, a thought goes by called "I feel good," or "I feel bad, I wish I were there, I'm here, I wish I weren't here."
