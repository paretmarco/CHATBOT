Futurizing is experienced by people who are in a daily state of free-floating anxiety. Futurizing has elements of inner dialogues and age regression. The goal is to work and emancipate yourself from the child' s trance, and dehypnotize yourself, to resolve the anxiety. Trances of the inner child are born of chaos, so how could a child born of chaos produce anything else but chaos? The inner child looks through a window of chaos and trys to rectify it through trance, creating even more present-time chaos. An example is a little girl or boy who grows up in a dysfunc- tional family. These children will read and identify with a story like Horatio Alger, an impoverished child that became rich and success- ful. Another example is the girl who grows up with the classic "Cinderella" complex. Here the observer creates the state; "Every- thing is so awful that some day Prince Charming is going to take me away from all this." These trance systems helped the child handle the situation. When reality is threatening, he/she imagines a more pleasant, successful future. In my forthcoming book, The Tao of Chaos, we will explore the resistance to chaos as precluding development of all systems.
