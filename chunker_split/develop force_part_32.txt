You will see the results already achieved with the previous exercise improving. Exercise 6 Another exercise you can do often and with many benefits is staring to an object at short distance, getting closer to it always staring, never lowering eyelids. In addition to its attractive effect, a nurtured gaze allows expressing different thoughts and feelings with an intensity that deeply impresses; in addition, the action of such a hypnotic gaze gives to whoever owns it a precious ascendancy. With the practice of fascination, you can perform a series of exercises very simple, also called “basic exercises". Here we will teach now some of those basic exercises, assuming the fixity already obtained. 1 ° in a living room, in the Church, theater, or any other meeting place, where several people are sitting one at the front of the other, gaze at the nape a person placed ahead of you at a distance of 2-3 meters concentrating all your energy on the idea of acting on her and make her turn, which will happen if the person is sensitive. You can also direct the action of the eyes on the two scapular or combine them into one point, for example on one of the first dorsal vertebrae. It is interesting to notice that very often the person will react immediately after your look. 2 ° make another attempt on the street, remaining two meters behind the chosen person. 3 ° with the second successful experience, you may want that person turning to the right or left.
