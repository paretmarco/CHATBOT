The NON VERBAL I AM is the No-State state prior to, and it is without using, thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or per ceptions. In contrast, the Verbal I AM occurs in the newer brain or the cortex and is prior to I am (fill in the blank with your False Core or False Self). Being Prior to your False Core-False Self, the verbal I AM is the root of your psychology. No verbal I AM, no I AM a False Core-False Self. Nisargadatta Maharaj attempted to nip the False Core in the bud by staying in the verbal I AM prior to the False Core I AM (fill in the blank), and then onto the NON-VERBAL I AM. It is important to differentiate the difference between ESSENCE and I AM. ESSENCE has Essential qualities. When you The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology are prior to Essential qualities, you have the NON-VERBAL I AM. So you could say that the NON-VERBAL I AM is the ESSENCE of ESSENCE. It is prior to any qualities and, hence, it is a No-State state. The NON-VERBAL I AM is without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions.
