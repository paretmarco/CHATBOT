The reciprocal corollary of such law is that the act brings about the idea, and you will thus be forever barred from getting into this way of acting “effortlessly” so long as you make yourselves unceasingly restless. “Identifying oneself with the action clouds the mind” (Tao Te king) If you are present, you might then allow the body to “act naturally” and follow its own path. Such “natural acting” is developed on the strength of the association of ideas, and it resembles creative activity. A major event, once it is subjected to an analysis, is shown to be nothing other than a sequence of small events. A small event is in turn made up of most tiny actions which are related to one another. The factor determining the smallness or greatness of a specific act is not the amount of fatigue which is required to perform it, but rather its ultimate meaning, that is, the influence it is going to exercise on our life and the life of our fellow humans. The same action is involved by lighting up a cigarette or setting fire to an ammunition warehouse, yet it does not produce a uniform effect in the two separate scenarios.
