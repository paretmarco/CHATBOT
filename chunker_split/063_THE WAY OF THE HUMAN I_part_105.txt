To imagine that UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which has no awareness, no awarer and N04, creates, wants, prefers, has a will and volition—this is from the perspective of differentiated consciousness or a separate "r which attributes human qualities of a nervous system, wanting, preferring etc.. onto UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which has no nervous system, this is anthropomorphic; where you project a nervous system onto something that does not have one. For example, Source wants this, Source likes that, or God wants this, the universe wants that, etc. None of these has a nervous system—but are projected onto by a Nervous System. 54 ________________ CONCLUSION EYOND QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY (VOLUME III) The False Core and False Self Compensator are a shorthand, a psycho-emotional abstraction, but ultimately this has to be looked and gone beyond.

Or as the old Zen saying puts it, "The finger that points the moon is not the moon."
