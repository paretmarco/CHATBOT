â€¢9 Illusioning: Seeing, Hearing andFeeling What Is Not There I was trying to catch your eye, I thought that you were trying to hide I was swallowing my pain I was swallowing my pain "Jealous Boy" John Lennon Here John Lennon describes his illusioning. The inner child imagines his wife is trying to hide; and that she doesn't love him anymore. He age regresses and feels pain. In other words his illusioning of Yoko trying to hide, created a painful trance for the adult in present time. 82 0 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Illusion: a false mental image or conception which may be a mis-interpretation of a real appearance or may be some- thing imagined. (American College Dictionary, pg 602) Selective Trances The inner child sees past time, imagining it is present time, thus "illusions," seeing things now that were there then. In this way, the inner child within the adult reads into things now, things that were said then, feels things now that were felt then, but are not actually happening now, or hears things now that were said then.
