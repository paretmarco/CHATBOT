In the second small column, one will have to mark with a cross those operations which have already been finalized. Avoid, in that manner, the possibility of erasing from the list those operations which have been already carried out, as we are duty-bound to locate them subsequently, at the time, that is, of analytically revisiting the whole day. The change in the order of operations might even be the product of the type of activity involved. Every activity in fact inevitably demands a particular mental attitude, and it is thus preferable to carry out that activity which best suits the mental attitude we might have at any given moment. The converse is likewise true. Be it as it may, the various points must have been exhaustively gone through by the end of the day. The second part of the page is occupied by a column in which one is going to set out those occupations which have to be implemented within an undefined time span, as the need for them progressively arises. It will be up to us to assign to them a precise position within our future activity.
