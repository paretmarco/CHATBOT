The purpose behind the exercise is to automatically enlarge the shape of the eye. While keeping the eyes open, therefore, take care not to cross the eyebrows, and to leave them instead in their normal position. [27] Exercise 21. The spot on the mirror This is an adaptation of the preceding exercise, which is however carried out for a different reason. By resorting to a pen or a pencil, you should draw a large black spot over the surface of a mirror. Place then yourself in front of the mirror, in such a manner as to perceive that spot by the base of your nose rather than on the mirror. You ought to simultaneously inject your look with an intense expression, in so doing striving to be truly permeated by that feeling which you want your eyes to give expression to. Exercise 22. With one eye only Repeat now the immediately preceding exercise, only that this time you shall carry it out by using one eye only, covering with your hand, alternatively bandaging, the right eye or the left one at alternate times.
