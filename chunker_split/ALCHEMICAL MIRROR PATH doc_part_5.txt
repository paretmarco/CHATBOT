This type of vision, practiced with mirrors, jugs or other tools is also fundamental basis for the work of the Fascinators as it develops a particular energetic sensibility that allows the fascinator to be infallible, because he can operate not only in physical dimension, but also in an energetic dimension not yet fully elucidated by modern science, but no less real in its effects. Here are some notes from the Italian tradition. This tradition is from an ancient origin. In ancient Egypt and Greece, starting around the seventh century BCE, the person initiated of the "mystery" cults, were conducted through a serie of passages, one of which was a symbolic death. This symbolic death was the "death of the self". It opened the mind of the practitioner to a wider dimension. In working with the mirror this is accomplished by entering deep in the dream and after transcending our physical and astral/emotional state by opening up to an higher dimension where will be at a superior level, where we will see the physical stage and the imagining stage as something "below" us. OPUS 1 â€“ Climbing The four Stages Let's see now the different steps of an interesting work with mirrors that will make you more and more aware of different level of consciousness. First step is the physical. We will look at a mirror and we will have various distortions. Second step is called "fluidic". Our mind will begin to project in this space, and get glimpses of an higher level of reality Third step is "etheric". We will go beyond the dream.
