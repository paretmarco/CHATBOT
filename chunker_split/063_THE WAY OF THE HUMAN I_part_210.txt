The body and the nervous system are a quantum event, i.e., the body is condensed VOID OR UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. This basic principle is both Einstein's and Buddha's foundation. "Everything is made of EMPTINESS and form is condensed EMPTINESS." Or Buddha's "Form is none other than EMPTINESS, EMPTINESS none other than form. 2. When we "see" the body as a quantum event, we mean that the EMPTINESS condenses down forming a body with a nervous system and that the body and the nervous system cannot see the Quantum event. 3. Given that the body and the nervous system are also a condensation of EMPTINESS, they therefore select certain experiences and reject others. The latter part of the statement comes from the work of Alfred Korzybski. What was "left out" or omitted from Korzybski is that the perceiving mechanism and the nervous system itself are an abstraction of that Emptiness or Quantum level. This is a major error in Korzybski's general semantics. Its omission explains why Korzybski's students face frustrating problems in getting the "changes" they want through what Korsybski called Neuro-Linguistic Feedback. 4.
