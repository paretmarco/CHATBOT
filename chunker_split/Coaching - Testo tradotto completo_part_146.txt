The choleric man, after all, makes a positive impact only the first time one comes across him, but that is soon followed by people laughing behind his back, with clear knowledge of the fact that the choleric person’s decisions are seldom final. A sure-proof means to avoid outbursts of anger as much as possible is to always be connected with our fellow human beings on the basis of calm and clearly defined relationships. The rules which are needed to achieve that objective can be subsumed under a single one: To uniformly treat every one, whether higher or lower, superior or subordinate, as our equal. We must respect the individuality of every person, and reflect over the truth that the world is beautiful precisely because it offers variety, and that it is quite likely that the person to whom you show aversion to harbours the same feeling towards you while having the undivided merit that he does not openly disclose it. In every person, even those people who are lower and children, you ought to respect the quality which is intrinsic to man (his ”humanness”) 43.
