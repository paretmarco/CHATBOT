The child's anger has been interrupted by Mom. In this case the child learns to interrupt the outward motion of anger by internalizing Mom's voice (inner dialogue), i.e., "You shouldn't be angry." Since the motion is interrupted, the energy must go somewhere. The child puts it back on herself. The inner child then develops body postures and chronic body armor to block the anger from being expressed, and often from being felt. To create new meaning for the external "button-pusher," ask yourself, "What causes the response? What is the external stimulus that triggers this pattern?" A man came to see me who was positive the woman he had been involved with for several years was going to break up with him. He had been married for 15 years when his wife left him for another man. Seven years after his wife left, he only had one-night stands because he was still hurt. He reported, "I went into a shell." He then met the woman in question, and they became emotionally involved, living together on and off. Things were a little uncertain.
