As an example, a woman who is treated in her family as unintelligent might experience this as painful and try hard to fight against it. Inside, her frozen inner child continues to create the trance, "I'm not smart." This seems to occur in individuals fre- quently. Often times, physical symptoms like migraine headaches, ulcers, and colitis accompany these emotional problems. After all, it takes a lot of energy to hold back the natural life force of the body. Interestingly enough, the word "emotion" can be broken down into "e" meaning outward, and "motion", hence, outward motion. Psy- chologically and physically, an interruption in outward motion can cause both psychological and physical disease. As another example, let's imagine a child who has a powerful energy motion toward Mom. Mom labels that energy "anger" and "thwarts it" either by words, punishment or withdrawal of love. That outward flow of energy, which is now labeled "anger" must go somewhere. Where does it go? The child puts it back on herself creating self-anger, self-hatred, guilt and/or depression.
