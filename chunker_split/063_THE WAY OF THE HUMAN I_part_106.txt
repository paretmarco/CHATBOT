ESSENCE, the I AM, the underlying unity or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS 55 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is the goal and the "how to" is the finger (in this case Quantum Psychology) must be "gone beyond" as well. The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out Who You Are. Ultimately the enquirER-enquirEE and the WHO AM I along with Quantum Psychology dissolve. The probability of that occurring might "hopefully" be enhanced by developing multi-dimensional awareness and by going beyond how you fixate your awareness on your False Core-False Self but there are no guarantees. Finally, it might be that through the liberation of your fixated awareness that ESSENCE, the "I AM," the underlying unity or VOID might become more realizable. At that point, the "you" "you" think you are disappears, and only THAT ONE INDIVISIBLE SUBSTANCE remains. The realization that it is all one interconnected whole, that there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE that everything is made out of, and even BEYOND this—and "I AM THAT"—is pure (no subject-object) spirituality. personality is a mis-taken identity.
