This provides an explanation of why patterns exist within seemingly random events and why successful magic often results in a chain of synchronicities. For a given subject (performing under optimum conditions and having no difficulty visualizing the nature of the experimental target nor psychological aversions to the target), the magnitudes of the results obtained in tasks to affect the readings on measuring devices (such as magnetometers, radiation detectors, Josephson effect devices, balances, etc.) can be related to one another by calculating the probability of the reading based on the standard physical principles of quantum mechanics [5]. The sporadic nature of psi phenomena can be explained as a matter of outside observers randomizing the process, causing dilution of will data channels and randomizing the results [5]. Thus, the need for secrecy in magical operations. One can no longer maintain the division between the observer and 864 observed or between consciousness and the physical world. Rather, both observer and observed, along with both consciousness and the material world, are merging and interpenetrating aspects of one whole indivisible reality [1]. Whatever the subtle level of reality underlying matter and energy, we are that (including our consciousness).
