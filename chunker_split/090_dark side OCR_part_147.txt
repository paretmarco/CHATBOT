The child is seeing the actual subtitles. The child within the adult, years later, sees subtitles with most men and feels scared. This is illusioning, taking the past subtitles and projecting them into the present. With the illusioning of mind reading, the child within illusions what is occurring. Breaking the child-to-child loop so the observer can wake-up the inner child' s trance and see present time, forces the causes of the mind reading to surface, which is scary. Principle VI: The child-to-child trance must be main- tained; the child-to-child trance must make the world conform to its image. To see the world otherwise would break the trance and bring about CHAOS. Recently, I was giving a workshop in Quantum Psychology on the East Coast. A therapist came who was trained in N.L.P.

She 90 4* The Dark Side of the Inner Child said, "It' s just like N.L.P."
