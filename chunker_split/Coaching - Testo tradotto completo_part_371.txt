Therefore, as we build the mental images, it might happen that we are going to omit some essential particulars, and that, even though the generic concept might be given effect to, the consequential results which are produced differ from the ones we had expected to witness. It is then by drawing on our memory, and by comparing what is actually unfolding to what we had desired, that one manages to realize the omissions and the mistakes we are inclined to fall into, and to accordingly centralize, so to speak, our way of conceiving and willing. After all, by scanning whatever has forced its way onto our attention for some time already, viz. the trend of our business affairs, the new people we have established contact with, the diverse occurrences we have been active participants in, and by seeking to identify the relationship they display vis-à-vis our previous moods, our learning curve will expand tremendously, and we will be able to develop that «causal sense», the sharpness of which enables us to steer our physical and psychological activity to the utmost possible level of judiciousness. The moments of relax and rest are those which are best suited to this particular exercise.
