If, however, the emotions such a person is associated with are negative in nature, he lives in a world of suffering. In order to transcend it, one can resort to expanding the context. In cases of hyper-association with a bodily sensation (meaning that the person is “victim” of the attentive focus on one part of the body), an effective method is to cause such sensation to spread throughout the body. We will initially fix our gaze upon the patient, and we will recommend the expanding of such sensation. Thereafter, we are going to act in accordance with a methodology of magnetic steps, whereupon the lateral vision will grow, and there will no longer be a tunnel vision, as that is in fact going to be replaced by an enlarged vision. It is possible to pursue, in this regard, the same path which is treaded in relation to regression into a past age in the event that images were to appear. By solving the regressions, in fact, we would bring the subject back to reality. 2.
