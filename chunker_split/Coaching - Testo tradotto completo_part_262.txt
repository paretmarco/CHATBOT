However, every plan, regardless of its proportions, will have to be established by linking it strictly both to the earlier and to the later plans, and, in particular, to the general life plan. In fact — as already stated here above — every action only draws its value and its full justification from such overall life plan. Creating this correlation is in actual fact easy: Once you have devised the largest plan, and you view it “as a movie”, it is then sufficient to “cut out” from it progressively smaller divisions. Strategy, tactics and intuition Tactics play an important role in the execution of the minor plans and the daily plan. In other words, differently from the life plan, we might be able to foresee certain elements which are not essential at the general level, and yet might avail the accomplishment of our aims. Why are tactics important? Their importance is due to the fact that they grant us the opportunity of better exploiting our available resources.
