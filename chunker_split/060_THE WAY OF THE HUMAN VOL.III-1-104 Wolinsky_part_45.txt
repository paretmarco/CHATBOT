Around ten years ago, I was in a relationship with a woman who lived in Maine. I was giving a workshop in Baltimore and she was supposed to visit me. Instead, she called and told me that not only was she not coming but she was breaking up with me. When this happened, I studied my inner process. It was like I had an internal book of rules. It was like I was looking into a book (my mind) which had been programmed to have an automatic response which I never questioned (it was in the software). It was like the rules were, break up, sudden break up, hurt, ah, yes, feel bad. And so I felt hurt and bad. I could see my unquestioned programming or my book of rules.
