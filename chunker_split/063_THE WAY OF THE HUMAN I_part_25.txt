I had compartmentalized the spiritual or quantum world, on the one hand, and the thinking, emotional and biological, on the other. It was "as if one dimension of The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness manifestation negated the other. If I were in one dimension—for example, the emotional—the awareness of the EMPTINESS or underlying unity or interconnected fullness was lost or, at best, became a memory. I soon realized that I was compartmentalizing, separating the "spiritual" from the material. Multi-dimensional Awareness, therefore, is where self actualization meets self-realization. It is where the external, thinking, emotional and biological-animal are no longer separate from the underlying unity. In short, Quantum Psychology incorporates and includes the self-actualization of the West with the self-realization of the East through Multi-dimensional Awareness. For this reason it is important to let go of idea of "health" at a thinking or emotional dimension—such as always being unconditionally loving or always forgiving—and understand that this is a not a quality or function of the thinking or emotional dimensions but is a quality of ESSENCE. In this way, we can begin to accept our biological-animal, our thinking and emotional dimensions and their "limitations."
