For fun, choose something you love to eat, something that you want to take a bite out of. In class, I ask studentss to bring their favorite treats. What I want you to do is to take a taste and put it in your mouth. Let your eyes close. You can chew it, but do everything slowly. In other words, don't just swallow it and reach for another bite. Practice: I'd like you to notice something. Now that your eyes are closed, I'd like you to focus your attention on the delightful feelings as if they were made of energy rather than a picture you might have in your mind of the object of delight. As you experience the sensations—the delightful feelings, thoughts or whatever are associated with the food you have in your mouth—I'd like you to focus your attention on these sensations. See if you can keep your attention on the delight, rather than on the object of delight. Experience the delight as energy. Gently, bring your awareness back to the room and let your eyes open. Desire: To long for; to wish for earnestly; to hope for. Desire can be described in several ways.
