What the As- The Way of the Human o Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness sociational Trance does is to shift the chaos of "not knowing" the present time reality onto a past associational reality, so that the present time is no longer a problem. For example, let's say Dad was mean, as well as tall, and I had to defend myself against him. The nervous system automatically goes into defense against tall men whether they are mean or not. Thus the associational trance robs the person of present time experience. To further illustrate, a psychologist from New York kept on assuming I was just like her husband. When she talked about Quantum Psychology she thought it was "just like" the training she was receiving. Thus, her present time chaos of "not knowing" what to do or say or what was appropriate was temporarily ordered. "I" was like her husband and "my" work was the same as hers. And so the intention in developing the first dimension of awareness of the external world is so that you can experience present-time reality without being burdened by past experiences or associations.
