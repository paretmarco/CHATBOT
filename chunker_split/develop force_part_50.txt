Since tails belong in their form, to the aqueous element, symbol in its entirety (though we do not have evidence of the matter) may easily represent the exercise that follows: from the meeting of two different aqueous energies and the energy of breathing you extract the power (represented by the sword). To do this you must work at both physical and energetic level. Dominate polarities with the hot water/cold water exercise To develop the basic energy we must therefore be able to overcome polarities. Polarities are also expressions of a dualistic vision of the world, a product of our mind and our ego that has learned to interpret the sensory data according to pre-established patterns. How many people complain constantly! Being influenced by world distinctions, beautiful/ugly, pleasant/unpleasant etcâ€¦ this means virtually to live in a reality built from the outside and based on the concepts. The magnetic man builds instead his world and his reality. Moreover, the first point where we must surpass us is in ourselves. We must be able to build our world and live our reality. A way to access each symbol is represented by the sensorial experience. A major exercise called "hot water and cold water". It consists in Dennis, Etruria, vol. ii. p. 160 This exercise is among the first, if not the first in the tradition of Virgilio t. modify perceptions, to reverse the physical polarity of perception of the water element. This exercise works physiologically to hemispheric level, since each hand is tied to a different hemisphere.
