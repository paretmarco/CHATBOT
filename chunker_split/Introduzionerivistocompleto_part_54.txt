You will open your eyes and you will see a more exciting present and you will feel definitely more in shape to immediately start a busy and inviting future that waits for you. PHOBIA TECHNIQUES (Cinema technique) The above technique is very useful for phobias and fears. It relies on the presumption that a phobia is a learning process or a block. In other words, how we interpret reality after having learned a negative suggestion. We can easily re-program mental images in order to overcome any type of phobia. “The Map isn’t the land”. Localize the traumatic event by finding it on the Time Line. Do this in a dissociated manner, without any emotional involvement. Identify a peaceful state before the event. Identify peaceful states after the event. Imagine you are in the projection room of a cinema and you are looking at the nape of the neck of another “you” sitting down in the stalls watching the film. You do not see the film being projected, you see yourself. The film is in black and white with circus music playing. The lights go on. You associate yourself as an actor and you are in the film while the montage sequences quickly rewind in color. Make the film run again in black and white (it gives an idea of oldness and has less emotional impact) while you go back to looking at the nape of your other self. Then go back to being an actor while the sequences are quickly rewound in color. Repeat various times.
