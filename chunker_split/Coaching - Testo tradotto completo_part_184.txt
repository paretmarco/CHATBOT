You might have some grandiose ideas, but you cannot move forward so as to actually implement them, unless you are able to discern, in your observation of things, the practical idea, unless you are able, that is, to concretely work out the image of the factual improvement that needs to be achieved. Educating one’s fantasy has as its consequence the building of a bridge between reality and what you desire. Whoever is devoid of imagination is the passive target of the concatenation of life’s events; as for the one regaled with imagination, by contrast, he «rapidly crosses the various stages» and attains not what he should, but rather what he would like to realize. If — say — you are a merchant, you might be one because you feel an initial impulse which is turned towards the realm of building and communicating. This primordial impulse later turns, in the sphere of practical implementations, into the idea of starting up a business.
