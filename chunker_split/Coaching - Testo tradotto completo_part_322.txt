For example, at the time of eating, all that is required would be to send a simple question to one’s body, by which we ask it to choose what is actually beneficial, without indulging in any additional thoughts, but rather taking care to keep on being present to our own selves. The natural prerequisite of such modus operandi, of course, is to have a clear connection with ourselves, and the acquisition, either spontaneously through one’s inbred nature or as a result of learning, of positive life habits, which are hygienic and beneficial, together with having conscious awareness of such nice habits. We are, in other words, enjoined to gain prior access to that particular inward “sense” whereby our own body flexibly replies to us and tells us what benefits it. In the beginning, we might make the path for such bodily response smooth by resorting to the creation of a positive image showing us how well we are going to feel if we followed the rules. The image thus conjured up and visualized is, however, especially necessary at the initial stage only. Thereafter, everything is going to unfold itself in a simple way.
