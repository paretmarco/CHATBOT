The remnants of human experience have come to form "primordial images" which are more than intellectual postulates. This is the "Archetype," a model from which all things of the same kind are made. An Archetype is a universal pattern or motif; which comes from the collective unconscious and is the basic content of religions, mythologies, legends and fairytales. It emerges in individuals in the form of dreams, visions and fantasies. Each Archetype has its own specific energy and is capable of acting upon the world. In a real sense, Archetypes, which are a phenomena of God-like dimensions, are alive and functioning in the world. They are able to produce a meaningful interpretation or to interfere in a given situation. ARCHETYPES FOR QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW For Quantum Psychology, the Archetype naturally contains remnants of psychic history with primordial images. But Quantum Psychology does not separate the Archetype from the individual. As a force both are created by the condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which yields a creation of the Collective-Archetypical dimension. It is a universal description of an occurrence not separate from either the personal or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Archetypes contain different densities of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS.
