How does s/he move the head (for example: does he nod while speaking)? Way of speaking: Is the tone of voice deep or shrill? What rhythm does his/ her voice have? Does he use slang? How quickly does he speak? If you want to establish a long-term rapport, you need to identify the things that are important to a person, or his/ her values. What you should keep in mind is to avoid discussions that could bring a difference in opinion before you have established a good rapport, otherwise, the rapport will inevitably break. Another important thing is that at the time in which the verbal conversation takes over, you need to eliminate negative terms, better known as negative expressions, because we risk sending the opposite message to what we want to send (see the explanation in the communication rapport paragraph). This refers to a normal conversation and not during a therapy session. Example: “I don’t want to lose you!” Our brain decodes the message as, “I want to lose you!” Once we have established a rapport with CNV, we should be careful about the language we use, which is normally very confused, in such a way to refine it and make it suitable to what we want to transmit. The next level consists of trying to understand what type of internal change is needed to help maintain a “rapport” in a better way.
