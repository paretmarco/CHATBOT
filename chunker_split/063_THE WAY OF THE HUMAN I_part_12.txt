This is an attempt to denote them as moving Quantum events which arise and subside. They (I, me, she, him, her) are an appearance as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condenses and thins-out, and represent only a facsimile of the nervous system. This suggests that each arising I is made of the same substance as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS; but from the space-time limitations of the nervous system the I appears to be made of a different substance than the "no-I" VOID background. I should also note that the VOID is UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (i.e., consciousness without distinctions). The "you" you call yourself (i.e., like a thought, chair, air, the observer, etc.) is differentiated consciousness. The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS appears to be differentiated when actually it has not. F, inding out who you are is not about being or becoming something, it is about first realizing your humanness. . . .
