Jung was not interested in finding out who he was; 91 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology 4.Jung did not have a "realized" teacher, someone to say, "Don't believe anything, question everything. Anything yon think you are you are not."

Hopefully the following illustration will help to clarify. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY AND ARCHETYPES 1 ) Quantum Psychology wants to go beyond the mind 2) Jung believed in the psyche and in its Archetypical representation Chapter III SPIRITUAL SYSTEMS AND ARCHETYPES When "spiritual systems" are viewed through the lens of the Physics Dimensions, they reveal what the "Spiritual" Systems and "paths" to realization are; fixations on a particular Physics dimension or force. To best illustrate this, it is important to describe the forces and Physics dimensions and their Archetypal relationship to different "Spiritual" Systems.
