I have also seen this happen with family therapists who, when the couple approaches divorce, age-regress and become the child trying to save the marriage, or become a parent telling them or imagining that they know what to do. This re-enforces the client's dependency, age-regression, and trance-ference issues as well as the therapist's trance-ference and counter-trance-ference issues. Imagine you're in a relationship. Your partner has a problem. You begin to treat them the way your parents or idealized parents (the wish) treated you. You no longer are in present time rather your partner has become the child and you are acting as your parents did to you as a childâ€”this is counter-trance-ference. This is different from and expands the traditional definition which says that The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness "Counter-transference is in large measure a counter reaction to the transference of the patient" (Marshall and Marshall, 1988, p. 59). Quantum Psychology deeply disagrees with this above statement because it implies that the patient, client or student is responsible for the therapist's or teacher's counter-trance-ference, when it might be the other way around.
