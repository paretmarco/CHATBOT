In an analogous fashion, horizontal movements stand for hearing-based constructs, while downward motions denote gaining access to our own inner dialogue or possibly to our own sensations. When the eye adopts such positions, the client is then “inside his own self” and is recreating the problem. By requesting from our client a direct and sustained eye contact, we actively intervene and melt away those parts of automatic “trances” which serve as defence mechanisms within the depth of his being. We thereby transcend the reactions which help our client defend himself from the intensity of interpersonal contact, and which allow him to recreate the symptom. 13. Acting on the symptom By establishing eye contact while our client lives out his state, moreover, we place ourselves in a position to operate in another manner as well. We can in fact increase the symptom in order to develop at that stage a two-phase process, one which first begins with an escalation and is subsequently followed by a change in the state of consciousness. Intensifying the dynamics which give birth to the relevant cluster of symptoms, in fact, is paradoxically of assistance in leading the person to a more expanded state.
