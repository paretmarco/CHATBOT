This is an aspect which is not even taken into consideration by the traditional schools, and yet has an essential role to play, since we gather our will through the way we look. The purely organic and cellular part of the being does not only need to be developed. It must in fact also be subjected to the control of the will, as the latter equally represents a manifestation of thought, in its material, physical, practically applied aspect. The base of the spinal column is the departure point of such energy, and is symbolically linked to the sign of the Aries, as a way of emphatically underlining the primal force which is located in it. The very same concept is also present in the Indian notion of kundalini. A Western symbol of comparable power is the caduceus, with its two snakes wrapping themselves around a rod. Such symbol (which by the way has been adopted by a number of medical orders) directs attention towards the solar end lunar (masculine end feminine) energies which wrap themselves up around the central column. Will bears the meaning of willing action. It denotes manifestation.
