On the basis of the aforesaid, two distinct ways of creating such synergy arise: The rhythm of oscillation, as a result of which greater power is brought about by alternating activities and methods of action that act on different parts of the brain; The power of wedding these varied energies, This ensures that even greater power materializes in the scenario where the whole of our being acts simultaneously in a coordinated manner. This principle of alternation and conjunction of diverse energies is one of the keys to success. We are enjoined to link together reason and intuition, and alternate activity and rest. Such a “dual dimension” is strictly connected with the development of all our energies. Vitality, too, depends on a rhythm of oscillation. It depends, that is, on the establishment of a balance between the voluntary and the involuntary systems, between the conscious and the unconscious. Developing a surplus potential If we own surplus capital, we can then invest it. The same holds true of vital energy. The more we develop energy, the greater our capacity to venture into new directions.
