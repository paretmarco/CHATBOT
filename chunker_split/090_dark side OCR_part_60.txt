This is the process of age regression. Here is another example. The little girl who sits on Daddy's lap and learns how to "be cute" so Daddy will buy her a new dress, is that same little girl who is sitting on Hubby' s lap being cute so that she gets what she wants. These are exactly the same inner-child trance experiences. The trance of age regression allows that phe- nomenon, the present-time adult becoming a past-time child, to manifest itself in the present. You construct your experience using the process of age regres- sion by altering subjectively how you experience the present. The job is to awaken from your dream shifting, from being the child in Age Regression â€¢ 35 past time, to being the observer/creator of your experience in present time. Once awakened from the inner child's trance, re- sources of the present become available to you which were not available to the child. When the trance is unglued, present-time problems lose power. The last trance example, called "being cute," had become a perma- nent fixture of her experience. Her trance worked as a survival mechanism.
