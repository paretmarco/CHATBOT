I was interested in developing a system that incorporates both (a) the ability to de-hypnotize oneself while (b) staying connected to life. To do this I incorporated a major concept of quantum physics: the observer of an internal experience is also participating in the internal subjective creation of that experience. In my earlier work, Quantum Consciousness, this was explored in depth. In Where It All Began for Me 4, 11 essence, the observer of a trauma creates his/her response to the trauma. This often creates a wounded, traumatized child who uses trance states like "going numb" to survive. The child within me had erected strategies to handle life situations. The problem was that the child within my adult self was creating internal experiences outside my awareness that did not fit my present-time reality. A system of self-awareness began to evolve for me. I began to feel free of unwanted behaviors and emotions that had been sug- gested by the child within the adult. Later chapters take an in-depth look at the trances of the inner child, the time frozen creation and identity within the adult.
