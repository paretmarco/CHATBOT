This pre-imagination is an intention to engage in an action, and the equivalent of a state of channelling energy, which lets our inward being know what it should be doing. In that manner, the response or the act will be carried out very rapidly, so rapidly that no time will be available for external incitements to interpose themselves in the narrow interstice between the thought and the response or the act. It is however important to plan in relation to a goal. Besides, such goal will only be a firm one if it is connected with our beings. The real man always knows what he wants (Tao Te King) It is the realization of our ideal which grants firmness and prevents subsequent dispersions. One can possibly assert that constructive, hence useful, action, is only that action which rests on one’s life plan. That, of course, does not mean that we have to identify ourselves with such goal. In every moment, we must always be present to ourselves, so that we are in a position to relate every life event to ourselves, by for instance “pouring that event into us”, and by possibly discovering new possibilities in the process.
