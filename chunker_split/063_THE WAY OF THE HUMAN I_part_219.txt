In short, "our" psychology and the external world try to get us to overcome the body with the thinking and emotional dimensions. For example, overworking, poor air and water—not to mention the socialization process which thwarts our biology and creates greater dissociation. Simply put, modern day time pressures put more of an emphasis on psychology and force a loss of awareness of the body. However, years of body focus can yield BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION. What is BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION? It is the realization that "your" body is made of the same substance as everything else and there is no separate individual body. In order for THAT explosion of awareness—that your body is made of the same substance as everything else—to be stabilized, and not just be an experience that comes and goes, it might be helpful if the BIOLOGICAL CORE were also stabilized. 134 Chapter Viii But what is the BIOLOGICAL CORE? It's the core of your physical being which extends from your cranium to your pelvic floor and which holds the body up. The BIOLOGICAL CORE is a biological awareness and a felt sense. It is the alignment between the gravitational pull of the sun and the earth.
