APPLICATIONS OF FASCINATION TO HYPNOTIC PRACTICE 1. Hypnotic fascination and Instant Hypnosis Through the use of fascination, one can produce a high state of receptiveness which is geared towards a subsequent actualization of hypnotic phenomena or towards paving the way for some lethargy-type hypnosis where the subject appears “to be sleeping” That is not all, however. Some people believe, in so doing following Braid’s view, that the eyes represent no more than two shining points which entice the subject’s attention. The truth is that the effect produced by the eyes is far more extensive than the mere observation of a physical object. What one is in fact dealing with is a state on its own. In the past, the state of fascination, which is not recognized as being a distinct state by many authors, has been also referred to by the phrases “state of credulity” and “suggestions while the eyes are wide open”. If we proceed to analyze it, nevertheless, we will realize that we are dealing with a phenomenology which is quite detached from the idea of hypnosis that is ordinarily linked to sleep and which, in the view of some people, is a “cultural construct”. 2.
