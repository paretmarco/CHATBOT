Tommaso Campanella accordingly advised to keep the eyebrows lifted up and the eyes opened, so that the spirit might flow out (Campanella, “De sensu rerum”, Book IV, chapter XV, 326). Other writers, too, had discerned that truth, as well as the fact that, for instance, people in love tended to enlarge both the spirit and the eyes (Cf. Fracastor, “Sympath.”, Chapter XXIII, 139). In our own practice, we have always noticed that the greater is the white part of the eyes, the greater is the influence that is perceived. A larger opening of the eyes, moreover, enables more elements in the pupil to get reflected. [27] Each person has a specific configuration of eyelids and eyelashes. Every one among us, accordingly, possesses a position of the eyes which best suits the beauty of his eyes, comparatively with all other positions. You have to devise clever ways to discover such position, and turn it into one which is instinctive and familiar to your own person.
