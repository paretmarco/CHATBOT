The non-verbal I AM is the No-state-state; it is non-verbal pure being. It is the root, or as Nisargadatta Maharaj said, the seed of individual consciousness. Without it there can be no individual psychology, i.e., it occurs or is naturally realized when you do not use your thoughts, memories, emotions, perceptions or associations, and is pure being. However, there is no awareness of the VOID. The I AM is the deepest archetype of the Collective. The Seventh Dimension is the COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS or THE ARCHETYPICAL DIMENSION (Volume III). It contains the basic substance which connects us all. It also contains the archetypes which are made and produced by the physics dimensions and forces, i.e., energy, space, mass, time, gravity, light, electromagnetics, strong and weak nuclear forces, etc. 20 Chapter The Eighth Dimension is THE NOT-I-I (see Volume III). It is Pure Awareness. It is formless. It is aware of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which surrounds us and yet is a part of it. It is pure WITNESSING, beyond the observer-observed dyad. The WITNESS, or Pure Awareness, rests between I AM and the VOID.
