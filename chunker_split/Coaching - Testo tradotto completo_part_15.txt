The truth is that, when we are present, synchronicity is brought into being; we might thereupon be able to understand through the medium of signs and circumstances, the exact nature of which is unveiled to us, and our intuition might discern the direction which our ideal should face, and which ideal we ought to head for. If we then clearly resolve upon moving in that direction, we might become capable of avoiding the danger of being swept along by life, by the becoming of events, nay, we might succeed in attaining a position of control over the same. When that takes place, programming turns into a way in which we think about the present better, in so far as it empties the mind of the future; provided that, once the direction for our day has been set, we stay present as much as possible. In that event, the Universe will begin to respond to us and even to help us move further than what our self might have ever imagined.
