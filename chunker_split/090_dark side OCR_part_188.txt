Type II â€” Hypersensitive Distortion The second type of sensory distortion, hypersensitivity, is illustrated by a woman who felt hypersensitive in groups of people. She experienced rapid sensations in her heart and chest. As in the first type of sensory distortion, the speeding up or slowing down of sensations altered her subjective experience. She imagined people were thinking bad thoughts of her. Once again I asked her to create a sensation and notice the space, and create another sensation and Sensory Distortion + 119 notice the space. In this way, the observer took charge of creating the sensations. Another style of hypersensitivity comes from cognitive therapy and is called Personalizing. Personalizing is the tendency to relate everything around you to yourself. A recently married man thinks that every time his wife talks about tiredness she means she is tired of him. A man whose wife complains about rising prices hears the complaints as attacks on his ability as a breadwinner. A major aspect of personalizing is the habit of comparing yourself to others. He' s dumb, I'm smart. The underlying assumption is that your worth is questionable.
