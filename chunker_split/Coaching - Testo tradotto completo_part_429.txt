The people we meet in life are in a “trance”: They dream of an imaginary future, without analyzing whether they can in fact reach it, alternatively, they “do as they see others doing”, and so on and so forth. Let us take for instance what advertising does. It creates a link with dreams. We buy, for example, a particular product, because we are “fascinated” and “involved” by a certain advert or by fashion, which generates in us a lack of ability to engage in a logical critique. Thereafter, we think we have purchased something on the basis of its usefulness. Therefore, it happens quite frequently that, when we accept an idea which establishes a link with our “trance”, we subsequently rationalize that idea and persuade ourselves that our choice to embrace it was actually the fruit of some logical process. The faculty of being able to choose is only active in that man who is present. Whoever is less present is usually in a “trance”, as a passive victim of his thoughts.
