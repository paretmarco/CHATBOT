Looking at the inner emptiness represents the more sedate side of what would normally be called chaos and became my own next stage of development. I explored the newly emerging "theory of chaos," born of physics, and its application to the field of psychol- ogy and self help. My upcoming book is about looking at chaos as it reflects our daily problems and solutions, hence its title, The Tao of Chaos. Tao is the Chinese term for "The Way," or the way of chaos. In this book, along with my earlier works, Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology, and Quantum Con- sciousness: The Guide to Experiencing Quantum Psychology, we looked at identities, roles, trances and their relationships to psychol- ogy, physics, and religions. The Tao of Chaos will provide methods and approaches to embrace chaos and its sister, the void, as means to discovering a deeper sense of who we are without resistance.
