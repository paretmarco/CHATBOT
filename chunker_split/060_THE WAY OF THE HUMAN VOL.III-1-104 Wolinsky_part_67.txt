In this way, once the False Core-False Self, which you acquired, is dismantled and gone beyond—ESSENCE naturally is realized. In this way ESSENCE is and becomes not only the repository of the Essential Qualities of ESSENCE, and the answer to the No-Core—Walse Core---►False Self dilemma, it also completes the narcissistic injury and the shock of the Realization of Separation. In this way separation, while also the Essential Quality of unity with "another," can be realized and stabilized through the completion of the preliminary and preparatory practise of dismantling the False Core—False Self. This unites us with our Essential Core and its delicious quali- ties. ________________ here is no self or imagined self which is sepa- rate from the lens it looks through.The self is part of the lens, arises and subsides with the lens, and is contained within the lens itself. The I AM is beyond this imagined self and its imagined separate lens. The I AM is even beyond the knower of the self-lens complex. T he NON-VERBAL 1,4M is the gift of Nisargadatta Maharaj. It is pure being prior to ESSENCE with its Essential qualities.
