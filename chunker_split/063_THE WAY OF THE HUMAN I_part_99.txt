But if you believe there is a "bad" part of the False Core-False Self and you try to focus on the "good" part, you keep the Chapter II with the omniscient magical mommy, and represents the teacher's grandiosity and counter-transeference. Likewise, a system or technique can be imagined to do it all. The occurs when the system or technique becomes magical mommy or the tranformational object (technique) of the pre-verbal nonrepresentational infant (see Volume I, The Special Section, Trances People Live: Revisited). Quantum Psychology has some very clear weak suits. One of them is the external world. The other is the physical body, although the work itself does contain a lot of enquiry directed at the body. The body needs a "hands on" approach. Body-work should deal with what Ida Rolf calls the BIOLOGICAL CORE (see Chapter VIII). Secondly, "bodywork" is needed in order to process and address the material in the physical body. For these reasons, Quantum Psychology recommends that people get some hands-on "body-work."
