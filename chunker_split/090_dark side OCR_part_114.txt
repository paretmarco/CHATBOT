Principle III: The resisting identity, when not in conflict with the fused identity, "Dad," will tend to fight the fused identity "Dad" outside themselves, whether present or imagined, and resist the imaginary Dad (fused identity). This is clearly the trance of trance-ference. Transference, which is a major part of the psychoanalytic model of Sigmund Freud, briefly states that the client projects the parent on the therapist and then treats the therapist like Mom or Dad. In this example, the rebel side of the inner child trance-fers Mom/Dad on to an authority figure, whether it is there or not, and begins to resist the authority figure. The difference is, in this model, 70 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child the adult does not transfer or project Mom and Dad onto an authority figure; it is the inner child who is the culprit, trance-ferring images of Mommy and Daddy on people and acting like a little kid expecting to be taken care of. Transference is a trance of the inner child because the child goes into a trance and transfers Mom and Dad on others. This makes present time into past time, hence, trance-ference.
