By keeping a watchful eye on the different elements that make up the plan, you will establish the minimum programming of its future activities, taking care, in the process, especially to fulfil the need to maintain harmony between all its parts. What is required at this stage is not that one should establish in full detail what he would like to do from the day in question until the end of his life, but, rather more simply, to trace the direction he is going to face henceforth. If such a general orientation will be a reliable reflection of our inward being, we might then decisively promise ourselves never to deflect from it. Each one of us is in fact born with certain innate generic tendencies. Opposing such tendencies will result in rendering them barren. By contrast, to set up conditions which favour the development of such connatural predispositions means we are going to make ourselves useful to others in the best possible manner and, at the same time, secure a happy life for ourselves. Having recourse to some elucidating examples, we might say that no skinny person will dream of becoming an athlete, nor will a natural musical talent imagine his self reaching felicity by working as a mining engineer.
