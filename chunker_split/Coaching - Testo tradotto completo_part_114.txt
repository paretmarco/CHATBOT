We must take good care to observe that it is by no means necessary that this worry should be etched in your mind in a clear shape. That is not a must. It is enough if it lends a special tone to your entire activity, or, we should rather say, your sensibility. This endless unconscious thought resembles a definite hue which colours the field of your mental side. There is no doubt that, in order for one to truly manage how not to think about anything, it is necessary to first learn how to rid oneself even of this thought-non-thought, how to expunge it as if one might erase through a rubber the marks left by chalk on a blackboard, and how to set oneself in a neutral, indifferent state, the one which the Greeks used to term ataraxia.
