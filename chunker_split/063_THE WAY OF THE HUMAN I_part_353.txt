It should also be noted that most people are adults in present time but, at varying points or situations, they often become age-regressed. However, I have met integrated age-regressed people who are never adults in present time but are always acting and seeing the world as children. I saw a woman for therapy who always expected her husband and the universe (her husband-daddy-mommy) to "take care" of her. This so eclipsed her life that she would not work even 227 he Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness hough they had little money. This was an age-regressed trance-ference of parents on her husband and on the world. It is appropriate to expect your parents to provide for you, but the New Age "the universe (morn/dad) will provide" or "take care of me" is an integrated age-regressed philosophy. In India, we used to say, "It is true that the universe will take care of you, but it might not take care of you the way you want or imagine that you should be taken care of." Why do some people become the age-regressed child while others the all-knowing adult?
