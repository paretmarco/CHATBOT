The child within is attracted to the familiar scene, even though the adult knows better; and the observer sleeps. Interpretive Distortion One example of kinesthetic blocking-out, (See Chapter 13, Sensory Distortion) can occur in an interpretive experience. For example, in cases of child abuse the child might at first experience the abuse painfully. As the experience is repeated again and again, the child might begin to interpret physical or emotional abuse as pleasurable, affectionate or loving. Interpretative distortion consti- tutes a subtle form of kinesthetic blocking-out, not feeling what is there. This interpretation explains an individual' s addictions to emotionally and physically abusive relationships. It is no surprise that children who were sexually abused either abuse others or get abused as adults. The child within assumes that forced sex and abuse are love, affection, or worse yet, the "way it is." I had a client who, for several years of her marriage, was raped by her husband. Her gynecologist asked her if she had been raped, because there was so much vaginal tearing. Although she didn't enjoy the experience, she interpreted it as "the way it is."
