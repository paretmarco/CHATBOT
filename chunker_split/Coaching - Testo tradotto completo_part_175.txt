Every human being is unique, and what is fine for an individual is not necessarily suitable to a different person. We must be able to keep to the ground, and simultaneously find our own dimension. The key to that is to be present, that is, to enlarge our consciousness as much as we can, until we are eventually able to be in communion with harmony. So long as we are present, our feeling will not be deceitful. When we are present, we are able to discover our true dimension, either through the help of a profound intuition, or by deducing it from the things which surround us, thanks to a look which is grounded on presence. There are in fact some accumulations of reality which, once perceived, might help us comprehend the direction that should be taken and further developed. We must realize the direction that is ensconced in things. Understanding oneâ€™s own direction is tantamount to get a better understanding of the Universe and of ourselves within that Universe. Every man, each one according to his idiosyncratic nature and his specific culture, unconsciously formulates in his mind a purpose which he makes his own.
