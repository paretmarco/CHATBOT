Even such phrases as “I can’t do it”, or “I am unable to bring it off”, will progressively shed their meaning, since we will be more present in the reality and less so in our own thoughts. At that stage, we will then begin to align our actions with our decisions more and more. By proceeding along such a path, in addition, we will eventually reach the point where we will no longer have sensory preferences which are lived out in an automatic fashion. Some people see all the time, others are constantly audial persons, etc. By attaining presence, we will gradually reach a state of balance and “loosening” of any mental automatism 36. THE PROCESS OF SUBORDINATING AUTOMATISM TO CONSCIOUSNESS – The process of self-development passes through the prerequisite of establishing a total alignment between the decisions one takes and the resultant actions. Every person is in fact capable of noticing that inside his being there are two elements which inspire actions, two primal sources from which decisions gush out. On the one there is conscience, judiciousness, reason, reflection; on the other hand we find automatism.
