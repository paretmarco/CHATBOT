When you eventually feel you are immersed in a state of perfect calm, you will have to focus your mind on the thought that your look becomes exquisite, luminous, glowingly bright, and that in future other people cannot but concur that what you are busy thinking in that connection is actually true. You will have, in other words, to perceive yourself as already endowed with a particular look, whichever one you might happen to crave for. Take care to fall asleep with this thought. In the morning, when you wake up, you will undoubtedly still recall the self-persuasion of the previous night. You are encouraged in that instance to confirm it to your own self, in the invariable sense we have alluded at, i.e. not merely desiring for yourselves, but rather believing yourselves to be already factually endowed with the look you prefer, and thus imagining its manifold effects, agreeable consequences, etc. Exercise 20. Always keep the eyes wide open [26] While following the said advice — especially at home — one must make sure that the eyes are not opened widely with an astonished look. On the contrary, the sight must be sharp and expressive.
