They appear spiritual, but deep clown they feel as though they have nothing and are nothing. (Small nothing as in a lack.) This premature detachment actually is a defense. In other words, they look detached, but it is a defense against feeling. After living in India for six years and traveling and visiting with almost sixty teachers, ashrams, and gurus, I met many spiritual aspirants who were acting-out this schizoid process. They oftentimes had high cheekbones, a brittle bony structure and, in extreme cases, a film or coating over their eyes. When I looked into their eyes, even though they kept making lots of eye contact, I was unable to pierce through this covering. Very dissociative, and aloof, and appearing spiritual, the schizoid individual is terrified of engulfment, remaining very defensively detached as a defense against their underlying age-regressed fear; hence, to defend against feeling, they become over-observers. A by-product of meditation is dis-association, but it can be used as a way of "spiritualizing dissociation, and using meditation as medication." Dissociation or premature observation is an automatic defense that protects you during trauma.
