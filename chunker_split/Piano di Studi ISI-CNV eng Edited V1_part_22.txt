Register of mental states and possible informations: determining the number of possible states, that is the starting point for quantum operations and the creation of a coherent superposition. At this point, our unconscious mind can begin to operate 3. Interference from one item to the other: the act of an element on the set of transformations (calculations) quantum. Examples of interference are for example those made by symbolic elements. 4. Quantum Correlation/Entanglement: the fact that the two elements can come into contact and subsequently maintain a ratio (entanglement) between them. This concept applies even to magnetism, where people entangle at a distance and create distant reactions 5. Equilibrium/Balance is the central position that eliminates dissipative situations 6. Amplification of mental coherence The use of elements and rhythms that amplify the extreme quantum mode. 7. Reducing information: the reduction of the amount of information to a single element 8. Implicated order and explicate order: the two positions 9. Coherence and Decoherence of neuronal information: We need concentration. For a quantum computation can take place it is essential that the information remains consistent and is not lost to the environment 10. Holographic Model: the holographic model is essential to constitute a theory of learning and information retrieval. Approach implies a "top-down". 11. Presence and consciousness and their relationship with the implicate order. Presence can be a pathway to accede to the implicate order starting from the explicate order 12. Phase and Frequency: The information you have the same phase can be combined more easily.
