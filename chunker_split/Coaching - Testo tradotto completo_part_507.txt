Finally, apart from enlarging the time perspective and creating realistic sequences of mutually related connections, we must also have knowledge of what we should be doing. First of all, in order to help our mind function well, it would be an excellent thing to create for ourselves different types of strategies which are tailor-made for every separate directionality of the market (lateral, bullish, and bearish). It is only possible to test the effectiveness of our strategies through the medium of a “back testing”, which is going to span at least 5 to 10 years of market activity. The strategies must then be applied across different time frames (5 to 15 minutes, 1 hour, a day, a week, a month); that is essential to the purpose of establishing the right timing to enter the market. It would be appropriate to have the opportunity of simultaneously watching on a screen a graphic relating to, respectively, one hour, a single day, a week and a full month. That will be of assistance to us in determining the right time to get into the market.
