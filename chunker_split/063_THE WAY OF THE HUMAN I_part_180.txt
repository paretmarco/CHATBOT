to be as they are, namely energy, the "experience" transmutes (reorganizes) itself. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If you are trying to get rid of feelings you place a judgment, evaluation, and significance placed upon them and are resisting them. It should be noted that the experience of "pure energy" is much closer to the quantum level because energy is an "earlier" manifestation of the condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS than are the labels anger, sadness, joy, etc. Descriptions, stories, beliefs about what experiences "mean" take us further away from the quantum level (to be discussed later). The purpose of the following practices is to help you to allow for the transmutation of all your experiences so that thinking and emotional energies tied-up and collapsed can be experienced as energy. In this way you will free your awareness and become more aware of the quantum level or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. The basic idea of placing your attention on the emotion comes from the Vijnana Bhairava, which is one of the major texts in Kashmir Shaivism. It contains dharanas (how to affixate awareness), which are Tantric practices.'
