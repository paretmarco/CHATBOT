H. H. Dalai Lama RAMANA MAHARISHI REVISITED Looking back at Ramana Maharishi's "Who Am I," we can begin to explore it at yet a deeper level. Originally, Maharishi said, "Whenever a thought arises ask, 'Who am I?' or 'Who is this IT and the thought disappears." THE NEXT STEP Step I:Notice an "I" thought. Step II:Notice the knower or experiencer of the "I" thought. Step III:Notice what occurs when "you say," "What knower is knowing this?" The knower (experiencer) and known (experience) disappear. Why? Because you go beyond the knower-known, experiencer-experience dyad, and there is NO-YOU and NO-I. 171 "The NOT-I-I" Contemplate: 1. That all information (knowledge) is without cause. (Singh) 2. The possibility that this information (knowledge) does not belong to me personally. (Singh) I'm using the words "knowledge" and "information" interchangeably here so that either suggests anything you know about yourself or the world. This view is suggested because in the Siva Sutras it says, "Knowledge is bondage."
