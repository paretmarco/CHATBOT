For example, we might be in a conversation with somebody, let's say a lover, and all of a sudden we go into a fantasy about their breaking up with us. That fantasy moves us from a present time relationship of the external dimension into our thinking dimension. We lose our present time reality. In Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology, I call that going into a trance and losing present time reality. What happens when we do that is we no 83 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness longer see the person in present time, but rather we have, and relate to, an idea we have about them. We (the nervous system) infer and abstract, omitting certain things and selecting out others, becoming ultimately dominated by the thinking world over the present time experience of the external world. The noted father of General Semantics, Alfred Korzybski, would have said, "The map is not the territory." In Quantum Psychology terms, this means you have an idea or an inference about the external world which is not the external world.
