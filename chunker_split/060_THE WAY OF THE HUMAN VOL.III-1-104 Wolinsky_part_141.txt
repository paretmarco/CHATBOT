For example, let's imagine your mother is crazy and you resist it. So in your relationship with her there's a lot of repressed anger. You then create an internalized "good, all knowing" mother as a defense against the "crazy" mother. But this good mother is not an Archetype since an Archetype is a direct flow formed from the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. If I am going from VOID to form to greater form, creating a dissociative form or repression of form—this is not an Archetype. It can be said that the handling of unwanted stimuli (crazy mother) through dissociation and spiritualization is universal. Still, its last departure point is not from the COLLECTIVE but from the personal "I." To determine whether it is an Archetype or repressed spiritualization—ask "yourself," Where was its departure point? Archetypes arise as direct condensations of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Spiritual-dissociation arises from greater condensation, dissociation and repression of the personal unconscious, yielding greater rigidity of character, more rules, more defenses and in a word, False spirituality, laden with dogma, rules and ritual.
