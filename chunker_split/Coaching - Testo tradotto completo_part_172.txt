What one needs to know, therefore, is not whether he can fulfil his commitment, but whether he can bind himself by it in the first place. The truth, indeed, is that “lacking sufficient time” is a complaint which is voiced in the main by those who do not carry out any work at all. Being able to accomplish something is always dependent on two variables: 1) Our own energy, and 2) our organizational aptitude. What we are going to do Once we have learnt how to attain mastery over our own selves, and having practically assimilated the art of clearing up the field of our activity by removing from it the entire spectrum of useless actions and frantic agitations, thereby eliminating those emotions which pose the risk of blocking us, we must try and understand how to act in time. We must plan our day beforehand, and be conscious of what we do in the course of it, in such a manner that we can extract from it the maximum possible result and the highest possible level of satisfaction.
