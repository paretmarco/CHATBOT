This interrupts the inner child' s anger and blaming of the outside world, by forcing the adult to look at what need he has that isn't being met, acknowledged or mentioned. Blaming There is such a relief in knowing who's to blame. If you are suffering, someone must be responsible....Blaming often involves making someone responsible for choices and decisions that are actually your own responsibility. In blame systems (trances), somebody is always doing it to you, and you have no responsibility to assert your needs, say no, or go elsewhere for what you want. (McKay, 1981:23) 28 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child Of course getting a person to directly ask for what she wants from her partner or spouse is difficult, because the dark side of the wounded inner child wants to get without asking. Asking is too vulnerable, too risky, because the child was punished for being open. Often times, parents give suggestions like, "Who do you think you are?" "Do you think money grows on trees."
