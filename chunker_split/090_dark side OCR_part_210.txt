To explain further, most children will idealize their parents. Eventually, people realize that their parents are just people, with good and bad qualities. This would end the second process of idealizing, and the person would probably not spiritualize. If, however, the infant within the adult still has this developmental gap and is, hence, developmentally delayed, and they continue idealizing others they will enter the third process of spiritualization of SUPER-IDEALIZING. Below are the types, problem states, and trances of spiritualiza- tion. The Infant Trance In the third level of spiritualization, the adult is hypnotized by the infant's magical thinking. This becomes a major cognition for people who get involved with magic, and who think they can create or influence others. For example in workshops I am asked "Don't you think thoughts create reality?" To meet this level of magical thinking or grandiosity disguised in a spiritual philosophy, I ask the group, "How many people have you thought about having sex with?" I let them think about that. "Now, how many people have you had sex with? Notice the discrepancy. If thought creates reality, it' s a poor means of creation."
