Here is how it should be done: In the exercise of the wall, the look will be required to race as fast as possible from one corner of the wall to the other; as regards the exercise of the rotation of the look, the spiral will need to be traced at an ever growing velocity; when it comes to the exercise of the line, such line will still have to be followed backward and forward, but no longer with increasing slowness, rather, at a constantly accelerated pace; and finally, as far as the exercise of the book is concerned, the lines must be covered very quickly, as if in a the flash of a lightning. Exercise 18. The restless eyes As we emulate – we would be tempted to say – a suspicious individual, you should move your eyes continuously and restlessly, thrusting your look upwardly, to the right and to the left, indeed, in every possible direction, and you should do so as rapidly as you can possibly manage, for a time span of 5 to 10 minutes.
