o Some scientists are content with the hypothesis that there is no more subtle structure than the probability waves described by quantum mechanics; and reality, at its most basic level, has a large amount of randomness whose limits are described by the quantum mechanical wave function, making the wave function itself the fundamental reality. This is called the probability doctrine. It asserts that such indetermination is a property inherent in nature and not merely a profession of our temporary ignorance, from which we expect to be relieved by a future better and more complete theory [2]. o Einstein speculated that there must be some underlying mechanism, some hidden variables, that uniquely determines the outcome of the interactions quantum theory can only statistically predict. o J.S. Bell showed mathematically that, if such a mechanism exists, and the math of quantum mechanics is strictly correct, hidden variables must not have any functional dependence on the separation of events in space and time [3]. o According to David Bohm, from both a consideration of the meaning of the mathematical equations and from the results of experiments, particles can be understood as projections of a higher-dimensional reality.
