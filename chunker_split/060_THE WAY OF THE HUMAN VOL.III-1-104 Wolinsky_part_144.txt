The shift from God as "Him" to God as "Her" is a further dissociation and defense against the shock of the Realization of Separation. The identification and fusion with DAD as the perfect model or "how to" get MOM to fuse and be one with you, later becomes the path. Unfortunately, this "spiritual path" can sometimes take you further away from the pain of the shock and from the realization of separation and the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator. In this way, you dissociate further from your humanity and further from stabilizing in ESSENCE-I AM, etc. The search for enlightenment, Heaven and the cessation of pain can be either Archetypical or a spiritualized False Self created to overcome the False Core which is biologically based. The biology is compulsively trying to survive and overcome pain. . . . The Way of the Human e Beyond Quantum Psychology CONCLUSION "To find out who you are you must first find out who you are not." Nisargadatta Maharaj Why explore Archetypes as manifestations of the Physics Dimension? Because unquestioned Archetypesâ€”be they "spiritual" or "psychological" are still condensations of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.
