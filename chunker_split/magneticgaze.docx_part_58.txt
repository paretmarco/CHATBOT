Utilization of Fascination in Therapeutic practices: Therapeutic treatment by the look Let God bless my eye, And my eye will bless all I see; I will bless my neighbor And my neighbor will bless me (Incantation from the Isle of Skye) [34] Look is a natural form of hypnotic inducement (Shore) [35]. One of our masters, Prof. Erminio from Pisa, was able to heal diseases and overcome physical problems even through the look alone. He was gifted with an unbelievable rapidity, so that, within the space of a few seconds, he would succeed in extirpating every symptom of such disorders. He had been left as the only surviving practitioner of such a bewildering technique in the whole of Italy. Moved by curiosity, we have then discovered a particular form of utilization of fascination in the therapeutic field: “Therapeutic treatment by resorting to the look”. During the Middle Ages, the word “bewitcher” was used to refer to a person who was acquainted with the technique of magnetism and fascination. In those days, the expressions “looking upon favourably” and “treating well” or “giving a gift” were interchangeable synonyms.
