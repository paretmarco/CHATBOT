De-hypnosis allows the memory to become background, allowing present time to be foreground. Discovering your inner child and the trance that holds problems in place is crucial. Then the experience can be worked with so that responsibility can shift to the observer, the creator of the inner child. Your task is to observe and appreciate your inner child' s trance, that you probably would have called your problem or symptom. Since the trance was used as a survival mechanism in your family of origin, we call it a "family trance" because you as a child were the subject and your parents the hypnotists. Individuals have learned to survive by utilizing trance skills in their families. Children who don't obey the family trance can be labeled "bad" or "troublemak- ers." People go into trances not knowing, for instance, that they are acting like a child.
