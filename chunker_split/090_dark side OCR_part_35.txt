As the child gets older, the trance (a) generalizes to all people or all women rather than Mom, so that the adult behaves like a little boy or girl around women, and (b) since it worked so well as a child, years later the observer puts the trance on automatic so the adult doesn't think about how to react anymore. In this way a situation is not experienced as it is. Rather the adult, acting like a child, takes the family with him, inside, in present time, projecting it outward on others, or keeping it inside (talking to him/herself). The trance of the dark side of the inner child acts independent of present time and is the vehicle or messenger of the child within the adult. Once the inner child is frozen, it tends to shrink the focus of attention of the adult so as to produce inevitable feelings, thoughts, emotions, and for the most part, discomfort. Trance is the major glue that holds problems together. The inner child stuck in an abusive situation might disconnect from Father, so he/she doesn't have to feel the pain of the situation.
