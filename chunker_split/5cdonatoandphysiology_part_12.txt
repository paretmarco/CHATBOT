As Morselli tells us: 'Donatism" is a complex phenomenon and a little different from classical hypnotism and Braidism, which, for the most part, bring about unconsciousness, amnesia, Says Dr. Moll: "As I saw in Paris, Donato uses a particular process to bring about the state of fascination. This process aims at a primary forced contracture of all the muscles of the body, in order, by this means, to limit the voluntary movements as much as possible. In this case the eyes of the hypnotist and the subject are firmly fixed on one another. The subject finally follows every movement of the experimenter. If he goes backward, the subject follows; if he comes forward, the subject does the same. In the same way the latter imitates every movement of the experimenter, only on the condition, however, that he knows he is intended to do so. We see here, as in the above third experiment, that fascination may be a primary form of hypnosis. But it can also be originated secondarily out of the other hypnotic states; and this is more usual.
