Get used to carry out the work you have to do with the utmost precision, with the utmost scrupulousness. A perfect work never has to be done anew VII. Always have the desire to see the fruit of your work embodied in concrete results, whether they consist in points jotted down in writing, recorded notes, contracts which have been concluded, etc, as if you were under an obligation to show at once to other people that you have truly engaged in some work. VIII. Carry out immediately those works you might be able to finish without delay. Deferring them or scheduling them for the future exposes you to the risk of wasting more time than you would have otherwise consumed in implementing them. IX. Beware of interruptions. Every time you have to resume your attention and concentration will cost you time and energy (The experts put such refocusing at 7 minutes). It is better to go through “longer sessions” of work than through several short ones. X. We need to learn not only to do things well, but also to do them rapidly (without, however, a concomitant inward haste).
