Some may be localized, as we are (such as other biological intelligences, plant divas, power spot spirits, some deities, etc. ); and some may be non localized (spirit animals in the other world, some deities, etc.). 865 The personalities of the Gods, Goddesses and spirits that many practitioners of religion relate to can also be thought of as consciousness resonance matrices. They can be very non-specific and disperse, or very specific (such as the Orishas and other deities that can manifest in full possession of those who invoke them). QUANTUM MECHANICS AND MAGICAL RITUAL Consider a typical structure of magical ritual and its quantum mechanical explanation: o Purify one's mind and one's surroundings, freeing them of interfering resonances, quieting the static so that one can get a clear and strong resonance on the target desired. o Achieve a non-localized state of consciousness, often by resonating ones mind with ones inner being, with the Earth, the sky, and ones surroundings. o Meditate on the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) representing non-local essences. This helps your mind to resonate powerfully non-locally.
