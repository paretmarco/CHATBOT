For example, a mother might suggest that her son or daughter be a certain way. The child then incorpo- rates Mom' s voice inside to remind himself how to be an adult, how to act. The suggestions were offered by the parents, siblings, etc., and were taped as truths. Problems arise when these voices are still talking, even though present circumstances do not fit the instruc- tions given by the mother in past time. Another illustration of self-talk is this: A child is told he doesn't understand how to operate the television. The child is offered suggestions by the parent, like "You don't understand," which the child decides to incorporate into his taped belief system. The child generalizes the belief about TVs to other mechanical devices, like cars, VCRs, computers. The observer creates an inner child which fuses with the suggestions made from the parent. He takes the suggestions on, as his own. Years later, the self-talk continues, and as the adult attempts to fix something, the inner child pushes the play button and a voice says, " I don't understand mechanical things."
