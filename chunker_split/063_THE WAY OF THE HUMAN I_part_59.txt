To illustrate, if three people got in a car accident, one might say "I'm was in a car accident, it means I must be worthless." Another might feel a deep sense of powerlessness about it and still a third might say "There's something wrong with me, I should have taken driving lessons." Each False Core Driver-False Self Compensator interprets the same trauma through a different lens. If you take off the lens (i.e., dismantle the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator) then you experience ESSENCE and/or the I AM. This is why ESSENCE, the I AM THE NOT-I I etc. go unnoticed or are not stabilized in our awareness. Most of our attention is unknowingly focused on the False Core Driver while at the same time we try to compensate for it in some way by creating a False Self Compensator. Any attempt to reform it, transform it, reframe it, re-associate it, take the good (healthy) stuff and leave the 28 25 ________________ Chapter bad (unhealthy), turn our vices into virtues, etc.â€”are all strategies of the False Self Compensator which tries to overcome, resist and resolve the False Core Driver.
