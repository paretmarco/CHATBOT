Because of the awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE, there is a natural walking around, daily awareness a free no state-state, which means that there is No-I. Actually there is no meditation because there is No-I meditating. There is no longer any internal considering, no voices or internal dialogue and no more interruptions in emotions, i.e., the outward motion. That is core yoga. It is Taoist yoga. It is Buddhist yoga and with it, the you you call yourself ends. There Chapter VIII are no more trances or, better said, TRANCE-ENDING occurs naturally, In other words, when you are ready to meditate, meditation is not necessary. Unfortunately, sometimes people practice yoga from outside of themselves so that their bodies can look a certain way, appear a certain way, or act a certain way. This is not core yoga. Core yoga is about moving from the BIOLOGICAL CORE which is from inside out. If you have Yoga teachers who are trying to get you in particular positions or postures so that you "look" a certain way, you are doing yoga from your sleeve and the postures are dissociative postures.
