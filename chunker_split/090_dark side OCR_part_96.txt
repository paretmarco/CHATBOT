Before the dance started, I saw a woman enter and in a moment it was "Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger..." She asked David to introduce us, and this was the conversation. David:"This is my friend Narayan (my name given in India), he s from ... India." 58 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child Woman:"Oh, I just saw the film Ghandi. It was great." Stephen:"I didn't like it." (She looked confused, so to save the day I said,) "Well, for a long movie, it really moved fast." Woman:"Really? I thought it dragged." Stephen:"Well, I guess you and I aren't going to agree on anything." Woman:"I don't even agree with you on that." Needless to say, I saw the pattern of my inner child, interrupted it, and this relationship lasted 10 seconds rather than 10 months or 10 years. This is the power of attraction of the inner child. As an adult, you are attracted to certain people.
