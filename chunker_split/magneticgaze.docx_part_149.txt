[62] There were however some people who, due to translation-induced problems, believed that the image of a horse was truly present. [63] Cf. Seligmann, op. cit. [64] The Assyrian word to denote “evil eye” is “i-nu li-mut-tu”. Its literal translation means “the rotational movement of the eyes” (Cf. Lehmann, “Abergl”, 41, 1898 edition, as quoted by Seligmann on page 231). [65] This is Virgilio’s method. Eyes have in fact different powers. After all, the concept of different degrees of ocular opening is present in many traditions. According to Naphtali Katz, a scholar of the Talmud, an eye desiring to make an impact must necessarily be closed. If the eyes are both open, in fact, there is balance and man is an image of god, whereas closing one eye alters the balance. This might be the origin of the fear of one-eyed people, which is widespread among several peoples (Arabs or Bulgarians, though similar traditions are present in Veneto as well – Cf. Seligmann, op. cit., at p. 232).
