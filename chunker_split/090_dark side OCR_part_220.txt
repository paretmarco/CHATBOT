Notice how the trance of spiritualization organizes the chaos of being brought up in a dysfunctional family, giving it to a higher and more dissociated purpose. In the song, Do You Remember, John Lennon says, "Do you remember when you were small. How people seemed so tall?" This is the higher power phenomenon. The child has to look up to parents because children are physically smaller and less developed. Notice in most religions, you "look up" to God; this is the child's re-creation of being small, looking up at parents now called "God." This pre- supposes God has a location. * This ordering of chaos by the child is a powerful way he can avoid his personal pain and be grandiose about his own specialness. The illusion of the child within is that she is serving some higher person, so that the "higher person" will take care of her by giving her knowledge, love, etc. The child is physically smaller and sees adults as bigger, thus attributing higher knowledge, and in many cases magical power, which are spiritualized parents.
