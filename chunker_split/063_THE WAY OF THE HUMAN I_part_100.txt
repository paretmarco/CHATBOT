For example, imagine that an incest survivor comes to me for psychotherapy and, as a therapist, I help her work through her beliefs, emotions, and memories. What happens when she goes home and has sex with her partner? The minute her body is in the same or a similar position as when the molestation happened, all the material comes back up again. You need "hands-on" work in order to liberate awareness that is unknowingly fixated in the body for the trauma to be free of the body memories. So I always recommend body-work for this reason. Recent body-work (1996) with Alfred Schatz has also included research into the brain. For example, if you had a trauma, i.e., your father beat you, you can perhaps handle the psychological and emotional implications, but there will be a "body memory," the result being that if you hold your posture in a particular way that posture will reinforce the memory. In addition parts of your brain itself might not be "on line," thus sending "mixed messages" or not using other parts of the brain. Physical injuries too can get tied up in the psyche in the same way.
