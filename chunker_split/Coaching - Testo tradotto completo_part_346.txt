The two general rules that ought to govern the articulation of our formula are as follows: 1 The formula must be an affirmative one in the present tense. – We must not say, for example: «I will never be sad again», but rather something in the vein of «I am in a good mood». 2 The formula must be exceedingly short. We must in fact focus our thought on an asseveration, as a testimony of faith. The entire testimony of faith of Christian people is condensed in a single word: I BELIEVE. General Preparation and Method How to ready the environment a) Put yourselves in an environment which is equipped with a mirror. b) Once you have settled on your favourite formula 81, write it down on a piece of paper, in very large characters. Place the piece of paper vertically. The sheet of paper must remain in an upright position through the help of a book or some other form of support. The paper must be at the same level as your eyes, at a distance, moreover, which enables you to read it comfortably while your head leans against the back of your chair, better still your couch.
