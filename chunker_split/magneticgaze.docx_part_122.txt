In that manner, you shall attain the so-called appropriation of the gaze. Very soon, the look of the person who is susceptible of being captivated attaches itself to yours and no longer moves away from it. The subject then follows your look everywhere: By you stepping back, he moves forward, and by you stepping ahead, he moves back. If you bend lower, he lowers his position, just as he rises the moment you stand up. Some people will imitate the whole range of your gestures, and execute all the suggestions you would like to impose on them without them retaining any memory that it is you who issued those suggestions. By repeated attempts which you are going to make on the sane subject, the state of fascination will alight at him with growing intensity, and susceptibility to suggestions will be enhanced. In order to bring this state to an end, all you need to do is to blow into the eyes of the subject. By placing one hand in front of the eyes of a charmed person and by directing him onto another individual, the subject is going to attach himself ineluctably to the look of such third party.
