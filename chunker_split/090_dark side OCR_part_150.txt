This enables the person to take charge of the created image. 6. Voice Control. For auditory illusionings, like hearing parental voices, the following techniques are helpful. Imagine a stereo with three speeds, 78, 33-1/3, and 45. Imagine the voice as if it were on the record. Play the voices fast, then medium, then slow. Make the sound louder, softer, and then shift the speakers. This is a way of taking charge of the audio illusioning. 7. Trance-ference. If you notice you are projecting on men or women, imagine them as Mom or Dad. Intentionally create a mom and dad mask on all men and all women for a week. This will awaken the observer of the inner child, so the observer can take charge of the process. Conclusion Illusioning is a trance that can be appreciated for what it is the inner child' s defense. With this understanding, the adult can explore his inner child's defenses as "creative choices," and thus the observer can take charge of the automatic illusioning.
