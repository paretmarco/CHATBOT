Let me give a few, everyday examples. Anxiety is a fear of the future. A client whose presenting problem is anxiety goes into the trance of futurizing (see Chapter 5). The inner child imagines a catastrophic future and so hypnotizes the adult in present time into a fear trance. Of course, an adult hears the self- talk of the inner child' s dark side, "It will never work out" (Inner Dialogue, Chapter 7), followed by an inability to see other options (Chapter 8, Blocking-Out). The dark side of the inner child might suggest to the adult that these isn't enough time, creating even more anxiety. Maybe he even imagines a bill collector taking away his house (Illusioning, Chapter 9). The presenting problem, anxiety, is full of trances, as are all prob- lems. Most are re-creations of the dark side of the inner child. The inner child continues autonomously, with the adult experi- encing past situations as present situations. Another example is an alcoholic client who, as the session continued, began to age-regress (act younger, see Chapter 4).
