This infantile state is reinforced by philoso- phies like the guru system of Hinduism, or the Roman Catholic system of the Pope, i.e., the intermediary between people and God. This trance creates religious systems and volumes of books of study, which reinforce the truth of the system. Spiritualization Commandment: do unto a person, that which you did unto yourself with your parents, in order to survive. In other words, make people into gods. Trance-ferring onto a System In this infant/child-like trance of spiritualization, an infant/ child transfers the past idealization onto a spiritual system. In spiritual systems, the infant/child within the adult overlays her system on the world. This makes the world a "play of God," (a play of Mom/Dad), or a way to learn lessons (Mom' s/Dad' s lessons). This child within the system gives its power away to "a higher power." The tautology is that the' adult relates only to the child within, transferring its world onto the confused world of Mom and Dad and then making it spiritual. This offers the adult, currently being hypnotized by the infant/child, no feedback loop with the world.
