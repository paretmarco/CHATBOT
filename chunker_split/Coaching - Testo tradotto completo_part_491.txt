What we define by the use of such term is a series of negative beliefs which have been absorbed from the environment, and which prevent the trader from a gainful pursuit of his activity, due to the fact they generate a number of “confusions” concerning the targeted goal, whereupon the goal ultimately suffers the fate that it is no longer practically pursued. An essential pronouncement you should use as a departure point is to assert the fact that you create your own life, whereas one who is not an achiever will say: “Life just forces itself on me”. The causative agents of self-sabotaging consist in expressions and ways of thinking you have heard from your parents, such as “it is hard to succeed”. Another possibility is that they have passed onto you the thought to the effect that “you do not deserve”, etc. A textbook example one can refer to in this connection is provided by some Rock singers who thought about themselves that they “did not deserve”. When they began to taste success, they started a process of self-destruction caused by consumption of alcohol and drugs.
