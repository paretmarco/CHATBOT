If I am a soccer coach blessed with a side of technically formidable players in each position of the field, and I have at my disposal, in addition, alternatives who are equally gifted from a technical point of view, and yet I make the wrong tactical moves, my team risks losing the match even if, on paper, it is the stronger of the two sides. Assuming that, in the course of a particular game, when things appear to be turning against my side, I have an “intuition” and opt to substitute a certain player with specific technical characteristics with another one whose technical characteristics are different we might end up winning that match. It cannot be said that, in absolute terms, this substitute will make me win all the games. We can however assert that in that particular game he was the right player at the right time. What are the steps available to us if we want to implement some tactics which will turn us into winners? We can achieve that through intuition! Intuition emerges from our inward. It is through its medium that we can make pragmatic use of all our resources, so as to succeed in achieving whatever we wish.
