The identity dream, acting child-to- child without appropriate feedback interpersonally, might cause depression, anxiety, etc. "Externalization" occurs when an individual, during his devel- opment, is denied the particular experience of a safe, loving, supportive environment that would afford him a sense of whole- ness, completion and well-being. To counter or neutralize this deprivation, he creates a dream character who gives him the complete experience required for a greater sense of self. Children that develop imaginary playmates who provide them with appropri- ate levels of love, understanding, and affection demonstrate this phenomenon. Externalization is a process that provides a person with discon- nected experiences that are needed. To repeat the earlier example, while I lived in India, an introverted friend had a recurring identity dream of himself delivering a speech on the state of the World to the United Nations. After chatting with him for a while, I mentioned that nobody had listened to him as a child and he had been abused, hence, his inner child created this United Nations dream. Here, the family was transferred by the inner child onto the United Nations.
