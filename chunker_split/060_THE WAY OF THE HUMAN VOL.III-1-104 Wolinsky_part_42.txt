Is that judgment from your father? Barbara:It's coming from my father who is in the corner. Therapeutic Note A pure being as ESSENCE or I AM does not judge itself. Therefore, it had to have come from something "outside" of her. The only question is Who? Wolinsky:So have an image of your father over there and take the label off of it and have it as energy, and allow that judging energy to go back to its source, i.e., your father. A lot of grief is about that. Say that to me. A lot of my grief is putting my attention on her so something comes back about her to me so I can feel like I exist. ________________ Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: ________________ I can do that. How are you doing now? Just here. How does this feel? You had to give energy to your mother so that she would give energy to you so that you would exist. It's kind of fun in a way.
