I then illusioned being a coach. Soon I saw that I didn't have those skills and moved on to find where my skills were. This is a developmental process. If I had become obsessed with playing with Larry Bird and couldn't even give it up when I wasn't drafted, I might have experienced depression. In the woman-who-was-Christ example, I asked the client to imagine that the guides who came to see her and the voices she heard were actually coming from the child inside her. I asked, "How would you feel if this is true?" She said, "Whew, relieved." She comfortably saw the illusions were coming from inside of her. She felt relieved. No anxiety. The important idea to note is that trances are a continuum from solid to liquid. We all use trances. Her trance wasn't bad, just more solid than mine. In my case I let go of the desire to be a basketball hero, integrating interpersonal feedback. In contrast, her developmental illusions solidified because she cut off interpersonal feedback. I saw a film in the early 70s directed by Roman Polansky called Repulsion, which demonstrates illusioning.
