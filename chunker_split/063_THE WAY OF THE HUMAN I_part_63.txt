Let's say my father was an alcoholic and I try to do mantras, yantras, and/or tantras to try to transcend that. I can have a beautiful meditation and a beautiful experience of the VOID. I can open my eyes but within a short period of time I am back into the "uncooked seeds" of my psychology (see below). Soon I am arguing with my spouse, bickering with my father, etc. You will immediately grab onto your False Core-False Self and your uncooked seeds. Many people who are trying to transcend their psychology are in a spiritual denial. They use meditation as medication. They don't want to feel things. In this way transcendence is a trance and a resistance and hence does not work. UNCOOKED SEEDS The Indian metaphor I like to use is that of "uncooked seeds." Uncooked seeds are your unprocessed psychological material, i.e., your False Core and False Self. To illustrate, if I take some seeds, place them in the ground, and water them, they will grow and bear fruit. But if I take the same seeds, cook them in a frying pan and then place them in the ground, nothing will happen.
