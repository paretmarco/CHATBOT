The exercise of the book Take a book and begin to run through its lines with your sight, in such a way as to cover every alternate page in an opposite sense, as was the case with the ancient Greek script. In other words, once you have run through the first line normally (from left to right), you should proceed in the contrary direction with the next line, i.e. from right to left, and so on and so forth. While doing that, you ought to lower your look constantly. Repeat this exercise by covering an increasingly larger number of lines. N. B. What is of course required is not to understand what one is reading through. Exercise 16. The policemanâ€™s look This exercise, which is the consequential fruit of all the previous ones, is so called because it tends to bestow on policemen the special prerogative of watching objects from right to left, while making as if they are not actually seeing them. You must thus walk along the road while you keep your head down, as if a stiff neck precluded you from turning it in any direction.
