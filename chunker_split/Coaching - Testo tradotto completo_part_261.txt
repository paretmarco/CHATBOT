Secondary plans and subordinate plans We will thus get a first differentiation between the execution of the operations which we will need to carry out during a specific period of our existence, whence the imperative requirement of subdividing the general life plan into several secondary plans that are subordinated to it and in which alone — we ought to reiterate — they find their entire reason of being. As we have stated earlier, one can extrapolate from the whole plan a smaller portion which is limited to the execution of a particular program, one which is circumscribed, that is, to the specific necessities associated with a given stage of our life. That does not detract from the enduring benefit and logic of an annual subdivision of the general plan, which retains therefore an essential role. Moreover, as the year comprises its own natural subdivisions, the subdivisions into months, weeks and days, we are going to break down the yearly plan, in turn, to monthly, weekly and daily plans. As they narrow down, these plans are going to correspondingly find their concrete actualization, thereby becoming progressively more subdivided into actions which are related to the needs of the moment.
