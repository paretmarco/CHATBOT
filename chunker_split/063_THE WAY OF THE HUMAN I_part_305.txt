Desire can occur at any point in a child's development. For example, notice that with an infant or a young child, most of their wanting is to relieve biological pain such as hunger or cold. Or it is the need to fill a lack, like wanting a hug or wanting to feel safe. Later in life, the child uses what is called transitional objects like blankets, teddies, pillows, which they carry around as "substitute friends" so they don't have to feel separate. Another perspective equates desire with resistance and says that if I desire X it's because I'm resisting V. For example, if I desire to have money, it's because I am simultaneously resisting my subjective experience, (be it real or unreal of no money). In this way, desiring and resisting are two sides of the same coin. Unmet biological desires are painful (see Volume II on the False Core). When pain is resisted it is often substituted, replacing psychological wants (i.e., for food, sex, etc). Since many wants exist to relieve biological and/or emotional pain, problems arise when we try to substitute one pain reliever for another.
