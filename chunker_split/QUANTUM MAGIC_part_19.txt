867 When two observers see the same thing, they both may have certain experiences in common, they both may affect the thing observed, and they may report some of the events the same and some differently. Experience may be categorized in a multiple universe mode and/or in a single universe mode. If would be interesting to know which mode is most useful for various purposes. It is obvious that some people have such a different personal perception of reality as to be seemingly out of touch with the world we experience around them. Their self-world image becomes more important than anything, and they adjust their memories and perceptions to meet whatever emotional needs they have at the time [9]. Delusions of personal reality and the high probability that such realities are real for the person experiencing that reality can result in interesting questions about what is real and what is unreal. Although the universe may be a seamless whole, most physicists describe it in two different modes, depending on whether things are being observed or not [7]: o A classical, mechanistic mode for the definite attributes of observation, and o A statistical, mathematical, quantum mechanical mode for the wave patterns described by quantum mechanics.
