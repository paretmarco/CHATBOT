In addition to learning how to use instant ‘fixation’ they also learned how and where Virgilio had got his knowledge from. When he was fourteen years old Virgilio he had met ‘Rolando’. Rolando knew a very strange system of hypnotism.

Donato developed the system after having spoken with a former magnetist, the chanoine De Mouls. De Mouls used the normal, accepted method of mesmerising his subjects; stroking, or hand-movements down the body which took some twenty minutes. Donato was encouraged by De Mouls to diffuse magnetism and Then for some totally unknown reason he developed and started to use his own method of instant mesmerism which he subsequently called ‘Fascination Magnetism’ (‘Fascination Magnétique’): All he had to do was to fix his gaze upon a person and they responded to what he silently willed them to do.
