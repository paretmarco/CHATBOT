What is meant by this is that the observer freezes the inner-child identity and relates to the present- time world through this window. Interestingly enough, that "fear" (feels frozen and cold, a major complaint of many clients. In other words the observer freezes the memory by using fear. Fear, there- fore, becomes the vehicle used by the observer to freeze the natural flow of a memory. The inner child relates child-to-adult in past time, rather than self-to-other in present time. For example, I was working with a 30 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child divorced woman, who said that her husband was constantly imag- ining she was a bitch. No matter what she did to prove otherwise, he continued to claim this was so. One day over lunch, she looked into his eyes and noticed a film covering his eyes. He had moved from a present-time interaction (self-to-wife) to an inner child trance (child-to-Mom) and he was watching some past picture of mom, that he overlaid on his wife in present time. This process, moving into the inner child, explains why we often feel alone in relationships.
