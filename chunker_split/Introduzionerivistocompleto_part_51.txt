The Time Line allows us to set fire to the way we envision that life should be led, obtain awareness of it, and intervene in such a way to improve how we live our past memories and to “build our bricks in the best way to construct how we want our future to be”. I bet everyone has heard someone using the expressions, “I’ve put my past behind me” or “I see a successful future ahead of me”. It is nothing other than giving space to something that does not exist anywhere else than in your head. “Time is perception, it is memory!” “Time is contained in the present and inside it there is everything you can hope for, complete and understand. Wherever you are, that place holds all places and whatever distance you travel, embrace all distances”. (Gibran) One of the characteristics of Time Line is that it is not necessary to repeat it and it only works if the subject really wants to leave a negative state of mind. The first thing that the operator needs to do is to elicit the time line, in other words make it visible. Individualize, in the space surrounding him, the arrangement of images relative to various times of his/ her life until a line is created that connects past, present and future events. These should make him/ her realise that when s/he thinks of his/ her future or his/ her past, s/he is able to arrange them in the space around him/ her, defining direction and distance.
