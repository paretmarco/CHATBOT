Overcoming the encumbrance of one’s own ego Greatness makes the body heavy (Tao Te King) What is especially important to avoid is excessive self-esteem and the exaggerated inner dialogue every one of us engages with his own self. We are, period. We are not all these internal dialogues of ours. Even the word “self” is an inappropriate one for defining our reality, which is indeed far vaster than this word. Focusing excessive attention on one’s own limited “ego” is what consumes mental energy the most. Hyper-attention which is directed at our own selves prevents us from seeing the world. Many people strut in this world with a superb demeanour and with pride, as if they deemed themselves phenomenal creatures. The egocentric idea becomes excessively infixed in many of us whenever we turn ourselves into the centre of the world, the focus of every glance, the goal of every attention. It is an utterly ridiculous concept, given that every man thinks the same of his own self. We must accordingly remind ourselves properly that we are like a drop of water, a grain of sand, a spark in a conflagration.
