A person can meditate and have an experience but you still have to be able to contain the biological level and be willing to have it. The biology is your grounding wire, the point where ESSENCE and I AM meet the world. THE BIOLOGICAL FALSE CORES The biological False Cores are different from and yet similar to the psycho-emotional False Cores (see Volume II). The psycho-emotional False Cores are conclusions drawn from the realization of separation and can be processed by tracing back and staying in the False Core, removing the later traumas which re-enforced it and, ultimately, dismantling this False Core conclusion. The biological False Cores are also part of the nervous system yet they somehow seem more basic. They are interpretations of the nervous system which have been passed down through evolution and hard-wired into it. This means they are earlier, biologically rooted, pre-verbal, and difficult to process." " It should be noted that Alfred Schatz, is doing research into processing these neurological Nervous System hard-wires. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness What you can do however is: Unfuse the later chains of associations which trigger the biology. 2.Acknowledge with awareness the difference in dimensions.
