Paying less heed to our egos, and doing so on an ongoing basis, allows us in fact to be more open and benevolent towards other people. Through that, we might finally be able to listen to what they are saying, understanding what they are feeling (without of course letting ourselves becoming involved), realizing the value of every person and thereby improving our social relationships.
