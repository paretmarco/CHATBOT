________________ DEMONSTRATION #5 Alice:When I do this, I can feel a flow of ESSENCE but I hold onto the False Core, too. Wolinsky:Get a sense of the flow for right now. Notice the BIG EMPTY SPACE. And notice all the chains that get associated with that in your life. Notice the size and shape of the empty space and all of its chains. Ask the EMPTY SPACE which is fused with aloneness, "What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?" Alice:It says love. Therapeutic Note Here we are trying to get as NON-VERBAL as possible by moving beyond her concept of love since love was fused with alone. Alice:It's like this wavy feeling. It's like I'm just trying to show what it feels like. Wolinsky:How does the False Core seem to you from inside that wavy? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Alice:Pretty insignificant.
