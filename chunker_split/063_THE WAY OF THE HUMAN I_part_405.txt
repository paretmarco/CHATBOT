Like all patterns in the mind which creates divisions and separations, this escalates and Pasaphae, the feminine archetype believes, in the separation which is proposed by the mind (Poseidon). She loses herself in her overwhelming desire because she sees sexuality as something separate from herself. Phasaphae has the architect, Daedalus (an image builder) make her a Bull container that she can fit into so as to attract the Bull. This symbolizes how this works in our society. We do not understand the natural sexual impulse and so we divide and separate it from ourselves. Because of this separation, we create an image rather than allowing the pure natural biological attraction that people could have for sexuality. An image (container) is used to entice or seduce men (or women) and vice-versa. She must hide herself (her real feelings) and who she is, in or behind a container or mask in order for the (Bull) to want to have sex with her. Here we see the lies. First, the separation from the unified whole mind. Next the separation of the body and the mind. Next the separation of sex from ourselves.
