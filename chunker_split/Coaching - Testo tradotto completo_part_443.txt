The simplest system to peel off any emotional vestige from a fact, to remove from it any slag left in it by your emotional side, is to immediately halt the process of piling up the rationalizing justifications causing the perpetuation of our anxiety, by simply deflecting your mind away from such rationalizations, while at the same time you execute the deep breathing exercise. Being present also means to decide with oneâ€™s own head. As we are the ones who create our own life, we alone can then lay down our true goals for earning. The most important thing, however, is to slay the impulsive self. How come we keep on repeating the same errors, whereby we buy at a time when we should be selling or we sell at the time where we should be buying, unable throughout that to exercise control over our own impulses? Some people ascribe the repeated mistakes of traders who buy at the top of the ascending curve and who sell when the market price is at its lowest, to what is called "foolish human nature". That might be so.
