If that was not enough he turned his gaze on another customer, and without saying a word the customer’s face became ashen and virtually diaphanous as if it was made of wax. Then Virgilio asked him what he name was. The customer replied giving a woman’s name, much to the amusement of the other customers, but it was the name Virgilio had silently willed the customer to give. After that Virgilio returned him to his normal self. Max was entranced by Virgilio’s demonstration and soon afterwards, and with Virgilio’s permission, took a number of friends to see him demonstrating his amazing, silent and rapid hypnotic demonstrations. On the other hand his friend Marco Paret remained a level-headed businessman and was initially unimpressed. Despite his negativity Max continued to regale him with what Virgilio was able to do, and constantly asked Marco to come with him and see for himself what amazing powers Virgilio possessed. Under that continued pressure Marco was finally persuaded to go and see for himself all the things Max had described ands he had thought bordered upon the impossible. And not only did he see them but Virgilio successfully used his fixed gaze technique on him, but his personal experience was to change Marco Paret’s life. After his personal experience he had long conversations with Max about how Virglio’s fixed method could be used to restore people to good health. They both agreed they had found something which would of great benefit to humanity and decided before they did else they would approach Virgilio Torrizzano and ask him he would accept them as his students.
