He acts according to fixed laws. This man who has achieved popularity, influence, wealth or success, he simply accepted these gifts, considering them as if they were due, as the logical result of putting into action the laws of cause and effect. 9. He is likeable. Which impression gave you this man? This: you want to know him better because you feel that he is nice, in a mysterious way you cannot define. He keeps you in his domain, and you cannot avoid his influence even after leaving him. 10. He is using your strength. If now you want remember well the conversation you had with him, you will see — although then you did not notice — that you were the one showing your knowledge, you have been the one who tried to please: in a word, you were the one who gave. You gave he received. If he would have wanted it to be otherwise, strong of his consciousness value, he would have forced you to receive from him whatever he would have liked to give you, in terms of impulses, orders, ideas. If he wanted to, he could have made you bend as wind bends the reeds of a pond. Why is that? Because this is the Law, and he knows it, but you ignore it. Anyway, he did not want to, he simply granted himself to make a good impression, and then he left after having taken a bit of your magnetism, as the bee flies away after taking honey from a flower.
