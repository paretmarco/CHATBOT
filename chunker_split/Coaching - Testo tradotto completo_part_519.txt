The point of the matter is that the more we have the chance of gathering a variety of data and points of view (which would essentially mean we have managed to build a well-developed quantum register, one going even further than the three points we have referred to earlier), the greater will be our predisposition to snatch those intuitions enabling us to attain our goal. This is indeed an essential element behind the potential success of self-hypnosis. Through hypnosis, in fact, we might notify our mind of what we would like to attain, without however informing it of the method through which we shall accomplish that. This latter ability will be provided to us by our unconscious mind. This is this type of intuitions that will allow us to obtain the best results, as it denotes moving beyond our rational thinking and efficiently resorting to the power of our unconscious mind. When a trader fails in his intent, he tends to look up to other people for the solution to his problems, and scouts around for pre-packed trading methods and systems which are deemed infallible, and which are often advertised on the Internet as guaranteeing inflated percentages of return on oneâ€™s investment.
