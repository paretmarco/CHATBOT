We are stuck with a window through which we are seeing the world, or better yet, not seeing the present-time world. The dark side of the wounded child 1-dentity becomes our nemesis, when it 20 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child shrinks the observers' present-time world, making it look like a past-time experience. In other words, the observer goes to sleep, and unknowingly looks through the inner child world view. Trance can be defined as wakeful sleep. In the beginning trance occurs through a series of interactions with other people like Mom, Dad, a teacher, and even a boss, friends, husbands, wives, children, etc. The trance you designed had a purpose to maintain, protect, or support you as a child. The trance became an automatic response to other people, and developed an autonomy of its own. Stated another way, a child relates to the family in a particular way. This is the trance the child uses in that family.
