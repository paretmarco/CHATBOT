And soon you begin to see that it is only a concept, and it is not true. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The paradox of this approach is that we must work with it, without the intention of getting rid of it. You work with it to see what occurs. The question often is, "Doesn't there have to be an intention in order to do it in the first place?" No. If the processes are done from a No-State State of I AM, there is no intention. Then, study it and dismantle it until it can begin to fall away. You might see it, observe it, the connections tracing back every thought, feeling and fantasy to see how your whole life has been organized around this one thing, and then dismantling it through enquiry. Ultimately, the enquiry continues until "you" realize that you are neither the enquirer-questioner nor the answerer. But this understanding occurs much "later" when you begin to see how everything is organized around one structure. It is then that you can go beyond the obsessive-compulsive fixated structure which is the False Core, thus liberating your awareness and discovering WHO YOU ARE.
