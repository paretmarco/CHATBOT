The inner child can illusion and project it on a situation or person, and subjectively make it feel as though it is true. Each inner child determined his experience of my energy through his own needs. This is a form of illusioning, feeling what is not there, seeing and defining things as we need them to be seen and defined. My first teacher was the noted industrial psychologist Dr. Frederick Herzberg. Herzberg would sum it up this way, "We define things the way we need them to be defined." Remedy of illusioning: Check it out with the other person. A reality check to see where the other person is coming from helps to determine if you are illusioning. This requires, however, a willing- ness to take responsibility for your trance-ferred feelings. It also requires you to look at yourself, rather than at another, as the creator of your experience. A goal in therapy is to understand that the child within is illusioning. Look at it developmentally. In the case where the woman was to become Christ, the illusion of the child within began as the adult described her illusions. She began to look young, three or four years old.
