For example, a woman who saw me for therapy found that when she acted stupid in her family, Dad (a man) would take care of her. Her inner child had a dark side that had a "stupid" trance, which became a problem as an adult when the men she attracted treated her as though she were stupid. This process confused her. Though she was a powerful businesswoman, she was attracted to men who treated her as stupid. What really occurred? The time-frozen little girl within her was choosing men, and was attracted to men, who were like Dad while the observer slept. This attraction was actually the attraction that the dark side of the inner child had. Outside of her awareness, the inner child' s dark side was choosing men like Dad, which, in present time, had nothing to do with men she would be interested in. Sometimes she would find herself going into a "stupid" trance and kick herself later for acting that way. This became the target of de-hypnosis in her therapy. Allowing the observer to de-hypnotize, observe, and awaken from a deep sleep, she saw a child identity that she had created in the past.
