To joke about this New Age grandiosity, noted New Age comedian Swami Beyondananda said, "Everyone now is so New Age, even muggers are New Age. I was walking down the street the other day. A mugger knocked me down, grabbed my wallet, and as he was running away said, 'Now, why did you create this in your life'?" THE NEW AGE COMPLEX Viewing through the lens of developmental psychology, I call this trance the "New Age Complex," because in this trance, to use the words of psychoanalytic developmental psychology, the child imagines "The world is your oyster." Here the child falls in love with their own grandiosity as they learn to walk and talk. They feel like they can create it all, do it all, accomplish anything. This does not appreciate the context in which we live. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The context is greater than the individual. Special Section THE DISCIPLE TRANCE The disciple (who is stuck in this infantile trance) plays out the other side of this identity, imagining the teacher or guru (mother/ father) is omniscient and can see, feel, or know the disciple's innermost heart.
