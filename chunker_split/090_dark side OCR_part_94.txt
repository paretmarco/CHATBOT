The child takes on his parents' pain with the hope of healing them. This occurs when the child now believes they can heal others or make others feel better Dis-connection â€¢ 57 because of their imagined power. This infantile grandiosity leaves the child imagining power to help another, when they actually feel powerless as children. Years later, they develop a healer trance, imagining they can be responsible for taking away another's pain. For example, I once knew a man who claimed to be this kind of healer. Clients paid him to heal them and, amazingly, he, at times, got results. The problem was that the client's pain almost always came back. Why? Because, if a person is feeling pain, they must take responsibility for their subjective reality. When I spoke to the healer, he said that as a child he would imagine that being with his dysfunctional father helped his father feel better. In fact, his father would often times lighten-up around his son. Later in life the child within imagined magical powers as a way to resist the powerless- ness of his childhood. Hence, the age-regressed child within hypnotized the adult into becoming a healer.
