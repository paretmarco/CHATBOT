Stated more simply, you will feel lonely if you are operating out of an inner-child identity trance, because you are not in present time seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing and being. The inner child cuts off present-time contact and feels the loneliness of no contact in past time.

When she makes love with a man, she opens her eyes and blocks the man out. She does not see this man, who states, "I want to be your friend and an occasional lover." He is being very clear about what he wants. She is blocking-out his communi- cation visually and auditorially. She fantasizes, "No, he can't be saying that, he really means ...." Notice how blocking-out and fantasizing work so well in tandem.
