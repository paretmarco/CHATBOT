If the context in question is the conclusion of a business deal, what one of us would attempt to do is to shape himself up, in his inner envisioning, as if, in that moment, he actually was the friend of his regaled with the shrewdest commercial mind. In the event of a sentimental situation where he runs the risk of appearing clumsy, he would imagine himself to be his most adroit acquaintance, the most skilled one in the field of sentimental liaisons. As for the scenario where eloquence must be resorted to, he would conceive himself as being a great orator; and if he is called upon to put up a show of some energetically strong or violent person, he would envision himself to be his briskest companion. How would any of such substitutes act? Let us properly put up a warning that we are not dealing here with any issue of taking as oneâ€™s model either this or that acquaintance of ours. The issue is to successfully cause our own inward being to learn. It is a bit like shedding off the garment of our own personality by going to the length of replacing it with the new personality.
