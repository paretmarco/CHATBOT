Exercise 44 – Dreaming up the means - method 1 Look at a light – Close your eyes and “dream up” your aim. See it inside the light, or behind it, in any event within a setting in which this light is present (It might even consist in a lamp). Proceed as if you were retracing your steps, immersed at this stage in your imagination, and letting yourself feel somewhat certain of arriving at destination. Open your eyes, and enjoy the feeling of satisfaction by linking it to your body (in a state of self-awareness thereof). This exercise is also good if one wants to conquer his worries. Exercise 45 – Dreaming up the means - method 2 This exercise is quite similar to the previous one, the only difference being the fact that, instead of releasing a slight conviction that we are going to reach the goal, we are going to repeat the act of observing the light a number of times (ranging from two to three), and each time we are going to record in writing whatever idea might occur to our mind. We will notice that a logical sequence of phases will manifest to us.
