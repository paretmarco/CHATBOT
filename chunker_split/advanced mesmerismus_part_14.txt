Every day for a quarter of an hour, repeat some suggestions aloud and perform exercises number 2 and 3 of the second series to the letter. You will acquire formidable power and become "masters" by laying the foundations for wonderful hypnotic success. The word of the hypnotist, when he speaks with conviction and confidence and especially when he thinks intensely that the subject must obey, is a force. I realized this when I was influenced by my teacher. As he spoke every word increased the effect of the influence, until it became irresistible. I have often realized the power of verbal suggestions by experimenting with thousands of subjects. You don't need to memorize the suggestions; you can change the terms without compromising your success. The important thing is to put yourself within the reach of the subject's intelligence. You cannot use the same vocabulary with a university teacher and a semi-illiterate pastor. Experience then taught me that it is not so much the way of imparting suggestions, finding appropriate terms and speaking slowly and with conviction, as a kind of personal magnetism derived from practice, from the tension of the will, from self-confidence and from security of the required phenomenon which contributes greatly to success. The difference in the results obtained by two different hypnotists on the same subject comes from the personal magnetism they have been able to develop. The strength of the gaze trained to stare for a long time. period, avoiding blinking, and training to give continuous suggestions, will allow you to quickly put your hypnotic power to the test. The results will come.
