We should not forget that, after all, while there are several things one cannot do, there is nothing which one is disabled from «not doing». This warning applies to all those people who, in order to justify themselves, refer to an irresistible impulse, only for them to later regret the fact they have acted recklessly. We come back in this regard to our main thesis, that is, the necessity of smashing automatism, by judging whether satisfaction has not been already experienced, and if experiencing it again in the same forms is truly worth the effort. We must ask ourselves: What kind of satisfaction I am seeking? Have I already tasted it in the past? Would it not be possible for me to rather discover something new? The instantaneous or periodical erasure of the superfluous aspects of our activity is a necessity, just as the daily or periodical disposal of material waste is a primary need of home economics.
