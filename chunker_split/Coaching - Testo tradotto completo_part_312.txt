If, owing to general presentification, our plan has in a sense become alive inside us, and one overwhelmingly determined to be actualized outwardly, the substitution of personality puts the conscious side to rest, thereby entrusting to the unconscious the task of acting on our behalf. Essentially, — as one can see —, in addition to the general presentification, we ought to work on a series of lightning-fast pre-visualizations, which are parallel and antecedent to the actions we are required to carry out. This presentification witnesses the simultaneous entry in it of the image of the action which the self is called upon to undertake, and, lastly, the image of our self as modified by the action once it has been implemented. This complex act of presentification which antedates the action is what we call Instantaneous Mono-ideation. It ensues from it that the day of an active person might be reduced to a series of extremely quick mono-ideations, which are linked to one another by the plan for the day.
