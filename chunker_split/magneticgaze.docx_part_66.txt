The process is termed by some people “curing through the symptom”. Through the patient’s total concentration on his symptom, in fact, we can carve out a path allowing us to talk with that part of the brain which generates such symptom. We thereby give effect to a mechanism which some healers have already resorted to, namely, "utilizing the crisis as a cure". [38] What at that point helps the efficacy and, in particular, the rapidity of the process, is the re-enactment of the problem itself. As stated by Rossi (1986), "by asking the patient to experience the symptom (alternatively, even by increasing it, as was for instance Erickson’s wont), we are probably switching on certain processes in the right hemisphere which are gifted with a more immediate access to the encoding of the problem that is related to the state itself ".
