Managing energy in the course of the day In order to reach our daily objectives, a further essential requirement is to accurately manage our energy. The plan will have to take that factor into consideration. It is imperative, for the sake of attaining the highest degree of efficiency, that the different actions we are called upon to carry out should in fact be programmed in such a way as to bear in mind the energy that is factually available to us, as the level of that energy is never the same, nor is it of an invariably similar kind. Energy in cyclical form Many people work indefatigably, until they feel tired and cannot go on any more. This is, however, nothing other than an improper use of forces, one which, moreover, occasions a significant waste of time, given that, when we are worn out, our productivity becomes progressively lower. Too often we spend energy in a linear way, that is, without subsequent recoveries, until we reach breaking point. It is instead necessary to espouse a CYCLICAL system of managing energy.
