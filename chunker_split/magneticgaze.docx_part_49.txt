Lift your eyes to your right to the greatest possible extent, and then let them trace a full circle. As you engage in this motion, the palms of your hands, similarly to the preceding exercise, must press firmly against your temples. Exercise 27. The look on the road We are going now to teach a rule aimed at impressing whoever happens to approach you on the road. If you want to make him take notice of the power of your look, you cannot begin by fixing your gaze on him from afar. You should rather figure out the most appropriate point at which you will start fixing the look of your eyes on his person. This point coincides with the moment in which your pupils are bound, in order to meet his pupils, to cover the largest space in their motion. This is something which confers on the eye a special and unforgettable glow. Accordingly, if the relevant individual were to stand right in front of us, we would only lift up our eyes to his person, in a flash, precisely when he is close to us.
