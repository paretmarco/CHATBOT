If there is an emotional problem, handle it at the emotional dimension. What Quantum Psychology has noticed is that when images are dismantled the BIOLOGICAL CORE, like ESSENCE becomes more available. Why? Because the interference patterns, or habitually fixated awareness, is unfixated and free. This allows body awareness and its re-education to be greatly enhanced and speeded-up. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The realization of this spinal connection up and through the spine to the cerebral cortex and beyond ignites the realization of biological spirituality (i.e., the grounded experience that the body too is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE). INTEGRATING THE OLDER WITH THE NEWER BRAIN To integrate this awareness: Step I: Notice a thought you are having. Step II: Follow or trace it down to the non-verbal sensation level in the lower brain (spine). Step III: Take a deep breath and take it down into the lower spine (lower brain); the no-state silent level. Step IV: Notice what happens. PSYCHOLOGY'S CREATION Ida Rolf saw the core as bipolar, with poles at the lower and upper cores, and that breakages in the balance create "psychology."
