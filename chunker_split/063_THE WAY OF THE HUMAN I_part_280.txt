Wolinsky:(To group) So we are going to look at it in terms of an energetic process as well as a psychological process. (To client) So this no control thing, I want to call it almost like a roaring, energyâ€”it's an energy moving underneath. Denise:Something coming at me or coming up in me, ris- ing. Yes, I know that one. Wolinsky:Where do you feel that? Denise:I would have to back up before my tightening. I feel it in my thighs. I feel it in my legs. Wolinsky:Take a look and see how far up. Denise:There's two levels. First, there is like a front first. It's in the inner thighs like a wash of energy coming up and then afterwards it's like there is a following, something on the backside of the calves. Like a little gentle, pulling, tugging thing. 172 Wolinsky:What did you create in response to his manic re- sponse to you? Denise:I clamped down' and got cooler instantly. I could feel the energy in me but what I do with it was, phew.
