If we unflinchingly keep on striking the same chords, the string can never stop vibrating 44. Essentially speaking, what must be done is to negate the emotional influence which tends to reproduce itself, or, expressed it in different words, to passively let it flow out. Due to the well known correlation between the physical and the psychological levels, the problem is solved by plunging oneself in a state of physical stillness, by for instance keeping silent, secluding oneself, or refraining from moving. There is, secondly, a violent procedure, which consists in stopping the vibration at once by striking the string with some external object. At a psychological level, what we would get is a reversibility of the relevant emotion. In other terms, the emotion might be halted abruptly, thereby producing in us a nervous «shock» of a different kind. Once more, on account of the selfsame principle of physical-psychological correlation, we might be able to induce in us a violent physical emotion: Jumping, racing, pinching or slapping ourselves, taking a shower, a scratching gesture or whatever.
