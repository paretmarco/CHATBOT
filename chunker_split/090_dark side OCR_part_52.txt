I recently saw a client who got sore throats whenever he felt anger. As we began to focus on his throat, an image of Dad emerged. When I asked him to express his anger at Dad, he could barely talk. I asked him, "What would you like to say to Dad?" He replied, "I'd like to strangle him." When I asked him to reach out and do it (in his mind), his throat contracted, and he had an urge to strangle himself. Here we see someone unable to express the outward motion toward Dad and, instead, turning it against himself and "strangling" himself. The result: chronic sore throats. In life when a problem appears, it often has a "feeling younger" quality to it that repeats itself not only at an emotional and physical level but also at a cognitive level. It can be presupposed that any problem contains an element of age regression (acting younger than you are), which is the signal that the inner child has taken over. As in all trances and identities, the age-regressed inner child effects the adult in present time.
