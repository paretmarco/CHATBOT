5 - Fascination relies on sensibility. Find a friend and try to exercise what is called "thought transmission". Begin with modern exercises (there is plenty of books on the subject) but after go back to the ancient. 6 - Exercise with all your clients, and even in everyday situation, for discovering the effects of the various type of gaze. 7 - While you gaze and exercise on others, remember always that for fascination the quantum axiom is fundamental: "the observer influences the observed". So firstly work on yourself and your expectations before working with others! Practice and do not hesitate to write me at paret@neurolinguistic.com for further ideas and hints.
