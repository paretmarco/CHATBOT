Can you say to me, I have to give up the idea that I'll ever be able to merge again. The hardest part is really giving up that I can never merge with my mother again. Good, say that again. The hardest part is accepting and giving up the fact that I can never merge with her again in all the ways we merged. Say that again. The hardest part is not ever having that merger with my mother in the way I had grown accustomed to. The way I could feel connected to her. I can't ever merge with her again that way. ________________ Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: ________________ Now, the question I have is, the kind of merger that you had with your mother, was it truly ever really satisfying? Or was there always a sense of something missing? Something was always missing and when I saw her at Thanksgiving, the essential connection was there and if I'm honest, that's not gone. Can you say to me, I have an Essential Connection if I'm honest with myself and it's not gone?
