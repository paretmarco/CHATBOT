NLP 3 means Neurolinguistic Programming 3. NLP 3 focuses our attention to a different logical level; it represents a development and a widening of the models that originally constituted NLP 1. Whats a logical level? A logical level is a level of analysis of reality. For example, the term “Forest” is at a different logical level from the term “Trees”; I could walk in a forest, and tell “I see only trees, I don’t see the forest.” Why? Because, in order to see the forest I must be at a different logical level. In the same manner, to a lower logical level a computer is nothing more than a mixture of plastics and metal elements, while at a higher level it becomes all that we think when we say “computer.” NLP 1 allowed to decipher the alphabet of communication; NLP 3 aids us in joining its letters in correct word-groupings —ie: techniques like anchoring or strategies are inserted in the dynamic communication-context of everyday life. Using NLP 3 means using the rights tools for Sales, Relationships, Therapy and for personal development. Some history The original title of the book “Neurolinguistic Programming” was “Neurolinguistic Programming I” the “1” meant that subsequent developments of the NLP were to come.
