What pleasure do I derive in carrying out such actions? If I were to give my life a mark from one to ten, do I think I am enjoying life to its fullest? Let us recapitulate: The element of «time» is the first individual capital asset, inasmuch as it is the space within which we act. The good news is that it is extremely easy to attain control over the element of time, due to the fact that such element is a construct, and as such it exclusively depends on our own attitude and on the extent to which we shall be “present to our own selves”. The people who in their lives enact such self-presencing are endowed with all the different types of freedoms. At that point, your life, your being, your financial situation, the state of your interpersonal relationships, all of that is able to develop a higher speed.
