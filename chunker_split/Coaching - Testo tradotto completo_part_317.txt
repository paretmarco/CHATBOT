His talk is exact, one of cutting precision, and at the same time shorn of futile stylistic embellishments. He knows how to listen to other people, and takes his time in order to understand what they are saying. He refrains from criticising any person, choosing to rather focus on doing. Whenever he is solicited to do so, he expresses his own opinion in a frank and straightforward manner, while taking good care to avoid imposing it whenever there is no need to do so. He is in the action. He works and is able to maintain himself at the material level he prefers. When he is at work, he truly works; when he is eats, he really busy himself with eating; when he amuses himself, he does so wholeheartedly; and when he sleeps, he is really asleep. He acts naturally. He does nothing in vain, and always confers a precise, clear and immediate purpose on his own activity. In order to “act naturally”, it would be beneficial to break down our activity into a number of parts.
