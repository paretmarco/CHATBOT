It is imperative, however, that we should not only live within temporal imagination. Whoever, in fact, does not also develop the time of the instant (Kairòs), only enslaves himself to his logical and habit-loving brain, and accordingly loses opportunities and the taste for life. He is incapable of manifesting vital energy, free from any time constriction, in the now. Whereas Chronos steers the vital energy, in fact, Kairòs frees it in a spontaneous manner, as it consists in the consciousness of the instant which sets energy free. Not being immersed in kairòs, therefore, means that one lacks the capacity to open himself up to higher horizons, including the spiritual and creative horizons. It is only in establishing a balance between these two times that success is found. 1) Chronos: Vital force directed at an objective – structure of the day 2) Kairòs: Vital force which is present in the now ? - distilled quintessence of the day Let us retain an attitude of life which is steeped in presence and the enjoyment of the now and of acting Short-Term Plan (day or week) ? Medium-term plan (year or time period directed at a goal) ?
