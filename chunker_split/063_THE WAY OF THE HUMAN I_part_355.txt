Later on we will discuss how children create a hereafter or spiritualized trance-ference metaphor when their biological needs are not met. ________________ Special Section ence between being a TEACHER and simply presenting material and teaching another what you know. I remember, while being trained in Ericksonian Hypnosis, one trainer saw himself as my TEACHER. I explained to him that he was not my TEACHER, but rather that he was teaching me hypnosis. He did not understand the difference. In order to differentiate, if I teach you how to play guitar, I am your guitar teacher. But if I see myself as a MASTER and your TEACHER, then I could be in countertrance-ference/trance-ference with you. Unfortunately for everyone involved, all too often the teacher is fused with the TEACHER. In Quantum Psychology, a true teacher has neither a subjective experience of being a TEACHER, nor do they really want to be one. It is just what is happening. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, the best a true teacher can,,clo is to give you the tools to work on yourself. This is empowering another.
