If we cross a road we had never walked on before, we will feel that road to be longer the first time around as compared to the return trip. The reason for it is that, on our way back, the road is already more familiar, whereupon we are less alert and less in search of new information; it likewise ensues from the said truth that when we live in automatic responses, time is as if swallowed, and years fly by in a matter of seconds. If we desire to experience development, it is accordingly imperative that we should be able to exit the limiting boundaries. Once we come to understand our true nature, we are also going to realize that there are gifts, thoughts, ideas which are deeply ours and which truly have their source in our innermost being. We are indeed a unique combination of elements, and we must become conscious of that fact. Originality, this primary norm which antedates any possible progress, is a cornerstone urging to be developed, away from any restricting framework, as an unshakeable purpose which the genuine adept of this method ought to cling to. Originality represents the exteriorization of the true power of the mind.
