They imagine that they are the center of the universe and that their beliefs or thoughts create their external world. In order to be clear, your beliefs do help to create your internal subjective experience. They do not create or control the external world or how or what the external world thinks of you. If a New-Ager is walking down the street and someone yells out, "Asshole," they might say to themselves, "I wonder why I created that" or "I wander if there are lessons to learn." This is both grandiose—i.e., "I create their actions"—and an age-regressed spiritual reframe—i.e., learning lessons, or some higher power (Mom/ Dad, school, etc.) is teaching me for some divine growth reason. Quantum Psychology would say that,you are not responsible for the person yelling out "asshole." But you are responsible for what you internally, subjectively create in response to their remark such as "Who cares," or "I'm going to kill them,'" or "I feel hurt."
