Dr. Marco Paret is the main world authority in the field of fascination. He has dedicated his career to uncovering and understanding the true nature of this powerful tool to which he was initiated by powerful masters. Through years of research and study, Dr. Paret has uncovered the secrets of hypnotic fascination and has developed new techniques to make it more accessible and easy to use for individuals of all backgrounds. Dr. Paret's work on fascination is particularly important in today's world, as the knowledge and practice of true magnetic tradition is increasingly rare. The power of hypnotic fascination is rooted in the ability to control the gaze and use it to create a connection between individuals. This connection can increase bonding and improve relationships, activate the ventral vagus nerve, and create a sense of imitation. The use of gaze in hypnotic fascination can also lead to faster hypnosis, catalepsy, and even the freeze response seen in animal hypnosis. Dr. Paret has also delved into the connection between fascination and the ancient practice of kundalini, the serpentine power within the human body.
