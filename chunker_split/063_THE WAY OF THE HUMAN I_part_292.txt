183 You (pointing to the present-time body) do that or the little girl identity (pointing to the image on the other side of the room) did that? I think that in order to stay connected with people that I do that still. That I monitor my energy to not offend or to not overwhelm or not be rejected or humiliated. Could you make the statement to the undertaker mother that the little girl had to monitor her energy so that you (mom) would not reject her or humiliate her? (To mom) The little girl had to contain her energy so that you wouldn't abuse her, so that you wouldn't humiliate her, so that you wouldn't reject her. It's like the little girl killed her energy for her mom. ________________ Therapeutic Note Here we are working with the "little girl's" trance-ference and fusion of mom onto everyone and the world, thus separating it again from her present time body! Nancy:Carefulness and cautiousness. Wolinsky:Okay, if this little girl identity over there fuses together mom and everybody, what experiences of energy is this little girl repressing or not allowing?
