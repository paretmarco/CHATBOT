In 1990 a good friend of his, Max, became interested in hypnotism and to find more about it he approached Virgilio Torrizzano who, he had heard used hypnotism from time to time, and very successfully. Max found out that Virgilio was working as a barber and went to see him. The shop was full of customers waiting to have their hair cut, so he waited until one customer got out of the barber’s chair when he approached Virgilio asking him could he tell him how hypnotism worked. He thought he might be able to make arrangements for them to meet in the future at another mutually convenient time. But he was in for a surprise because without saying a word to Max he turned to the waiting customers, asking them if they would agree to take part in a simple experiment he wanted to conduct. When they all agreed, although one of them did so rather reluctantly, he closed the shop door and fixed his gaze firmly upon the customer whose face showed he was far from happy at what was taking place; all he had was wanted was a haircut. But within seconds the customer’s obvious look of annoyance and defiance changed as Virgilio continued his fixed gaze and told him that the cigarette he was smoking tasted and smelled awful. The man then became doubled up in a paroxysm of coughing which was so violent Virgilio had to slap his face a number to bring him back to reality.
