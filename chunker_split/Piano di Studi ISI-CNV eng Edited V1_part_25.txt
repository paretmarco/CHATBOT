We use the most modern dynamics of NLP and NLP-3, Hypnotic Communication, and the many techniques taught exclusively by our institute including quantum. The course includes in fact in addition to the techniques of NLP and NLP-3, the updated methods Quantum Extreme ®, a revolutionary technology immediate that includes and goes beyond the previous ones, as it starts from a quantum approach, and develops "neural coherence" to increase the speed and brain power and mental energy with its own techniques. This allows faster learning and greater results. In each course theory and practice, intermittent to be able to offer an experiential education engaging and exciting. This first level of Training of Professional Practitioner of NLP-NLP-3-CNV consists of 2 modules of training: the Professional Practitioner of NLP-NLP-3 and the SEMINAR COACHING, for an excellent preparation. NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) is a technique very diffused today for change and improvement of communication skills and NLP3 is a further development of NLP toward quantum thinking, called NLP 3. NLP3 is based on many experiments and also on integration of not verbal technology. Each technique explained has been practiced and tested hundreds of times with success. It is a very efficient way of thinking and operating going beyond the paths of mainstream NLP. While for example in NLP we have the word “linguistic”, in NLP3 we put much more emphasis on non verbal behaviour as this is a fundamental key for the efficacy of our discipline.
