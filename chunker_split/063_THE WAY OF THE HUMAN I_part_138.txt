But if you put them back into a relationship or into the 80 Chapter VI world making a living, I don't care who it is, their uncooked seeds are going to sprout. That's why, when gurus come to the West, all of sudden they want money, sex, meditation centers, brochures and have a mission (from God). Unfortunately, most teachers or gurus rather than acknowledging their "uncooked seeds" go into the trance of spiritualization, (Dark Side of the Inner Child, Chapter 14). Sex becomes tantra, and desiring fame and money become a mission from God. In short, before you know it, all their uncooked seeds pop-up and then get spiritualized. So as you can see, it's easy for some gurus to say, "I am not tht doer" when everything is being done for them. In other words, their philosophy matches the context. There is a famous Sufi story about Sheik Nasudin. He was tending his flower garden and went inside for a moment. A goat chewed through the rope in the gardep and began to eat the flowers.
