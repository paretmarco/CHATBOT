Only through his look, this man, as related to us by Cicero, forced into silence the senator Curius (who was revered for the perfect eloquence of his speech), as the latter was launching an invective against him at the Roman Senate 92. Even what Napoleon exercised at the time when he came back from his exile in the Island of Elba represented a fascination carried out by the voice and the eye 93. King Louis XVIII had dispatched the Fifth Regiment against Napoleon. The latter accosted the regiment alone, dismounted from his horse, and said, looking straight at the components of that military unit: ‘Soldiers of the fifth regiment, you surely recognize who I am. If only one of you wants to open fire against the Emperor, he is free to do so now.’ After a brief interval when no one uttered a word, the soldiers broke into a shout of "Long Live the Emperor", and then marched to Paris along with him 94. The mere action of looking at someone, without anything further, is charged with meaning. It surely conveys a meaning of interest in such person.
