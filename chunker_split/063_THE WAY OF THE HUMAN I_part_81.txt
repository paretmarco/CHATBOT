QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: There is not one observer but an infinite number of them. With each experience a different observer-experiencer-experience arises and subsides. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: As in Quantum Physics so in Quantum Psychology, you cannot separate the observer from the observed or the knower from the known. The observer or knower is part of the observed or known experience; each is inseparable from the other. 39 The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THE OBSERVER IS PART OF THE OBSERVED A pivotal part of Werner Heisenberg's theory of Quantum Physics is the fact that the observer cannot be separated from the thing being observed. In the beginning phases, it is important to develop and observe, to realize that you are the looker and not what you are looking at, and that anything you can observe, you cannot be. Next, "you" see that the observer of the False Core Driver and the False Self Compensator itself are really one solid unit. In other words, the observer is part of that which it observes. Ultimately, you go beyond the observer-False Core-False Self complex and enter into ESSENCE-I AM and the NOT-I-I.
