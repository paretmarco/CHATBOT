How intuition can be developed Modern analysis says it is possible to learn how to develop intuition. That depends on building what has been termed an "informed instinct" 116. What it fundamentally means is that we do not rely on the most primitive instinct, which is the instinct of the inexperienced person. We rely on a higher level of functioning of the brain, one which does not take place in a wild fashion, but rather as a result of a specific process of development that is basically related to the experience one has accumulated. This experience is then processed in a special manner by our unconscious mind. Famous experts make use of this process. The financier George Soros recounts for instance the fact that, when the time for selling sets in, he perceives a "specific sensation" along the back, whereupon he comes to know that that is the best time for acting. Soros' experience in the field is vast. This large quantity of accumulated experience has enabled him to act in terms of very subtle “distinctions”, which allow the unconscious mind to function in an “informed manner”. Let us examine now the two essential aspects of the intuitive process.
