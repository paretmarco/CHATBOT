The man who tells you he does not believe in anything, save for the matters he has personally pondered and reflected about, thereby proves, by that very statement, that his mind is actually unable either to reason or think in a correctly heedful manner. If, in fact, he truly had the capacity to reflect and reason as he should, he would have undoubtedly recognized the fact that, in the course of his life, he had done and believed in several things he had failed to thoughtfully ponder at all, due to the simple fact that he had been influenced by someone else. He has lent credence to certain things because someone had told him they were true. It is far easier to give instructions on how to influence other people than on how to teach one to take precautions against being influenced by them. Method 2: Increasing one’s own presence. An alternative method consists in increasing your self-presencing. What it practically means is that you shall look at the person’s face while you simultaneously pay a great deal of attention to your own body.
