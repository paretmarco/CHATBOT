It is additionally possible, within the process of self-hypnosis, to learn new patterns of behaviour, and also, for whoever is prey to stress-related reactions, to develop self-control. Some people have compared the subconscious mind to a servomechanism which, after we have consciously learnt a certain experience, makes it its own, thereby enabling us to subsequently re-enact that experience more rapidly, and, especially, without even thinking about it. We have consciously mastered the way of driving a car, but now, whenever we are busy driving the different operations connected with it have become for us automatic motions to be made. That ensures we are no longer forced to focus our thought on them, and we are accordingly free to talk while driving. In the selfsame manner, we have learnt plentiful other ways of being related to the outside world, and we do not consciously inquire as to what we do; sometimes, our "automatic conduct" might be right, whereas on other occasions it might be wrong. Still, there are frequent times and situations where we act automatically.
