This inner child, which has received so much praise for so long, is a time frozen creation of the observer, you. The problem is that the time frozen inner child keeps creating unwanted trances, i.e., thoughts, feelings, emotions, sensations and strategies that no longer fit present-time situations. Conclusion The next step is to dismantle time-frozen, inner-child trances and realize that the individual is the observer and creator of this time-frozen inner-child identity. The purpose is to free ourselves from childhood survival mechanisms that no longer fit present-time relationships. The next step has three parts, 1) to acknowledge the dark side of the inner child which acts as a hypnotist in our present time self, 2) to look at this inner child identity, and release it from our present time reality, and 3) to awaken the observer (you), who has fallen asleep. This enables us to step out of our time-frozen past and step into being present in present time. .2 The Beginning of the End of the Dark Side of the Inner Child The recent emergence and popularity of therapies and self-help groups based on working on or with the "wounded inner child" has taken over the world of psychology.
