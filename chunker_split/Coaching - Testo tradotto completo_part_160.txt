2) A second and very effective tactic which might be employed for the sake of self-control is presentification, which consists in a supreme form of attention and an inferior form of mental magic. What happens in this instance is that we successfully witness ourselves carrying out useful actions and concentrating ourselves on them and on the satisfaction they bring about in us. This method is very effective if 1) is accompanied by relaxation, and 2) is implemented persistently. 3) Lastly, a third tactic for limiting those actions the abuse of which might cause harm to accrue to our persons (and which consist for the main part in those actions that are pleasing in nature) is learning the art of appreciation. The natural end-result of habits and abundance is that they bleach the value of whatever grants us pleasure. We should accordingly pause at every moment to consider the value of whatever pleasure we are about to taste, and, even more importantly, we should attentively study the intensity of our sensations, in the process refusing to subtract value from pleasant objects because of our incorrect enjoyment of them.
