Soon after he had discovered he could use instant mesmerism he travelled the length and breadth of Europe giving public demonstrations of his unique abilities, and fortunately, during one of his visits to Italy in 1886 an eyewitness reported what he did in L’Italia: ‘Donato looks at the young man quickly, brusquely, and from very close; the operator then turns the subject round and continues to fix him and provoke with his glance; the latter, as though attracted and fascinated, follows him with wide open eyes. ‘He experiments with about thirty young men, one by one... All of them respond immediately to the power of his fascination, by turning stiff throughout their bodies; their faces becoming contracted, terrified and sometimes cadaverous; they are at the mercy of the fascinator and following his movements like a magnet.....Donato has all of them under his power, he attracts them in threes, sixes, ten at a time, simply by rapidly staring at their eyes, even against their firm will and their obstinate efforts to resist...... Donato, in the process, never speaks,: he thinks, he wants and he points....’ (Donato’s Method – http:www.mesmerismus.info/info-2/inspirators-and-masters/metodo-donato.) A famous German medical hypnotist, Dr. Albert Moll of Berlin, also wrote Donato and ‘Fascination’ in his book Hypnotism (1890. Walter Scott, London) about ‘Fascination’.
