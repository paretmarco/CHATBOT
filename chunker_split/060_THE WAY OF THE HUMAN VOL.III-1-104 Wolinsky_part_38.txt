I think there is something about, I will have a lot of intense feelings and there have been beliefs that it wasn't okay to have a lot of feelings or to break down or to be impacted. Like death has a big impact and that's more selfish. There was a belief to be impacted by death was selfish. To be impacted by death was selfish? According to what or whom? My father. If you have grief, you are just being selfish. How did he put that together? Because the person who is dead is fine. They are dead. So you are feeling bad for yourself not for them. Any other presuppositions about death? I think in terms of a person to a person, it's final. That person is gone. I don't have a belief that I'm going to see them in heaven or in the light or in that kind of thing. There is a finality to it. It's a presupposition. It is final. Anything else? That it is a sad thing. Anything else? 31 That person will never exist for me. It challenges my sense of existence.
