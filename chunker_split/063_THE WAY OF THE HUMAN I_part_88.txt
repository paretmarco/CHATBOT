The goal is to take them apart through an enquiry into the assumptions and concepts you have so that eventually they and the "you" "you" call "yourself" disappear. One purpose of Quantum Psychology is that people will learn how to take these processes or ways of working, and internalize them so that they can begin dismantling their own False Core-False Self. Ultimately, the dismantler-dismantlee and the observer also will disappear, arid there will be no need for "me" or for Quantum Psychology any longer. Nisargadatta Maharaj said it this way, "I am not here to accumulate students." In fact, one of the many reasons this approach is called Quantum Psychology rather than "my'.' name is so that whether you love me or hate me, you can still do the work. It is not personal to "me," this approach is not about winning a popularity contest. IT TAKES TIME The False Core is so defended and the False Self so used to distract and compensate, determining one's False Core takes time.
