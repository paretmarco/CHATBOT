In the Hindu Yoga tradition, they refer to the world and what you call "you" as a "play of the elements" (i.e., air, earth, water, fire and ether). The forces, which they call gunas, contain Tama Guna (force) representing the inert force Sattva Guna (force) representing purity, and Raja Guna, (force) representing activity. According to Hindu Yoga everything (including us) occurs through the "play" (interaction) of the elements and the "play of the 86 Chapter III gunas (forces)." The Bhagavad Gita says that we are all subject to this play or interaction. Nisargadatta Maharaj once said to me, "Even the physical form of the Guru is subject to the play (interaction) of the Gunas (forces)." In other words, we, our bodies and all we think we are, are subject to, and part of, and are made from these interactions, but which ultimately are only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE not two (hence, Advaita).
