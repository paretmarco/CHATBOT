6263 The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum Psychology Wolinsky:Now, this little girl identity who had to do that, where do you feel her in your body? Debra:My face. Therapeutic Note Here, she is "acting out" of an age-regressed little girl Identity. Therefore, that also must be explored because it is her lens through which she sees the world and herself. Wolinsky:I would like for you to take the little girl's face off, here's mom and dad, and take that little girl mask off and put it just over there (separate from her present time body) so we have mom and dad and little girl. How do you feel looking at the triangle here, mom, dad, little girl and can you also experience your own ESSENCE. Debra:Yes. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINICLE: When the False Core Driver—False Self Compensator and Identities are separated then there is only ESSENCE. Wolinsky:Good. So as you look at me and as you feel part of your awareness on your own ESSENCE. Notice that we are separate and simultaneously be aware of your own ESSENCE.
