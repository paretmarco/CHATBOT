In the mysterious world of emotions, that many of us refuse, escape from or do not understand, there are deep mechanisms by which people lose responsibility for their actions that are automatic, so that they suffer or enjoy the results of their behaviour without realizing, until they get to the point where, if they are suffering, they attach the blame to somebody else according to their own strategies. Hypnosis is, therefore, a natural state that Man finds himself involved with in the act of living; s/he is able to bring it on or induce it in others, or s/he may experience it without knowing that it is called hypnosis. All kinds of efficient communication are hypnosis. It is a road that takes us to our mind, a fast path, sometimes rapid and sometimes steep. Hypnosis is the deep communication that you establish between two individuals. A hypnotist is a type of pilot who is able to alter a collision course in any of his passengers’ needs. The hypnotized individual is someone who allows himself to be hypnotized. In this state of consent, the left hemisphere becomes “surrounded” and in such a case, suggestions can be uncritically accepted by the subject and, consequently, translated into concrete actions. In a state of hypnosis, the subject’s will is not eliminated, it is as if the subject concedes a privileged audience to the hypnotist, lending him/ her maximum attention to what is being proposed, totally conserving his freedom to do or not do whatever is being suggested to him/ her.
