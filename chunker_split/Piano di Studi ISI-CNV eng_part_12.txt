In quantum terms the “magnetic chain” is an entanglement between the members of a group. In fact we observe certain phenomena when more persons work together on some issue. These effects have been also studied and labeled as “morphic field”: "The morphic fields include all kinds of organizing fields...: The organizing fields of animal and human behaviour, of social and cultural systems, and of mental activity can all be regarded as morphic fields which contain an inherent memory." According to the essential uses, customs and traditions of Magnetism and most particular Hermetic orders, which have been scrupulously preserved by our lineage, a recognized branch has the power to make and develop teaching about magnetism, according to the lineages that we preserve and all groups that continue them are inside the so called "magnetic chain" and are to be considered as regular and develop this “inner memory”. There are some specific points that are set for a group to be considered as regular in working with magnetism: 1 - not taking political or religious dogmatic point of view 2 - preserve and study the tradition respecting it and staying obviously in the lineage 3 - develop the work of presence 4 - divulge with respect to the discipline and of the other fellows practitioners 5 - adhere to the vaster group Mesmerismus ® -Magnetic Path First step of Magnetic Path Secrets of magnetic inductions The word Mesmerismus ® means connecting the forces of nature to his work and to his influence. Having these forces available, in creating the plan of his life, everyone can aim for the top.
