Pioneer family therapist Carl Whitaker (1989; Whitaker & alone,1987) first attempted to dispel this polarity by introducing Mtheconcept of "co-transference" (as opposed to the traditional dyad, transfcrenceicountertransfcrence). His message was, We're all in this together, we all project on each other, we all try to hide, we all try to manipulate, we arc all trying to grow. Now in his mid- seventies, Whitaker uses his lecturing circuit to "go crazy as the patient" for the audience, Whitaker's best times occur when he fully allows himself to "share his own craziness." Perhaps the most profound way fora person earning a living as a therapist to expand his or her inner context is to integrate and own the understanding that there is no difference between the therapist and the client. Ina training group in which I was discussing this idea I was asked,"Then, how do you know who's the therapist and who's the client?" My answer: "The person who gets paid is the therapist." That drew laughs, but I really did not intend it to be a humorous communication. On the contrary, 1 was quite serious.
