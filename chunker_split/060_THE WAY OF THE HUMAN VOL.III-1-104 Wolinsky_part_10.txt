The reason you do not experience your ESSENCE is because the label placed on it and the Essential quality of pure spaciousness are fused with your False Core. In other words, your ESSENCE is labeled as your False Core and the reason why there was a separation from the mother which eventually is trancefered onto everyone else, including the world and God. When we say it is the reason, actually it is blamed and then remains unknown that: it is the label placed on the SPACIOUSNESS of ESSENCE which then causes it to be (mis)perceived as emptiness as in a lack. Still ESSENCE is who they are essentially. Quantum Psychology sees Jung's Archetypical Shadow as not an Archetype at all, but rather as resisted parts of the id, which is then spiritualized during the creation of the persona (to be discussed later). 3 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology ESSENTIAL QUALITIES ESSENCE contains Essential qualities like love'with no object, observation with no object, spaciousness, compassion, peace, freedom, etc. Beyond all qualities is the no state state or I AM (see next chapter).
