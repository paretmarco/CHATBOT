In this way, the mother as a transformational person, is trance-ferred onto the teacher, guru, therapist, or psycho-spiritual system, turning them into the transformational mother (object). Noted psychoanalyst, Christopher Bollas (1987) says it this way: Special Section I wish to identify the infant's first subjective experience of the object (mother) as a transformational object. . . . Not yet fully identified as the other, the mother is experienced as a process of transformation, and the future lives on in the form of object seeking in adult life, when the object (person) is sought for its function as a signifier of transformation. Thus, in adult life, the quest is not to process [digest] the object (person); rather the object is pursued in order to surrender to it as a medium that alters the self. The mother is an environmental transformer of the subject (child). The memory of this early object relation manifests itself in the person's search for an object (a person, place, event, or ideology) that promises to transform the self.
