It is therefore necessary to know how to circumscribe the field of one’s activity. No better means to accomplish this requirement exists than to set out beforehand the issues that one is going to deal with within a fixed time, accompanying that step by the firm resolution to tackle each of those issues exhaustively. By resorting to our method, after all, we will gain a huge surplus of free time we can then devote to supererogatory researches. What is in fact the origin of so many agitating states and so many useless speeches? It is the fact they are detached, in other words, that they are not carried out so as to serve a specific purpose. If, by contrast, we set a particular aim for ourselves, however negligible it might be, so long as it is a clear and immediate aim, our actions and our thoughts will naturally bind themselves together in a chain-like arrangement, causally related to one another, and, as a result, all of them will occupy a useful place. We would like to draw the learner’s attention to the necessity that any such purpose should be quite clear.
