When the experimenter has hypnotized the subject in some other way, and has made him open his eyes, he can fix his own steadily on them, and thus induce the same phenomena. A variety of this fascination is to fix the eyes of the subject on some other object—for example, on the finger of the experimenter. In this case the fascinated person follows every movement made by the finger. Let’s see now THE MEETINGS OF DONATO The first thing Donato after greeting the public by entering the stage is to examine the composition of the room. Whilst acknowledging the radiant intelligence on the forehead or in the eyes of many, he is quiet, as he is sure to be appreciated, and then his voice takes the softest tones, he is insinuating with dignity. His gaze is always tan, but do not throw vivid light. His words caress.
