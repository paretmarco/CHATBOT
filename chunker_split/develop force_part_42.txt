Having managed this exercise, make an effort to have (always in the brain) the exact sensation of entire leg, going forward, and later even the feeling of the whole body that moves. Exercise 16. Touch. Take any object: e.g. a pencil, a paper holder, a watch. The exercise consists in determining mentally the exact sensation the object gives to your touch: its shape, the feeling of weight or heat, du-safety, etc. To simplify the exercise begin to determine one at a time the feelings of the various qualities of the examined object; then you can reach (but only hardly, and after a long workout) the contemporary and comprehensive determination of all the sensations of touch. Exercise 5. The view. 1. Open and close rapidly, the buffet of your dining room and describe the number and quality of the objects that you have seen. 2. Pass quickly in front of a storefront and make inventory as above. Exercise 18. The hearing. Note: this exercise is not only an excellent training for concentration, but is also an excellent gym of the mind. Bring your attention exclusively on a chosen among many noises affecting your ear: e.g. the noise of the tram passing, the tick of a clock, etc. You have to concentrate to the point of not having in your mind anything else but the sensation of this noise: do not think to the tram or the clock, but the noise they make. The described exercises you must perform in the solitude of your room at the beginning.
