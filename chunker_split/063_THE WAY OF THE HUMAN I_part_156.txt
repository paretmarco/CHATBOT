and continued, "Notice that there is a space that opens up after the question, Who is this IT" To repeat, anything that you believe about yourself is limiting: "I feel good," "I feel bad," "I'm tall, short, fat, thin, ugly." Whatever thought comes into mind that you identify with will limit you, it doesn't matter what the content is. "I like it here," "I love myself," "I hate myself'â€”they are all thoughts. When a thought arises like, "I feel good," ask, "To whom does this thought arise?" Answer, "To me." Then ask, "Who is this I?" Begin to notice that there's a space at the end of that question. Notice that space. When "I" was in India, "I" used to start meditation at 3:00 a.m. One morning "I" was meditating in the cave and a thought came by, "It's an uphill battle all the way." It arose very gently.
