It is commonly known in the examples of the "chicken hypnotism", where a chicken will stay blocked in a state of tonic immobility looking at a line or in "snake charming". Even some animals are able to practice similar power on other animals, but only man is capable to use it for fostering his personal development. At the end of 1800, hypnotizer Donato went through whole Europe demonstrating this technique with incredible efficiency. It was as fast as lightning. However, after his death, his techniques became unknown. The first time I (Dr. Paret) and my fellow researcher Dr. Tira assisted to a real fascination induction without words we were really stupefied. It was conducted by Virgilio Torrizzano, a man that had been initiated in this amazing ancient tradition. In less than 4 seconds the subject was with the eyes wide open and completely receptive, even to non verbal suggestions. After this encounter, we became friends with Virgilio and we asked him to teach us how he did it. For many years thereafter we have been searching to unveil the secrets and the true methodology behind this power, dating in its history back to the Egyptians.
