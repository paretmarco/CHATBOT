Direct your attention to the area of your navel. Ask your unconscious side to give you an affirmative or a negative reply through a slight motioning (by the fingers). Determine beforehand which finger corresponds to the "yes" answer. Ask your unconscious now whether it is able to hear. After a while, you will notice in your finger a movement taking place spontaneously. At that point, you might submit some questions to your deep inward being. This exercise might prove to be easy for some persons, whereas other people might need the assistance of a hypnotist capable of guiding them. This is one of the best exercises so as to nurture a relationship with oneâ€™s unconscious. The more, in fact, we develop a dialogue with it, the greater the ability of the unconscious to deepen and expand. The exercise is likewise useful for the sake of establishing a priority between different possible actions. Exercise 41: Verification of ideas and ideals Using again the method of the inner code, you should now verify once more the correlation of the previously demarcated ideas and ideals with your own selves.
