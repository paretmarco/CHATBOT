The emphasis on a spiritual group, however, could be better served by each individual taking responsibility for his trances. Stated another way, P.D. Ouspensky, noted Fourth Way teacher, called psychology the study of lies. Each one of us is responsible for the lies he/she erects and tells to herself. A true spiritual warrior needs to look at, acknowledge and dismantle these lies. This takes great courage. It is not for me to say whether or not you are lying to yourself and spiritualizing; that is your job. I am attempting to point out possible pitfalls that I have observed within myself. Recently workshop participants asked me why there was such a lack of integrity in the world. I said, "Lies and integrity are not black or white. Integrity begins inside oneself, not outside oneself. The more you lie to yourself, the more you lie to others." In the ancient yoga system, called Raja Yoga, the first prelimi- nary steps ask the participant to not lie. This is really about not telling lies to yourself to avoid pain. Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to uncover at all costs the lies you tell yourself, no matter how small.
