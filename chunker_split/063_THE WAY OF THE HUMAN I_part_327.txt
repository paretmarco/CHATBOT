She said to me that she no longer felt sexual, that she was so spiritual now she had "gone beyond" sexual desire, not realizing sexuality is hard wired into the nervous system's survival of the species. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, a dissociative observer had emerged to defend against the pain and thus she lost her present-time body and her sexuality. She then labeled this process as spiritual. Also she had become grandiose by beginning to promote herself as a spiritual teacher/guru. This is the trance of the dissociative observer, who spiritualizes the dissociation which in this situation was created to defend against the pain of her relationship breaking up. Quantum Psychology has set aside several principles relating to the dissociative observer. (How to dismantle the observer will be discussed in Volume III, "Beyond Quantum Psychology.") 212 Special Section QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the fear of loss of self, the greater the power of the dissociative observer. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the trauma or the unmet biological needs of the child, the greater the tendency for a dissociative observer to emerge.
