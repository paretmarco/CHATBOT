If I don't need it, I won't get it. I would say to my parents, "I want a new bike." My parents would say, "You don't need a new bike; if you needed it, we would give it to you." this is interpreted by the infant/child as God gives me what I need, with the spiritualization that when something doesn't come that you want, "I guess God didn't want me to have it, or "I guess I didn't need it." Notice how the infant/child within the adult spiritualizes that God decided I didn't need it. It's as if God said, "Give Stephen money, he needs it," or "Don't give him money; he needs to learn a lesson." Transpersonal Co-dependence In this third level process, the child pleases and serves the parents in order to get taken care of. Psychologically, the child inside a woman might believe "I'll take care of you (help you through medical school), so that you'll take care of me."
