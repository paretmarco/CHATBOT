An important component of this stage is your conscious focusing on whatever you do. First Phase = Attention and conscious Focalizing That is however insufficient: As in every other creation, even of a material type, one has to have both form and content. The content is provided by the preparatory work on the strength of which the largest possible quantity of raw material is readied, while the form derives from the unconscious which elaborates such material. Second Phase: Preparation demands attention, whereas, by contrast, ideation needs relaxation. No crystal is formed inside a glass of pure water; if, however, you insert in it a salt until the point of saturation is reached, shaking it, boiling it, in short, doing all that is necessary in order to saturate a liquid, you will obtain the conditions that are suitable to the process of crystallization. For that to occur, however, you must then allow your water to rest. Life is a rhythmic oscillation of activity and rest.
