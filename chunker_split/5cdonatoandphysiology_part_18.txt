My will to end quickly, energetically expressed by my gesture and my glance, impressed the subject, who went to sleep with an astonishing rapidity. Excited by success I tried to provoke sleep more and more rapidly, in three minutes, in two minutes, finally in one single minute, and my success was complete. One evening in Liege (Belgium) in 1874, finding myself in a cafe, he overheard a young lawyer—M. Cudell—who denied my power and attempted to turn me into ridicule. Indignant and furious I placed myself before him and without braggadocio but with a profound conviction I announced to him that with a single glance I would make him fall backward. My audacity paralyzed his mind and succumbing to the power of my will he immediately rolled to the earth. Another time I attended Madame Michele (also at Liege, which is my native town), who had a stroke of paralysis. Her companion expressed doubts as to the efficacy of my curative power. Finally, somewhat irritated, I said: "Mademoiselle Lronie, to prove to you my power I will paralyze your legs by a gesture. You can walk no more."
