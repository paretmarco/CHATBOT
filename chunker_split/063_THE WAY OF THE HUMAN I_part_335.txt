Psychologist Stephen Johnson says it this way, describing noted Self Psychologist Heinz Kohut's position on the twinship transference: 216 Special Section Kohut (1971) posits that the "twinship" transference is somewhat more evolved developmentally than the merger transference just outlined. Here, separateness is acknowledged but the individual assumes that he and the object (mother) have more or less identical psychologies with similar likes, dislikes, and philosophies, etc. The maintenance of this illusion is necessary for the maintenance of significant relationships. The discovery that another is not "just like me" even in some insignificant respect is enough to threaten the relationship. The twinship attachment, together with its fragility, is often seen in early teenage romances, where part of the function of the attachment is the discovery of self. The currently popular literature on "soulmates" seems to me, at times at least, to perpetuate this transferential relationship based upon the search for the perfect alter ego (Johnson, 1987). This twinship trance-ference negates separation. For that reason, the individual sees their partner as a twin, and goes into the spiritualized trance, calling the: relationship partner a soul mate.
