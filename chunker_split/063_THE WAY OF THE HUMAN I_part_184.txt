To paraphrase a tantric text called the Spanda Karikas, when you're feeling extremely happy or joyful, or extremely sad or angry, or you are running for your life, if at that moment you could become introverted, you would experience Spanda, which is the divine pulsationor throb. Of course, what they leave out is, if at that moment you could remember to become introverted! I realized I needed tc) do that, to de-label my story and experience it as energy. I focused on the anger as energy and went into bliss. This is what can happen with this exercise. It's critical, however, to experience the emotion as energy without the intention of getting rid of it. If you are trying to get rid of it, you are resisting it, which keeps it there. As you can see, it takes some practice to move your attention away from the story, to let it go and focus on the fear itself. But once you're able to do ihat, you'll see how emotions lose a lot of their power.
