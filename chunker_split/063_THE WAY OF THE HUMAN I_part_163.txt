Swami Prakashananda once said, "You can't even control very much the next time you're going to go to the bathroom. So let happen what happens. You WITNESS." A Quantum Psychology principle is that in every thought there is an observer of the thought, a knower of the thought and a thinker of the thought. In other words, it is an illusion to imagine that there is a thought and a thinker of the thought. There is just thinking, the observer and the knower and the thinkerof the thought are contained within the thought itself. The basic principle of Kashmir Shaivism, which is the second aphorism of the Shiva Sutras, is Jnanam Bandhah: "Knowledge is bondage." It says that anything you know (about yourself or the world) will bind you. You think you're smart; you think you're strong; you think you're unlovable; you think you're spiritual; you think you're worthless. Whatever it is, what you know about yourself will limit your experience. Knowledge therefore is bondage. EXERCISE #6 Step I: Notice a thought or feeling you are having.
