Stephen H. Wolinsky 144 The Way of the Human • Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness he purpose of the Nervous System is to organize chaos. Moshe Feldenkrais 138 Chapter VIII THE SHOCK It is the shock of the Realization of Separation and deprivation which causes the break in your awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE. Please note that this separation story is a story, a theory to explain what or why. However, it is a symbolic representation of what is—not what is. This, in turn, creates your False Core and your psychology (see Volume II). This is also sometimes mirrored in the images we have of our biology. And that an infant's learning to stand up and face the world is inhibited at a psychological level by the False Core (psychology). The False Core as a representation mirrors the loss of awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE rather than the biology minoring the psychology. In Reichian therapy, it is said that all neurosis is caused by an interruption in the body's ability to discharge excess energy. Reich said that this inability forces the energy upward into thoughts, and then forces those thoughts even `higher" upward toward the head (cortex) and above.
