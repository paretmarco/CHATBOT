The direction which personal improvement takes, as far as the trader is concerned, is always a creative direction, that is, a direction of accessing our own resources: It is absolutely necessary, therefore, to ensure that every effort is aimed at creativity, as opposed to a mere spirit of competitiveness vis-à-vis the external environment. The truth is in fact that forcing ourselves to move along a direction of mere competition with the world (as with the person who says, ‘I want to fare better than my colleague X!’) has only the effect of letting us employ the resources which are already available in a different manner, without taking us, however, to the point where we might create novel resources. Given that the process of utilizing resources which are already there is essentially rational and conscious, that process distances us from the possibility of finding a successful outlet for our subconscious resources: Though we might no doubt manage to achieve temporary results, we simultaneously risk focusing upon erroneous directions, thereby laying waste to several possibilities.
