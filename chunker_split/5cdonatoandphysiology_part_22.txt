From the moment that a patient has given proof of submission by following my eyes in my first process, as in remaining nailed to the ground in my second, I can almost always make him go through the successive phases which I will mention succinctly, without entering into details of intermediate periods, of which the description would be too long. 1. With a word, a look, a significant gesture I make him walk and move backward in spite of himself. I arrest his arm if he wishes to strike, his hand if he wishes to write, and his legs if he wishes to walk. I render him numb or mute, etc. I obtain these results by provoking different forms of paralysis. The subject is in no way asleep; he possesses full consciousness of his acts and, brought back to the normal state by a word or a breath, he can relate the different experiments he has submitted to. 2. By degrees in the course of the experiments the power of a fixed idea takes complete possession of a subject; his psychic individuality is effaced, and he ends by being absorbed in me.
