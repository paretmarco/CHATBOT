Therefore, it is not so much the force of oneâ€™s ingenuity as the strength of maintaining self-consciousness and presence to ourselves, of sticking to the exigencies that our specific task demands, and adapting without delay to the different circumstances with the same speed whereby a liquid adapts to the vase it is poured into without loosing its own intrinsic nature, that gifts us the key to success. Not only that, as it is in fact such strength that also marks the summit of human evolution. The said tragic fight between the inward being and the outward self represents the entire inner drama of existence. The price of freedom and the value of life consist in the effort of gradually freeing our essential inward being from the egotistic and fickle self, and in forcing the latter back to its mere function of an instrument. Our egotistic and individual self is the one which creates in us the desire for comfortable idleness, leisure and shortcuts. It is precisely this self, which identifies itself with its own things, with its characteristic comfort zone, that precludes us from clearly discerning the direction we should proceed along.
