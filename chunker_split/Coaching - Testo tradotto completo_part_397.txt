Grant him only your partial attention, and make sure to frequently deflect your look elsewhere. Do not look down, only somewhere else; implementing this method will allow you to ponder what he is actually saying. Those people who have not thoroughly studied this issue normally assume that, when a man is talking to you, and you are turning your look aside, your attitude must be due to the fact that your interlocutor has got you in his grips, and is thus exercising over you some mastery forcing you to look away from him. That is however a false viewpoint on the issue. If you are looking somewhere else, it is only because you are seeking to protect your own selves in the process. It is thus no coincidence that a number of branches of psychology (such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming), have studied the way in which ocular movements become linked to reflection. The mere step of making some room for yourselves has the capacity to grant you the opportunity to reflect and reason things out.
