It could then be said that the ice cubes contain only the characteristics that were contained within that "piece" or "section" of condensed water (ice). The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS appears as condensed EMPTINESS from the point of view of an "I" (which is condensed EMPTINESS too) and is mistakenly called the individual soul. But according to Buddha, "There is no individual soul which transmigrates (incarnates) from lifetime to lifetime." This realization is what differentiates Hinduism from Buddhism. ESSENCE is the last "state" that has "qualities" that can somehow be termed "individual." As was previously mentioned, an infant might have energetic-genetic proclivity toward a False Core. But infants are fairly "unconditioned" and so they are very close to ESSENCE. If you look in the unconditioned eyes of newborn babies, they seem to express a sense of ESSENCE. This is why people coo and ah around babiesâ€”their being in ESSENCE evokes the open heartedness of another's ESSENCE. When the realization of the separation between mother and infant occurs, ESSENCE is blamed and the False Core label is placed upon it (see Volume II).
