It is an Enlightenment prison which limits what you can or cannot do, say, think, have, experience, know, and discuss. In short, it is the maintenance of a "state" and as a basic Buddhist teaching of impermanence saysâ€”all states and everything are impermanent." Or as Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, "Who came first, you or the state?" Saying further, "What do you care what state you are in? I am not in a state." Quantum Psychology is interested in liberating and stabilizing awareness by cooking the uncooked seeds of your False Core-False Self. The ideal for now, but not meant as a goal to be achieved, is to live your life and have awareness of all dimensions simultaneously until naturally awareness itself disappears (Volume III). In other words, the liberation of awareness naturally becomes a function of awareness. Awareness can then be in any dimension, all dimensions or no-dimensions. Eventually awareness goes beyond awareness itself as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS absorbs the "you" you call yourself. "Then" the VOID ends, or voids itself, and the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE is revealed.
