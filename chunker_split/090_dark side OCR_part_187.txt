Below are cases that illustrate methods of working with oneself, and are guides to the next step of dismantling the inner child' s automatic sensory distortion, and awakening the observer. Type 1- Emotional Sensory Distortion A 250-pound man came to see me. He requested therapy for obesity. As we began the therapy, he spaced out, disconnected and then felt his body was like a stone (sensory distortion). He had no sensations. I suggested he feel a sensation and then experience a space, and another sensation and a short space, and a sensation and a long space. (There are spaces that often go unnoticed between sensations). Eventually, the undifferentiated mass (his body) began to throb or pulsate. He began to take charge of the "rock-dead" feeling of protection and lengthened or shortened the gaps or spaces between sensations, by himself. Lengthening the gap would slow or lessen the sensations, shortening the gap heightened sensations. The result for the client was increased energy and a greater "feeling of his body," instead of his old pattern of withdrawal into denial, to avoid sensation.
