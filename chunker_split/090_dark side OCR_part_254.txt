Systems therapy, structural and strategic therapy assume specifically that any and all experi- ences are context-dependent, or relate only to the situation in which a behavior happens and occurs. These systems postulate that when you change the interactions of the family or the context in which a problem occurs, the problem leaves. In these theories it is the context that permits the emergence of a problem; this ignores the individual. My approach integrates both you, the individual, and your inner world (intrapersonal), with others (interpersonal context) so that both models can live peaceably together. For this purpose I will define "trigger" as something in the environment that pushes the button that creates the unwanted trance response of the inner child. As an example, a woman who came to see me had been sexually abused in her childhood. This experience generalized. The trigger called "Dad" generalized to all men, and created an internal fear reaction. Her muscles tightened, and she experienced emotional shutting down. To be in the trance state of the inner child itself requires a shrinking of the focus of one's attention, and doing that means resources normally available to an adult are not accessible.
