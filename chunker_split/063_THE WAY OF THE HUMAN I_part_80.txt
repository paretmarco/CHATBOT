In Trances People Live, I called the False Core the Organizing Principle since it is the principle that 38 Chapter 11 organizes your entire psychology. When that False Core or Organizing Principle dissolves (a Yogi would call it "cutting the knot of the heart"), ESSENCE, I AM, VOID, etc., naturally emerge and are revealed. If you do not cut the False Core (knot of the heart, i.e., the associational networks), ESSENCE, the I AM and the awareness of the VOID (NOT-I-I) can never be stabilized in your awareness. TRACING THE FALSE CORE DRIVER To discovertyonr False Core, take notice of whatever it is you are experiencing and then trace it back by asking yourself, "What is the worst of that or "what about that is so bad?" When you trace it back, you'll hit thebottom of one of them. Please note there are more False Cores than those described. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY' PRINCIPLE: Who you are is beyond even the way "you" fixate your attention. The way "you" fixate attention and all "you" call "you" are part of the observer-False Core Driver-False Self Defensive Compensator complex.
