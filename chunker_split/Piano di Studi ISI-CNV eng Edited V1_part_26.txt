While in traditional NLP we have the word “programming”, NLP3 has the goal to pave the way to the “quantum thinking” that it is completely different from programming. In Quantum thinking the mind is free. • If you are an NLPer, this is your occasion of learning something new that will further enhance your efficacy. • If you are new, you will start with the right foot. Most of the most successful teachers and practitioners use, at least unconsciously, many elements written in this book. Personally we find this methodology simpler in application than the old ones. In our centres we train psychotherapists and hypnotherapists, and we practice as well personal therapies, coaching etc… This is as a new discipline based on recent researches and on the successes we have got. Please, throw away all your past mental conditioning and open your mind to new frames of thinking: what you find here is the result of our experience! We explain it with a theoretical framework around the lines of Enneagram, NLP and other techniques as we have found these frameworks highly effective both for us as for our students. Welcome to the new world! This course can be thought as composed of two parts: first part about the non verbal communication, Enneagram and NLP-3 framework (first day and half) and second part as relating more to techniques and hypnotic application. The two parts can be followed independently INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATION This course will give you an international certificate of NLP-3. Investment: Real Value of the course: 1800 euros.
