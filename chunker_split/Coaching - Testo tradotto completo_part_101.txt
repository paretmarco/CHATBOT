It corresponds to the “Quantum” part of the mind A characteristic aspect of the quantum part of the mind (which corresponds to unconscious processes and is activated by gaining access to our essential inward being) is that it is capable of encompassing more than one map simultaneously, and possesses the intrinsic ability to establish powerful connections. It allows one’s reasoning process to unfold itself on a multiplicity of planes at one and the same time. In order for this reasoning to be effective, it must take place unconsciously. Central connections Massive capacity, in need of minimal effort We cannot gain direct knowledge of what it is busy doing without blocking it The quantum part of the mind intervenes more often than what we might think. The truth is in fact that we lack consciousness of most of what we do: The majority of our perceptions are after all automatic in nature, and automatic perception is actualized by our unconscious. "The neurons involved when we feel something become active even prior to actually receiving any sensory input". Cf. Jeff Hawkins, “On Intelligence” (2004).
