While he was alive, only one of his books was published, called I Am That. This was his most impor- 16 Chapter tant work. He was into Advaita Vedanta (Advaita Sanskrit for non-duality) and Jnana yogi (Sanskrit for knowledge, the path of knowledge), but actually it is the PATH OF UNLEARNING. Advaita contends that there is only ONE SUBSTANCE, that everything is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, not two or more substances, and that is all spirituality really is, and YOU ARE THAT ONE SUBSTANCE (Volume III). Because of Quantum Psychology's relationship to Nisargadatta Maharaj, it is directed toward enquiry and dismantling, not fixing, transforming or healing, the False Core-False Self's psychology. The process is organized through internal questioning and enquiry. In Quantum Psychology, we want to reduce the amount of awareness placed on, and consumed by, "your" psychology, in this way liberating your awareness until the enquirer-enquiree and awareness itself disappear in the non-dimensionality of the underlying unity of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, Quantum Psychology is an extension and continuation of Nisargadatta Maharaj—i.e., Advaita Vedanta—and it has several premises which form its basic core.
