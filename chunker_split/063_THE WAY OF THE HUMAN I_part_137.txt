As mentioned before, you might be living your life and have everything going well for you. But then you get involved with somebody sexually and all of a sudden the external context changes and all your unresolved issues (uncooked seeds) come up. The best metaphor "I" know to describe this phenomenon is from India and it is called Uncooked Seeds. To explain, if I have seeds and I put them in the ground and water them, I will soon get plants which bear fruit But if I first take the seeds, put them in a frying pan and cook them, and then put them in the ground, they won't grow or bear fruit. Awareness is the heat that cooks uncooked seeds (unprocessed) concepts. In this way, Quantum Psychology uses awareness as the stove to cook the uncooked seeds (beliefs, concepts, points of view, etc.,) so that they no longer sprout. Going back to our guru, this is what happens. If they sit alone somewhere in a cave, there is no issue. It's really easy to be pure awareness with your eyes closed while people bring you whatever you need.
