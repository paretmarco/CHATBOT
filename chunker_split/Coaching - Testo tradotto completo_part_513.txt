In order for the mind to be able to reason and give expression to its results, it is in fact necessary that it should be able to work out distinctions which are built through experience. It is somewhat similar to the scenario where, in order to make some order in our house, we opted to make use of a series of differently coloured boxes instead of indiscriminately throwing all items into one single box. Many traders do not make suitable distinctions, and lack knowledge on how to train their mind to develop such process. If we were to use quantum terms, we would refer to "observables". An "observable" is, in essence, the defining of a possible result. The definition of observables is of fundamental importance to the task of avoiding the danger of thought drifting away unchecked, in the same way that, if we do not have boxes where we might place objects, we would be disabled from "ordering" reality. The ideal would be for all the boxes to be filled in a balanced manner, so as to eschew the situation where some of them remained empty while others were filled beyond capacity.
