Each eye can have normal acuity (20/20 vision) but unless the eyes team, visual functions are impaired; <in observing very fast one eye after the other it seems that we alter binocular functions. AWAKENING LEFT SIDE OF VISION - WORKING ON THE LEFT EYE HANDS AS VISUAL CUE TO INCREASE ATTENTION USING PERIPHERAL MOVEMENTS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF BODY POSITION Moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can result in affecting the sense of balance. Different visual areas contribute to the processing of visual information coming from different parts of the visual field, and a complex of visual areas located along the banks of the inter hemispheric fissure (a deep groove that separates the two brain hemispheres) has been linked to peripheral vision. It has been suggested that these areas are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery, and monitoring body position relative to gravity (Palmer SM, Rosa MG (2006).
