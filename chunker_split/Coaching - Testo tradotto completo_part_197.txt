Every day must simultaneously be a masterpiece in itself, complete in itself and capable of expressing a self-contained purpose. Limiting ourselves to solely giving effect to our devoted commitment, in fact, leads to absurd results and to certain failure, since in that case life would only be lived for the sake of such commitment. Life, however, is a right, not a mission. To live in time, understood as Kairòs, further denotes the ability to seize the opportunities which life offers us. It is indeed possible that such opportunities will open up new ways. It is accordingly necessary to acquire the knowledge of how to inject energy into the now, and how to be effectively able to live the moment. Whereas linear time is born out of planning, “Kairòs” is an intuitive time in a state of “connection” and “re-integration” with one’s own being. This acting does not consist in a static reality, contrary to what takes place when the mind becomes blocked. The opposite is in fact true: This form of acting represents a higher plane of functioning.
