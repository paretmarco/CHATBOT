As mentioned earlier, the complaint of anxiety is imagining a catastrophic outcome and experiencing distress now. This trance of the dark side of the inner child takes place as the child sees trauma in his life. The child assumes that this is how life will always be. As an adult, the child within the adult continually "pops-up" catastrophies and thinks they are real. The result is pain and suffering in present time. Here, past catastrophies are projected into the future. 2. Fantasizing In this style of the futurizing trance, the child imagines a pleasant outcome in the future. The pleasant imagined outcome helps protect the child from the distressing, ongoing interactions in the family. For example, a child imagines herself waiting "for her ship to come in," or imagines her talent being "discovered," or fantasizes a time when she will be "taken care of." Problems arise when the child within the adult stays "stuck" and continues to imagine the unrealistic idealized future. A woman I once saw for therapy was in a relationship with a man for years and was always frustrated. She wanted him to take care of her.
