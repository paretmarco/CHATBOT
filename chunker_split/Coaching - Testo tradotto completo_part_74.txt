Knowing how to aim at a specific target and to precisely delineate it Let us now speak of a problem that is frequently encountered: When one works towards accomplishing a purpose which is not immediately tangible, when, for example, one is studying a particular issue, what occurs is that, due to the concatenation of ideas, although we do not actually exit the ambit of that subject-matter, we nevertheless enlarge its scope to such an extent that we can no longer perceive its demarcating boundaries: What is accessory turns into the main aspect, and it in turn creates further ancillary investigations, and so on and so forth. What is occasioned thereby is a new kind of cerebral vagrancy which scholars are not cognizant of. They lack awareness of such cerebral roving because, though they believe they are deepening their devotion to the particular subject they are with busy with, they are in actual fact dilating and thus scattering it. That is also what often happens to the person who navigates through the Internet without any precise purpose; one page summons another one, and, at the end of the day, nothing has been done and nothing has been achieved.
