As an adult, the abuser-part of the child within projects the child who was abused on other children, and abuses them. It is the dark side or abuser-part of the inner child (inside the adult) which feels the compulsion to abuse. The abuser child within is on automatic and out of control as an adult. This is the power of the dark side of the inner child. Recently, a physician sent me a client he described as "spiri- tual." When I saw her, she complained of two problems: (1) she couldn't feel, and (2) the voices in her mind were telling her she was bad, evil. So, "I hate myself," she said. At first, she gave me this very long story about how she left her body and floated to the top of the room. This part of her was her spirit. (See Chapter 14, Spiritualization). I asked her, "Were you ever physically or sexually abused?" She said, "Yes, my stepfather would beat me mercilessly while verbally abusing me." I said, "When did you start leaving your body?"
