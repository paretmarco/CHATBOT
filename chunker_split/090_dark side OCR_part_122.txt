Blocking-out occurs when the development or survival of the child is dependent upon not seeing, hearing, feeling or even know- ing (see Chapter 12, Amnesia) what is occurring. Blocking-out is created by the child in the family context by a series of interactions as the child develops. Blocking-out can be continued by the family and later the spouse. For example, an alcoholic man who abuses his wife might suggest she block out his drinking or abuse. This could be a continuation of the suggestions of her parents that saved her as a child, "Don't see the drinking." Often times, the observer models the inner child within her mother, and creates a duplicate inner child within the adult, not seeing her father drinking. This child assumes that's how one handles drinking, the way mom modeled; by blocking-out. The child models Mom's trance. It is no wonder that as an adult she will not see her husband drinking and might even enable him to drink more. Often in therapy I ask clients, "Who was the model for that trance? ", or "Who demonstrated this technique of survival? i.e., blocking-out."
