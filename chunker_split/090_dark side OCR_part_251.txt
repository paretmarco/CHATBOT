He no longer was resisting that void or chaos. Another example was a woman medical doctor who came to see me, suffering from obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behavior. This included everything from work to relationships. She sought my help because after having left her home at 19 to get married, and a divorce after 25 years of marriage, she had gotten immediately into another relationship. Now as this new relationship of four years was ending, she was in terror. Once again we processed through the identities and strategies of the past and present, but the terror still remained. Once again, I was struck by her resistance to the empti- ness, which she felt was always there as a threat. Her obsessive-compulsive tendency was a way to resist the void by trying to fill it up. We worked through the impossibility of filling up the void, and as she began allowing the emptiness rather than resisting it, the terror subsided. She felt calm and at peace. Further- more, in addition to the terror leaving and the obsessive-compulsive attempts to fill up the emptiness leaving, her fear of being alone, which was associated with the emptiness, also departed.
