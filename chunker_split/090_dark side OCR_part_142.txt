Children often imagine stardom, but if they stay connected to the world in present time, they know when they can't play the guitar (feedback), and can't be Eric Clapton. In more severe cases, there is no feedback loop. Instead, the child goes into a child-to-child trance, cut off from present-time feedback (can't playguitar), and, years later, feels pain. Principle V: An observer relating to the world makes trances trans-lent and part of growing up. If the child does not shift to the feedback from the world because of the horror of a dysfunctional family, the child shifts to a child- to-child trance. Years later the child within hypnotizes the adult. This creates the adult' s illusions. Many people have illusions about being a movie or rock and roll star. This seems to be quite common. This is a way the child resists experiences in the family that are too painful to integrate at the time. Problems arise when the illusions become solid, and interpersonal feedback is cut off. For example, I wanted to play basketball for the Boston Celtics. By 13, I realized that I was going to be too small.
