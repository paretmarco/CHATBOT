Try to find the self that's having associations or memories, and notice the associationer is part of the association, no separate person having the associations or memories. Just memories or associations passing through the VOID. Notice hearing and the hearer. Try to find the self that's hearing, and notice the hearer is contained within the hearing. Notice there is no separate self hearing, that the hearER is contained within the hearing itself. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology It soon becomes obvious that there is no separate self, that a feeling, thought, or association, etc., arises with the experiencER or knowER of it. THE CONCEPT OF A SELF IS CONTAINED IN THE THOUGHT ITSELF. At that moment the phenomenon disappears, and there is justness.
