How to deepen and cultivate awareness of these different dimensions so that we can become aware of all eight dimensions of our humanness. COLLAPSING THE LEVELS In the early chapters of The Way of the Human "I" discussed eight levels or dimensions of manifestation and awareness. The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out WHO YOU ARE. The possible first step is to liberate your awareness by first developing the,ability to maintain multi-dimensional awareness and then to ultimately go beyond awareness itself. The liberation of awareness could be an aid in the discovery of "WHO YOU ARE." Unfortunately, this discovery is greatly inhibited because awareness gets habitually fixated and shrunken. Awareness can be fixated at the external dimension, thinking dimension, emotional dimension, and at the biological dimension. Awareness can even become fixated at the level of ESSENCE. Although being fixated on ESSENCE might at first seem wonderful, it can lead to problems on different dimensions. For example, being unconditionally loving, an essential aspect, is great, but if you lack awareness of the external world, then people could rip you off. I recently met a woman in Germany who was going through a divorce.
