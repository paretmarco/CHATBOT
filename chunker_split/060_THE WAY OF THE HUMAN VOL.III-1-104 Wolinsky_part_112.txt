ARCHETYPES OF WAVES AND THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC MECHANISM * The I AM is a wave created by supertrings. * The "I AM" is the end product of the Superstrings which are first visible through waves. * God is the invisible force which organizes the universe. Wolinsky: Louise: DEMONSTRATION #2 ELECTROMAGNETICS Define Electromagnetics. It is a coiled, powerful field, constructive or destructive, it is measurable, difficult to deal with it, has polarity and a frequency which changes. * We call it God because we do not know what to call it. ARCHETYPES OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC MECHANISM AND THE COLLECTIVE * The Collective is an electro-magnetic field where "energy" patterns take form and have their own life, i.e., a VOID pattern. 106 Wolinsky:Where do you experience this powerful coil field in your body? Louise:In my chest.
