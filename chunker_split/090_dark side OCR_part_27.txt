Heisenberg, turned the world of physics around when he proved that the observer of the experiment and the experiment were not sepa- rate but in fact, the observer through the act of observation participated and influenced the outcome of the experiment. John Wheeler, another noted physicist changed the word observer to participator, because the act of observation participated in the outcome of the experiment. What does this mean in self-help psychology talk? That you, as the observer of life, participate in how you construct, interpret and experience your internal subjective world. The observer of an experiment participates in the creation of it's outcome through the act of observation. You, as the participator in a workshop on the inner child, create its appearance through the act of observation. What does this mean? By looking for the inner child, you recreate it through the act of "looking." It appears that the wounded inner child was always there, unnoticed. But, according to quantum physics, we create an inner child identity that needs to be healed through the act of "looking."
