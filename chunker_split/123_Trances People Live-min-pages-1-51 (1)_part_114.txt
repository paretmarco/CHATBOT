Understanding that both intra- and interpersonal dynamics ca exist in any individual bridges a longstanding dispute in the field of psychotherapy in which one school seeks to prove that all interaction, are context-dependent (the family therapists), while another pls. sionately asserts that the individual is the only source of lashchange (depth psychotherapists).
