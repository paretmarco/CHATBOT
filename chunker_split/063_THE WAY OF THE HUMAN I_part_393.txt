Recently, I did a demonstration in a workshop with a man who was having marital problems (i.e., not getting what he wanted from his wife). He said, "I accept her." I asked, "When you say accept, what do you feel in your body toward her?" He replied, "I distance myself." Later he realized this was distancing and defending was labeled acceptance which was not acceptance itself which brings about appreciation and more intimacy. In "spiritual" groups, too, I have seen people who claimed detachment, when it was rather cutting-off and defending againt human feelings. What then is the difference between premature detachment and true detachment which is Witnessing and beyond the observer-observed dyad. Premature mature detachment is a defense against separation. Witnessing is beyond the observer-observed dyad, and contains not resistance, defensiveness, judgement, evaluation, or significance. (see Volume III, the NOT I-I). FINAL NOTE Mis-perceived betrayal is the major ingredient in the creation of identities. It is mis-perceived betrayal (i.e., realizing mom is separate from you) which forms what is called in psychoanalytic developmental psychology the "narcissistic injury" (see Volume II).
