If he does what he wants, the result is guilt, if he does what he should (the parental voice), he feels frustrated at not getting what he wants. The key thing to note is that the inner child has fused with "should" voices that actually belong to the parents. Handling the Shoulds Step I:Notice that the should voice is occurring. Step II: Notice where in the body the voice is coming from. Step III: Notice whose voice it is, Mom, Dad, brother, sister, etc. Step IV: Intentionally create the voice several times and experience the voice as energy. Step V: Notice you are the observer observing the voices.. Inner Dialogues can be voices inside, consciously or uncon- sciously, that the inner child repeats to herself, creating problem states. In this case, they fuse the adult in the child trance. These are two sides of the inner child: (1) the child, and (2) the parent, both living inside the adult in present time. A re-enforcement of the inner dialogue occurs within the family.
