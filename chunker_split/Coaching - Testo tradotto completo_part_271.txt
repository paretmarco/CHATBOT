It will allow us to mentally relive that part of our life which has already elapsed, and hand us the suitable elements by which to conduct a critical appraisal of the day that has just gone by. The analysis of the day which is drawing to a close is a kind of accounting exercise that — precisely as it happens in respect of drawing up company balance sheets — has the effect of ideally determining the direction which our future activity is going to take, and highlighting the weak points, the mistakes which have been made, and the liabilities which have been incurred. What is being said here on the subject of critically examining one's day, might — and in fact should with even greater force, be repeated with the weekly, monthly and yearly plans, so as to be able to formulate one's subsequent plans. This critical examination has to be done punctiliously, day after day. Reflecting well over a day that has gone by carries the meaning of reviewing it attentively, always bearing in mind in the process the highest plan, which is the life plan.
