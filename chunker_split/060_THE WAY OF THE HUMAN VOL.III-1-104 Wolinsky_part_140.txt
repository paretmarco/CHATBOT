Those Archetypes which express repressed dissociative spirituality move from conscious or unconscious solidity to the illusion of spirituality, which is even more solidity. In other words when we move from the bottom to the illusion of up going to the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, we are actually moving down and becoming more solid and defensive.' This is why spiritualized people are so rigidified. They appear more spacious when actually they are more rigidified and defended. This explains why people who are more spiritualized have so many rules and regulations and such a rigidified life. 'It should be noted there is no top or bottom. Here we are saying top meaning less solid, thinned-out or pure VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Quantum Psychology is only discussing it in this way as a discussion. Because whether it is solid, thinned-out or more solid, it is still only the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (see Chapter V, the VOID). ________________ Chapter HI Then why we are certain things are so universal? Because there seems to be universal psychological dissociative defenses which become spiritualized False Archetypes. This, of course, is only true if we as the VOID use the lens of Archetypesâ€”NO LENSES NO ARCHETYPES.
