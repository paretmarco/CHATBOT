Ask yourselves daily, after you have correctly defined what you truly want, that is, your genuine objective: “In how many ways can I successfully utilize my resources in order to obtain a higher result, and which should these ways actually be?”. The essential point is that we must strongly will to attain something important; we need to possess the resources to do that; and we should stimulate our unconscious mind for the sake of intuitively understanding how we ought to act. You have to be able to utilize your unconscious. “Learn to create a void, silence, darkness and calm inside your spirit, and then lay in it the seed of a voluntary or intellectual idea, with the specific intention that this seed should develop inside your unconscious side and yield its fruit at the moment you have demarcated beforehand”. Naturally, one cannot reach that result all of a sudden. One will inevitably need long and systematic training sessions, which are in themselves neither difficult nor mysterious. What is required, therefore, consists in getting accustomed to an ever higher level of self-collectedness, and in transforming our will into Prediction, into prayer we would almost be tempted to say.
