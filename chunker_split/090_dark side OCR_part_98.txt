The child had to create a hyper- vigilant trance, watching Dad's every move, because he would space out, forget things, etc. The child within the adult stayed frozen Dis-connect-ion + 59 in time and married a man who was very disconnected and spaced out. This was famil-(iar) to her inner child, whose dark side was attracted to men with whom she had to be hyper-vigilant, as with Dad. As a result, the child within the adult took over, never allowing her a moment' s peace. Notice how her inner child had fused with Dad so the inner child had two sides: a spaced out side and a hyper- vigilant side. It is no wonder she was attracted to a disconnected man. It was familiar. The inner child forced her to shrink her focus of attention and fuse with Dad and allowed her to be over-identified. This created serious anxiety as a child and in her life with her husband, particu- larly as the trance became more and more automatic. In other words, as the observer sleeps, the trance works by itself outside individual conscious control. It becomes an "automatic" trance.
