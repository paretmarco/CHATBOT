SPEAKING FROM OUTSIDE THE SUBJECT'S MICROCOSM - Movement and increasing of the Mandelbaum Effect The eye is lazy and resists the pull of a distant stimulus , preferring to rest at a relatively short focal distance as it does in the dark or when looking at the sky. As the operator will move farther he will move outside this point and his voice will seem to arrive from a different location ENTERING THE SUBJECT MICROCOSM This is done with a fast moving toward the subject. Directing the two eyes on a point demands an expreme convergence of the ocular axes and a strnous accomodation. The proximity of the point being to great, the accomodation, though contracted, is insufficient, in general to allow a clear vision. As for the surroundings objects their images form only the peripheral part of the retina, since the central part is focused. The peripherical sensations on the retina are weaker than the sensations at the centre. In these conditions the subject makes himself almost blind to the external world and the more we are near, the more the process is accentuated.
