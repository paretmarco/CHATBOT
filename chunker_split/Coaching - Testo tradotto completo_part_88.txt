It is further incumbent on us to know that, though the intestine only hosts one tenth of the brain’s neurons, it nevertheless operates in an autonomous fashion, helps the entrenchment of the memories that are linked to emotions, and fulfils an essential role in signalling joy and pain. The intestine, in short, is the seat of a second brain. In the belly, we also come across some autonomous neuronal tissue. It is no coincidence that the intestine cells produce 95% of serotonin, which is the neurotransmitter of wellbeing 24. The intestine releases serotonin as a result of external stimuli, such as food being caused to enter it, but also as a result of sounds or colours, or as a by-product of precisely the “step-based” methodology. Finally, for the sake of relaxation, you might also embark on more comprehensive “steps”. Such “steps” are carried out by bringing your hands to the level of the forehead, by opening them and by slowly letting them slide down the body, their palms facing the body, while you give attention to the sensations which correspond to the different areas.
