It is thus that we find two times existing side by side: A time of becoming, where we outwardly express ourselves in one particular direction, and an absolute time, being a time in which every day is lived for what it truly is, extracting maximum pleasure from it. In this latter time, we might happen to come across new opportunities which empower us to proceed along progressively larger dimensions. The discovery, as one moves on (chronos), of novel opportunities (vertical lines - kairos), allows us to find increasingly greater outlets of external self-expression Temporal sequences â€“ The time of the self and the time of becoming The time of the instant and the short span of time must be felt as something complete in itself. Conversely, the time of becoming is structured in a sequence of events. We are not, in other words, merely aware of the now, because, as we think of a particular moment, we join together a series of events, in particular an imaginary future as well as a past which is recollected in our memory 51. The length of such sequences is essential for the purpose of the action which is subsequently opted for.
