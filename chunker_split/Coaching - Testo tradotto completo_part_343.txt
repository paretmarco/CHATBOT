You must say to your own selves that you want, and are both able and determined to apply the methodology for the sake of your self-improvement 77. Basic exercise This exercise can be carried out in one of two possible ways: Either in front of a mirror, or through a light relaxation and on the strength of a calm breathing, the eyes closed, while you visualize the present which you desire to see actualized. The first way is, however, the most effective, simple and fast 78. Looking at yourselves in the mirror is as if you were conversing with a friend, and you succeed in persuading him. Take it easy, exit the time of urgency, and be in the time of the present, in some “beginning”. Alternate the use of the pronoun “I” and the pronoun “you”. As you keep on watching yourselves, you are going to say to yourselves now and end “you can do”, while on other occasions you are going to utter to yourselves, “yes, I can do”. Be colourful in your expressions, and describe the state which can be reached in a clear manner.
