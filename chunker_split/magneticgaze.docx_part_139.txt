More recently, we have personally been able to notice how Jerry Kein, an American hypnotist, used to repeatedly touch that point so as to facilitate the inducement of a hypnotic state. Various French hypnotists and magnetizers at the start of the 20th century (cf. Moutin, “Le Magnétisme Humain”) make mention of this point as an important one to press in order to “let go of the personality” and thereby ease the fostering of a hypnotic condition. [20] Cf. Esarah Maimeroth, 49. [21] Cf. Rupert Sheldrake, “The sense of being stared at”. This book also quotes many interesting experiments where people react to a look even when they are stared at from behind.
