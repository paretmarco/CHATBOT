Because each dimension, i.e., thinking, body-work, etc., uses different (although interconnected) parts of the brain as in holistic medicine. If the liver is not used or orchestrated well with the digestive tract, then the stomach must work harder. The results may be that your food will not be metabolized as well. In the same way, if your cortex (thinking center) is overused, your sense of the body will be underused (to be be discussed later). To illustrate further, let us take the example of incest survivors. Incest survivors can receive psychotherapy and yet, when their 122 Chapter VIII bodies go into the same or a similar position as when they were molested, their psychological issues come back again. Why? Because the body and psyche are holographic; that is, they have different functions but yet are totally interconnected and not separable. For this reason, the "unprocessed" body memory forces the psychological fears around the molestation to re-emerge.
