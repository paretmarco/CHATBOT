It is extremely hard for the human mind to formulate the admission that “I am in the wrong”, especially if he has involved in the process such emotions are self-pride and dignity. When that fails to occur, we are unwilling to acknowledge the fact that the operation as carried out is mistaken and that it is turning against our expectations. Yet the reality is that, in the financial markets, it often happens that the same conduct sometimes leads to satisfaction (gains) while at other times it occasions hardships (losses). People do not like to accept discomfort, because they always want to be right. Accordingly, they cannot welcome error by accepting it. If hardships keep on manifesting, at an escalating level (= losing money further), such individuals will insist unperturbed in using the same modus operandi, in fact to an even greater extent (= they will increase the risk), and they will think: “That stock, no doubt, is ripe to bounce back, it has by now reached the bottom of its value, and cannot just precipitate further (or soar to even greater heights, as the case may be)”.
