PART FIVE: PERSON TYPES Obviously, the more we delve into the communication argument, the more we learn about the different methods available for understanding what psychological type we have in front of us. Very useful in this procedure is the ENNEAGRAM. The enneagram in some schools of thought is seen as a tool for spiritual growth, in others, it is seen under a psychological profile. We follow a third idea; unlike the traditional methods, our emphasis falls on communication. For this reason we refer to the “Communicational Enneagram”. ENNEAGRAM “Enneagrams are the geometry of the soul, which reveal our character” (Helen Palmer) Have you ever wanted to know what your interlocutor thinks about? The enneagram is a specific description, concise and precise, of nine personality profiles in which we can all recognize ourselves. It is an excellent tool to help us understand ourselves in a deeper way, to improve our understanding of others, to highlight positive sides in ourselves and in others, to soften negative ones, and to be able to comprehend similarity and dislikes. Apart from this description, the enneagram also identifies personal growth for us: to improve ourselves, develop thoughts, emotions, and unexpressed potentiality. The enneagram originated as a tool in the East, becoming widespread in the West later. The name comes from the Greek word ennea, which means nine and gramma which stands for sign.
