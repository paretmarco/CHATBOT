First Mlles pseudo-orientation in time as she imagines a catastrophic outcome occurring in the future and therefore experiences fear_ Next she uses posthypnotic suggestions ("it will never work out," "I can't cope with life," "Nothing will help") to articulate and differentiate the particulars of the negative outcome she is imagining. These are reinforced by negative hallucinations, which block her ability to see or acknowledge other resources, and perhaps vivified by positive hallucinations as she visualizes herself encountering an anxiety- provoking stimulus (such as a bill collector) that is not present in present time. All of this turmoil is likely to be further exacerbated by an experience of time distortion in which she has a breathless feeling that there is not enough time to find any kind of solution. Erickson (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979) wrote about the "common everyday trance" that naturally occurs throughout the day. This is the type of light trance state that we all experience periodically. It is not particularly problematic and, indeed, it can even be refreshing.
