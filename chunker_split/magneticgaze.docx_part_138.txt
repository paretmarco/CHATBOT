[16] In terms of an ancient Egyptian legend, the sun and the moon were the eyes of a large divinity, Hor-jerti, i.e. “Horus of the two eyes”. This pair of eyes is similarly linked to two snakes as part of a tradition reminiscent of the Indian tradition which is part of kundalini, and in accordance with which ida and pingala are the names of the two lateral channels around the sushunna. This tradition about the two lateral parts of the body sill goes on even in the fascination school of Virgilio T., as it confers special importance on the two hemispheres. [17] Cf. Lefebure, “Initiatic Techniques”. [18] An illustrating example of that is the eye depicted even on US dollars. The eye as represented in it, moreover, is placed in such a manner as to form the summit of a pyramid, almost as if to complete it and symbolically allude thereby at the fact that the building is incomplete without such a superior vision. [19] In an even more ancient epoch, Abbot Faria used to inter alia resort to touching that area as a hypnogenous method.
