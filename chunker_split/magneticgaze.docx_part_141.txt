In several German and Hungarian traditions, it is believed that children below the age of 1 year should abstain from looking at themselves in a mirror (Cf. Seligmann, p. 285). [23] The exercise might even be carried out by affixing the small piece of cardboard onto the wall. The purpose of this exercise is to develop lateral vision, as that makes one’s look even stronger. [24] The present exercise might additionally be done together with the “close-far” exercise which is going to be described a bit later. [25] Refer, for instance, to Bandler, Dilts, Grinde, “Programmazione Neurolinguistica”, edited by Astrolabio, or else to the EMDR technique followed by Shapiro. Many problems are solved by means of ocular movements. Dr. Lefebure, too, makes mention of an exercise based on motioning the head, which is aimed at more thoroughly activitating one’s cerebral faculties. Cf. “L’initation de Pietro”. [26] As we have remarked in a previous footnote, Tommaso Campanella used to take notice of how the impact by the eyes manifested more easily in wonderment and love for a person or a thing.
