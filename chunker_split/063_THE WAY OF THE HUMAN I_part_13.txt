Stephen Wolinsky The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness For this reason, "Quantum Psychology" as well as the "me," the "you", "this book," "your last thought," is an event (i.e., a coming together or a moving apart of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. ).2 I AM NOT ME "Nothingness is the building block of the Universe." John Wheeler The "I" is not a "me," the "I" cannot be a specific something because this "I" is a condensation and solidification of the EMPTINESS or NOTHINGNESS which is continually condensing and thinning out, while never losing its nature as the EMPTINESS or UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. For this reason (as will be discussed later), the "I" I think I am is very temporary, arising and subsiding in and as that ONE SUBSTANCE only to re-appear again "later" while the nervous system records and acts "as if' it were always there in time and had never left (see Volume III, Appendix: Vishnu's Demon).
