You must learn how to create some vacuum inside your spirit by “sweeping up” all thoughts, irritants, and plans. Chances to relax one’s spirit spontaneously arise every day, and they might even be deliberately set up. When you go to your office or come back from it, as you are waiting for a person, during a meal, in the course of work itself, there are always opportunities to relax. Psycho-physical relaxation and the technique of the light are powerful tools in this connection. The body and the mind that work incessantly cannot but work badly. The mind, exactly like a race horse, must be trained to carry out gradually more strenuous efforts, subject to the proviso that such efforts should be interspersed by periods of complete rest. That way, the brain will increase its performance step by step, precisely as the horse learns to progressively increase its speed. The following point thus ensues: We must reflect with all our energies on the issues which are in need of attention, but we must also fully and unconditionally rest as soon as our vision begins to get blurred. This alternation of effort and relaxation represents the secret behind creative work.
