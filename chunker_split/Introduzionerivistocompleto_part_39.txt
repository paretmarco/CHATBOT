For example, to understand how efficient SELF-HYPNOSIS can be, just think that it has been established that the most famous geniuses in history, like Einstein, Edison… etc, owe their discoveries to their ability to put themselves, unknowingly, in a state of SELF-HYPNOSIS, using the inexhaustible possibilities of the subconscious, considered the stem of discovery, invention and success. SELF-HYPNOSIS allows you to focus your attention on what you desire, for example to be calm, serene, concentrated, and attent, with the mind empty or totally occupied in an activity chosen by us. All this happens in a condition of absolute freedom from external influences and insignificant thoughts. With this method, we can face exams with security, develop or abandon certain habits… etc.
