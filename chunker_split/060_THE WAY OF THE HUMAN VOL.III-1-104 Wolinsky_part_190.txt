Just for fun, notice that there is no me, and decide that the me is me and the EMPTINESS is NOT-ME. Paula:Okay. Wolinsky:Now, stop believing that and realize that that EMPTINESS is me and the me is not me. Paula:(no response) Wolinsky:No words? Paula:I can say but it won't really say it. Therapeutic Note She let go of the concept of "me" by first differentiating and then switching the Not-"me"-"me". You have ideas about "me", "me" being your "me". So you are bringing into awareness and dismantling the ideas you have about "me" and what happens is this opens up the No-State-state of I AM and the NOT-I-I. What happened was that at "some point" EMPTINESS condensed down and created a concept of "me" and itself (VOID) as Not-"me." So all we are doing is reversing the process so you get that the EMPTINESS is "me" and this is not "me".
