Just as, — in order to make things clearer to ourselves —, it is possible to make the forearm contract irresistibly upon one's arm simply through a process of self-suggestion to the effect that “that must necessarily be accomplished”, it will also be possible, and with even greater force, to behave to our advantage in a given situation. It is nevertheless necessary to observe that, exactly in the same way that even a slightest initial motion of a “voluntary” character does facilitate the self-persuasive, automatic contraction of the forearm upon one's arm, even a most negligible “voluntary” initiative will be of extraordinary benefit to the accomplishment of the desired result. I – let us assume — predict for this afternoon the need to betake to a certain person who instils fear in me: It is necessary for me to go and meet him at his place, inasmuch as he is the only one who can benefit my attempt to realize my purpose. It is something clear and unchallengeable that the prior visualization of the conversation with such a person, which is achieved through fantasy, concentration, and spiritual prayer, will confer near-mathematical certainty on the success of my undertaking.
