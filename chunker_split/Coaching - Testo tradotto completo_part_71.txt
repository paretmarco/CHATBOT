The big enemy of this method is habit, that is, passive ideation, the door thrown wide open through which the whole procession of hackneyed ideas, uncontrolled opinions, futile statements, and useless wandering in which most of our days are lost, enter. Be original! This is the one fundamental rule. In order to succeed in being original, the following conditions are indispensable: 1. Eliminating whatever is of no avail, the habits which consume your mental energy and cause you to forever tread the same path out of fear of any new road; 2. Centralizing yourselves, connecting yourselves with that which represents the true essential being, and as such the fountainhead of every potentiality; 3. Once that stage is reached, venturing into new situations, new thoughts, and new actions. That is unfailingly attained provided you refuse to submit to the mindâ€™s automatic impulses, and provided you unfalteringly aspire to progress. If we have to go to a specific place, let us reach it by travelling on a different road.
