In 1873, when Donato was initiated in mesmerism by the Canon Mouls de Bordeaux, the question had for a long time been abandoned on account of the condemnation pronounced by the scientific societies and particularly by the Academy of Medicine of Paris, which in 1842 had solemnly declared that the whole thing was only a tissue of frauds and impostures. Hardly would a doctor admit the possibility of even inducing sleep. This state of things is explained by the imperfections of the processes used in the work up to that time. They were slow, laborious and not efficacious, easily discouraging the efforts of the magnetizers and facilitating the incredulity of their adversaries. In the same year Donato had the happiness of soon making a discovery which in a measure put him in the way of convincing the world not only of the reality of somnambulism, but also and above all of other phenomena much more astonishing. Donato was quick, ardent, and impetuous to excess. It is to these natural defects that he owes his discovery. Under the dominion of a feverish impatience he made his first experiments. As he said: â€œMinutes seemed to me centuries.
