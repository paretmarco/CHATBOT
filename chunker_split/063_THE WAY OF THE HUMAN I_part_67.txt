If only I were enough, had enough experience, then it wouldn't have happened." Another False Core might feel powerless. Oftentimes, the "I am powerless" False Cores have a resistance to being powerless, so they oftentimes act overly powerful. They might say, "Actually I wasn't molested; what happened is I seduced Uncle Henry into molesting me." Another False Core might say "See, I knew there was no love in the world." TRYING TO HEAL THE FALSE CORE There are many different ways to attempt to heal the narcissistic wound. Unfortunately, many False Selfs do not try to heal the wound by feeling what is there. Rather they try to heal or overcome the reason for the shockâ€”which is not the shock itself. However, the approach each False Self Compensator takes to heal is more false than the False Core itself. No matter how much the person tries to compensate (for "I cannot do") or to be perfect ("There must be something wrong with me") deep down they know it's merely a cover or Compensator for the False Core.
