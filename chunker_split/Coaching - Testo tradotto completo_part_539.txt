Coordinating one’s will = Substituting intended mental representations for the impulsive type thereof Will = Coordinating one’s ideas Educating one’s will does not bear any other connotation than training ourselves on how to gradually replace impulsive and dispersive actions with the ideo-determined type which are harmoniously in line with the Universe. Opportunities Having a plan, therefore, is paradoxically of helpful assistance to the effort of being in the now, and being in time as opposed to see it passing by.

It is only in this way that we might fully exploit the power of the mind, have the chance of discovering the opportunities provided by life, and enjoy them to their fullest.
