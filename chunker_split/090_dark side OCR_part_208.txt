Interestingly, very often the mother teaches and is the model for repressing ones personal power. An example in recent years is the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). This amendment guarantees equal rights to women. What is astonishing is that the little girl inside the adult woman has been so trained to hide her power and has pretended so long that she is less than a man, that she has forgotten she is pretending. Thus, many conservative women demonstrate their age regression by being against their own equal rights ! Adult Problem States: The next major problem arises when disappointments come from the spouse not matching the idealizations. In this style, the child within the man tries to make his spouse into an ideal. Frustration escalates since nobody can equal someone else's internal ideal. This idealization trance also prevents the man from dealing with his reality and relationship now. In these situations there are two trances which occur. 1. The child idealizes Mom and Dad to survive. 2. The child within the adult generalizes this strategy to his spouse, illusioning them to be something they are not, to continue the childhood trance.
