The salesman who is forever travelling in no way relishes the pleasure of moving to a new place which is instead the lot falling to a student on holiday; the son of the confectioner never eats sweets. The history of people who are addicted to toxic substances, such as smokers, consumers of morphine, and alcoholics, teaches us that sensations, in order to be recharged, require increasingly bigger doses. We can notice the following: When we consider the average human being, what represents for him the culmination of pleasure? It is the very moment when he achieves possession, nay, if it were legitimate to put it that way â€” the first such moment. Immediately thereafter, the descending curve begins. Why is that so? It is once again due to the same underlying reason: The fact that the tension stops. The pleasure of the tension subsists in the modification undergone by the body. The experts in physiology will say, through a more fastidiously specific description: Increased cardiac activity, stronger pulse, plenitude of the blood vessels, accelerated breathing, and so on and so forth.
