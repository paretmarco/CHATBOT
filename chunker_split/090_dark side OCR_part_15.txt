It' s an old movie that you re-run again and again causing the old feelings and experiences to be felt over and over. In my work, rather than empowering an inner child or memory, we empower you, the one who observes and holds the memory in place. According to Albert Ellis, "It is your must that the memory must not have existed that is given the real power, not the picture itself' (Ellis, personal letter). Here, I would say it is the observer who holds the memory in place by resisting the memory. Ellis thinks, however, that the primary glue that holds the memory in place is the must not have occurred thought. In the process presented here, you learn to identify what the inner child is doing so hte observer can awaken and stop identifying with those old trances. This enables you to begin to identify with the observer you that is free of trances. This frees you from the wounded inner child that is stuck, so you can live fully in present time. This book is about going beyond the trances, outdated strategies and belief structures created in childhood to cope with the chaos of life.
