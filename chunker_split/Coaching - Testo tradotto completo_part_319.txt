This does not mean that, in order for one to attain such a state of “acting naturally”, it might not at times be necessary to carry out a “super effort” capable of sweeping away the “self” and its limitations. The exercises set out in the first part of this book aim precisely at accomplishing that goal. The quality of “acting naturally” is founded on the concept of “being present to one's own self”. One has to act with his essential inward being rather than with his egotistic self. Being present denotes being one's own master, having the capacity to distinguish between those actions demanding a logical and rational effort from the type of action which, by contrast, is a response to the automatic character of life.
