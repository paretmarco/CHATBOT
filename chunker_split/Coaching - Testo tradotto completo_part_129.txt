From a technical point of view, what happens in such an instance is that we fall into a “trance”, that is, into an automatic mode of reacting. Another such example is provided by a woman who promises herself not to indulge in excessive consumption of food any longer. A short while after formulating that promise to herself, she walks past a confectionery, goes in, and buys a chocolate sweet which she proceeds to partake of at once. Technically speaking, this woman has suffered 1. Amnesia of the promise she had made to herself; 2. Regression to some moment in her childhood when the chocolate sweet was for her the source of great satisfaction. In other words, this woman has lived in a trance without being “present to her self”. Hypnotherapy might offer some benefit in cases such as hers, but it remains no more than a partial remedy: We must rather learn how to be outside trances in each and every moment of our life without any external aid. This is precisely what the technique of the “presence” helps us develop. The key to be concrete lies in maintaining a direct sensory reference.
