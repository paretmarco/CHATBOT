Knowing how to watch oneself acting It is necessary, if one wishes to fully harmonize the single actions in a single interrelated whole, to ensure that all the distinct actions should let themselves be subsumed under an action which is always “straight”, in the sense of being directed towards a purpose. In essence, that requires man to be his own master, to be capable, that is, of selecting one specific direction and then “watching his own self acting in a natural way”. The outward attitude of the true achiever in life, the one who extracts from it a full cup of gratifying self-fulfilment, is not, contrary to the way many people imagine, the attitude of a madly possessed fellow who in his frenzy throws half of the world upside down. It is rather the attitude of a calm man who is open to the world, forever the same, without either arrogance or humility, and who simply does. His sight is straight and confident, he speaks slowly, and as he does so, his full-toned voice says, if need be, “I do not know” and “I apologize”. He has a very correct yet unhurried appearance.
