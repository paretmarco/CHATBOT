Noted family therapist Carl Whitaker once gave a workshop to about 300 therapists at which he said, "You are all prostitutes." The therapists got angry and asked him why. "Because you act unconditionally loving and supportive for a price," he said. "When your client doesn't pay his bill, you are no longer unconditionally lovingâ€”you get pissed off." Definitions of the trance of counter-trance-ference generally put the pnus on the client or patient. In other words, the implicit message is that the therapist or teacher is reacting to their client's or student's trance-ference. This eliminates the possibility that the therapist or teacher is in a parental and counter-trance-ference identity first, and at some level is asking the client/student to play their game and not question. 226 Special Section Some teachers I have worked with are in their teacher identity, and are in a constant state of trance-ference/counter-trance-ference with their clients and students. In this way they are in a characterological or integrated trance-ference. I call this characterological when therapists or teachers adapt a system which supports, reinforces and exalts counter-tranceference, i.e., being the unconditionally loving mommy or daddy. I define characterological as having little or no awareness of your process.
