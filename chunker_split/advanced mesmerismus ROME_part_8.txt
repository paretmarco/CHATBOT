How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected.
