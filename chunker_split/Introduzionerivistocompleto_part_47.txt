Often, we hear phrases like, “With all this stress and anxiety for the things I’ve got to finish, I’ll get an ulcer!” We try to resolve our problems but are swamped by them. The answer distances itself and we remain trapped in a situation of malaise, and then we somatically try to face them. Dumping our tensions on the somatic tract and, over time, one of our organs can lead us to the point of becoming ill (target organ). An accumulation of particularly stressful events, and above all, the inability of the individual to manage the resulting emotions in an adequate way, can make the individual more susceptible to illness. As NLP also confirms, it is not the events in themselves that bring on psychosomatic illness or anxiety, but the way in which we live them and react to them. Before going ahead with the various techniques, it is advisable to highlight the importance of the psychophysical condition at our disposal and in this sense, relaxation techniques offer a great contribution. We also need to have trust the power of our minds and the fact that, as happens when using NLP techniques, it can be “reprogrammed”, substituting negative learning with positive, in such as way that the experience gained is prolonged in the future. Thoughts need to be used to feed us and not to block us anymore. The key to obtaining the results we want consists of placing of ourselves in a positive state of mind, with the awareness that we can govern our life.
