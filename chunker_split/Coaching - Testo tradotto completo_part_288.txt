Do in every moment the best thing you can do. You ought in each and every moment to do, invariably and prior to any thing else, what might not be done at a different moment. Which of the necessary undertakings best suits this exact moment? II. Understand the “type of activity”. There are some activities which wear out one part of the brain more than others, while a different set of activities has the effect of tiring another part of the brain more. An illustrating example might consist in studying or doing some accounting and keeping ties with other human beings (phone calls, etc). If you alternate these activities, which is actually the method you should adopt, you will always enjoy the maximum level of efficiency. III. Being conscious of time. The watch might dictate the way work is going to be done. If you foresee yourselves having a certain amount of time at your disposal, you should immediately choose to give preference to the work which fits the available time best, the way a certain shoe fits one's feet the most.
