In Chapter 14 of The Dark Side of the Inner Child: The Next Step, I refer to transpersonal transference, a process whereby the child transfers unresolved developmental relationship with their parents onto God, a guru, a path, a system or a technique. For example, a child learns how to win grace or if they are bad, falling from Mom and Dad's grace. The transpersonal transference can be traced directly to this child-parent relationship which is then trance-ferred onto a God, with rigid standards and rules. This can be seen as a way of understanding people's experience of a loving or, contrarily, a wrathful God. But this is not a true Archetype (from the top down; VOID-+ARCHETYPE). These are Archetypical developmental distortions which move from the bottom up (Conscious/ unconscious--►yielding a great solidity and a False Archetype and False spirituality). A true Archetype is a primal universal pattern which occurs through a direct contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTI. ATED CONSCIOUSNESS and comes directly from a contraction 137 The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum Psychology of the Pysics Dimensions and Forces. It is that which makes what "you" call you "you."
