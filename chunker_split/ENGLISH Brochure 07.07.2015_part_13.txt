Note for Peter: Erminio practiced all types of techniques: his instant healing, but he did also magnetic healings (though very fast) and spoken hypnotism, but always using the gaze and the idea of energy. He wrote therefore a book with the title “Practical Hypno-magnetism” (Ipnomagnetismo Pratico). Erminio experimented also on the so called “higher phenomena” of magnetism. Again luck played a part in what was to happen in the future. Paret soon became a friend of Emernio’s and it was with his help he was able to set establish his first hypnotic practice. To many people what Erminio achieved may sound incredible, but his method worked, and when he died in 2002 it was estimated he had hypnotised and treated some 250,000 people. While investigation into mesmerism was exciting to Marco and Max, the whole question of hypnotism in Italy was rather sterile. A few doctors and psychologists used the typical hypnotism approach with moderate success, although a large number of people who had been practicing magnetic cures that after World War 2 renamed their method, calling it ‘Pranotherapy’, which was and is an energy laying on of hands similar to ‘Therapeutic Touch’. But then ‘Neuro-Linguistic Programming’ (NLP), a system developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, burst upon the psychotherapeutic horizon promising to ‘help people have better, fuller and richer lives’, (Bandler, R. and Grinder, J. The Structure of Magic. Volume 2. 1975. Science & Behavior Books. Palo Alto, CA.)
