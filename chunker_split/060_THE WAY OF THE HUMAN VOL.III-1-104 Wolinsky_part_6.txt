It should also be noted that Gautma the Buddha's realization led him to and beyond the Hindu Yoga experience of transmigration, (a separate individual soul or atma) which incarnates again and again. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology To best explain this, it can be said that ESSENCE carries with it a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, and with that condensation. the "characteristics" of that particular "piece" of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS with its memories and consciousnesses, etc. We might "think" or imagine that an "individual" soul exists at the level of ESSENCE, but to go beyond we must realize that at the level of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, there is no "individual soul" only the BIG EMPTINESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. To illustrate, imagine ice cubes placed in a bathatub as made of the same substance as the water in the tub. In the same way, water (EMPTINESS) in a bath tub could become solid (ice) and thin-out to become water in different areas within the tub.
