In Quantum Psychology this means that when biological "have to's are not met, the substituted biological need becomes an aberrant psychological want (obsessive-compulsive desire) and, hence, is exaggerated and distorted. If this occurs, you chase an image of gratification (achievement) which is different from the biological need in an attempt to satisfy the merger response. In this example, wanting to have others say you are great could be an attempt to get the biological need of merging met. This yields no satisfaction because the real biological need has not been met. This substituting of dimensions (external and thinking in this case) for another (biological) yields pain. The need which is natural and biological must be met first. This is why, when the Zen master was asked, "What is enlightenment?" he replied, "When you are hungry, you eat. When you are tired, you sleep." (There is no longer any issue or internal considering about it.) QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You must meet the biological at the biological level. And do not substitute one biological need for another biological need (i.e., food for merger).
