This means that the therapist is thus working with the actual ingredients (psychobiological states) of the problem, rather than with its rarefied, cognitive version. The means by which a therapeutic outcome is evoked from a symptomatic state comes through the narrowing and fixating of attention, which eventually triggers a spontaneous expansion of attention. A phobia, as it is experienced chronically by a person, requires an intensely shrunken focus of attention. I would treat the phobia by intensifying that experience of narrowed focus and thereby lead the patient into an expanded state of comfort, relaxation, and deep change (therapeutic trance). The symptom itself is used to create a more therapeutic natural state. It is paradoxical. Intensifying the dynamic that creates the symptornatology actually helps the person move out of it into an expanded state. In other words, the more you shrink your focus of attention in therapeutic trance, the more your perspective spontane- ously expands (a no-trance state, in my terms). Gilligan has noted the paradoxical nature of trance (1987): 44 â€¢ Trancis ritlel L Ives a paradox.. .is, a ;cal both/and logic.
