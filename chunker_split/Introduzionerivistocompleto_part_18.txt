It is the natural way of expressing our state of mind and it can bring us into direct contact with our deepest emotions: fear, anxiety and joy, which are directly transmitted by our hands, legs and facial muscles. Our mind can decide whether or not to express verbally these sensations or emotions, but we are aware that it is sometimes better to keep quiet. For example, we can say that we are not annoyed but a small, involuntary gesture by our body can give away what we are saying, though normally, nobody pays attention. There are various ways of classifying different states of mind and, for practical purposes, it is useful to focalize on some in particular in order to understand our communication with another individual, whatever the relationship may be. These are: 1. ATTENTION 2. INTEREST 3. PLEASURE 4. REFLECTIVENESS What are the gestures that accompany each of these states? Pleasure, for example, is perceived by way of specific gestures. Remember that CNV is sensorially demonstrated and it is so inherent in man that it can’t be conditioned in anyway. SOME NON-VERBAL SIGNS The attention that a person shows during listening to someone else is shown by the body posture. For example, leaning the chest forward is a sign of attention. Pleasure is connected to the lips and to the so-called analogical kisses. Biting the lips means: “I would like to but I can’t” The tongue is an indicator of strong pleasure towards the person, the subject being discussed, or the situation.
