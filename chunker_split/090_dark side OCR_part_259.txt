At one point, they were probably getting married; then it didn't happen. He said to me, "I'm afraid she is going to leave me. I have extreme anxiety." Anxiety is "futurizing". He was catastrophizing that she was going to leave him. From his history of women leaving him, he was already forecasting the future. He felt incredible anxiety and pain. He was in the inner-child Appendix I 416 161 identity, replaying the movies of past abandonments and creating, through his own inner dialogue and futurizing, "She is going to leave me." What I wanted to know was how this man got into a rejection trance with this woman, creating the experience called, "She's going to leave me." The inner child hypnotized him, but it was triggered by her. In my own case, when I am driving down the street and I see a police car in front of me, I tighten my muscles and take a deep breath or stop my breath. From the trigger the policeman I create a catastrophizing trance. I am already imagining a catastrophic thing, he'll pull me over and give me a ticket.
