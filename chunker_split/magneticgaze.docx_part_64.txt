The unconscious, indeed, always works for the person’s wellbeing and in his interest. We are not dealing here with some mere hypnotic suggestion, so much so that on some occasions (albeit rarely) it is necessary to operate two or three times before “the right moment can be grabbed”. If it had been no more than a suggestion, the third attempt would be bound to emulate what happened to the previous ones. As that is not the case, however, it means we have actually guided our patient to a new life dimension. 6. Our further studies Our own Nice-based school has scientifically examined the phenomenon. A key aspect of the look-centred therapy is letting ourselves be observed and observing in turn the patient while we give him a chance to recollect the state that caused him problems. Thereupon, we shall lead the person into a state of fascination without any recourse to words. Such method, indeed, allows us to transport him into a state of “non-thinking” where the symptom disappears. It is the equivalent of resetting the mind.
