Think of the water you are drinking as having been enlivened via a descent and a gradual materialization of the spirit in the world, which is caused by the spirit assuming the shape of that perfection you have imagined to perceive on the surface of the water. Hold the cup which contains the liquid and drink it slowly, non-stop, accompanying such action by the idea that the vibrations cast into it by your thought shall all bounce back to you, for them to subsequently circulate within your being. In order to asseverate the successful execution of the operation, you ought to feel yourselves, at the end of it, being in a state of happy calm, as if the discharge of the vow expressed by yourselves through the formula had already taken place at that precise moment. Our advice to the disciple is to study this paragraph well, and to assess every part thereof as it should. Success depends on its precise implementation, not only the material side of it, but also the spiritual component of its application. The level you have attained by this stage, provided you have worked well, is already the level attained through an average self-hypnosis.
