Once re-enforced by Mom, situations that appear similar to the child Con-fusion â€¢ 95 create con-fusion and the inner child creates the same reaction (trance or identity) that worked before with Mom. Simply put a child who eats with his hands receives a not okay look from Mom. If the observer cannot integrate the mother's message, confusion is created. In that shift of awareness from observing Mom and her message to creating a reaction that gets Mom's approval, coping devices emerge which can be called identities. In this situation one particular identity that might mani- fest is "I want to do it my way." With further intensification of the message by the mother, the observer again produces confusion and might create another identity called "Yes Mom, whatever you want." To make it even more interesting, the observer places the entire situation on automatic, goes to sleep and, thus, the inner child window to reality is born. He can now avoid thinking about new reactions in present time and can just keep creating the same old identity that worked with Mom. These two identities are now in opposition to one another.
