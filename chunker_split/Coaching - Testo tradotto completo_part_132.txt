Exercise 22 – Reviewing life Let us cast a look back at our life, but this time as if inverted. Let us become conscious of the fact that choices we had deemed obligatory are in reality choices which were based more on fear and the desire to survive than on a goal to be attained. Exercise 23 – The mirror Let us face a mirror, and merely look at ourselves. Let us see us the way we are, by keeping presence to our body as long as possible. Thereafter, let us lower the eyes. If any thought or idea descends on us, let us lift our eyes and send such thought or idea back to the image in the mirror. We should maintain an extreme degree of self-presencing throughout. Let us further realize that what we are facing ahead of is no more than a projection 37 . The truth is that many things which are deemed indispensable, and for the sake of which one struggles hard, or which are either coveted or cause us to feel regretful for lacking or losing them, are indeed superfluities.
