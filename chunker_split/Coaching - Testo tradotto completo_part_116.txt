In case some extraneous thought interposes itself, chase it away through a brief deliberate effort, and then go back to perceiving the black ... something black ... think of nothing other than the black. To recapitulate, the procedure unfolds itself through three different stages: 1. Secluding oneself 2. Relaxing 3. Halting one’s cerebral work or, to put it better, breaking up every conscious cerebral undertaking. Total zero-ideation is something rare. So long as the mind is awake, its mechanism is in fact usually orientated in one or two ways: It is either directed at a fixed idea, or else it jumps from one idea to another in accordance with laws of association. What is important to do is to shatter logical thought, that is, the representation which images arouse in us. To take an example, “seeing something black” and nothing other than the black is not an easy task, and it is not necessary after all. One person might find it easier to actualize a different mono-ideation, e.g. the idea of a flowing river, of a rope which goes on ad infinitum and which our thought ensures it will unceasingly roll out, and so on.
