But whether it is condensed or thinned out, it is still the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which is UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and does not know itself)Â° Thus, the Zen Patriarch said, "The Great Way is easy, except for those who have preferences?' Noted Physicist, John Wheeler, said it this way, "Nothingness is the building block of the universe." To illustrate, if you put ice cubes in a bathtub, they are like condensed VOID but when they liquify and turn into water again, this is like thinned out VOID (water). Nevertheless, they are still both made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. There is no individual separate soul which incarnates again and again and again. There is only one soul, and your soul and my soul are the same soul. If you substitute the word "soul" for SUBSTANCE, then there is only ONE SUBSTANCE (SOUL), not two or more individual souls or substances. Pure spirituality lies in understanding that there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and that everything is made of it. Quantum Physics has demonstrated that everything is connected to everything else. Behind all the apparent differences, there exists a unified field of interconnected wholeness.
