Eyebrows lifted up very much and spread out, pupils tracing a normal line. The sketch which is provided hereunder emphasizes some of the essential aspects in a different variant which we might define as “flabbergasted”. Proud look. Eyebrows raised upwardly, pupils turned up in a slightly angular shape. Protective look. Eyebrows slightly turned up, look cascading from on top. Contemplative look. Eyebrows set in an upward position, pupils turned upwardly. Desirous look. Eyebrows forming a normal line, drawn slightly together, pupils turned upwardly. Voluptuous look. Eyebrows following a normal line, slightly drawn together, pupils turned upwardly. Imperious look. Eyebrows tracing a slightly arched line, angular look lifted upwardly. Dejected look. Eyebrows shaping a normal line, straight pupils slightly turned upwardly. Japanese people bestow a special attention on this type of look, by virtue of which it is possible to notice the white part of the eye both laterally and from underneath. They call it sanpaku, a term which might be literally translated as “three (san) whites (paku)”. This look accordingly evidences an imbalance.
