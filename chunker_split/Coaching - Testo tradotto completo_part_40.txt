A sufficiently extolled reason will always stir will into action, and yet such will is exposed to the risk of bending down a short while later, in the event that there is a deficient degree of the energy which is a sine qua non of psychological activity, namely, one’s nervous strength 4. Neuric strength, in fact, is man’s “vitality”. A healthy man, the one who develops himself in a balanced fashion, naturally possesses a certain amount thereof. As for the human being who is the victim of worries or is blocked by emotions or by his mental side, he causes such neuric force to get dispersed. Specific exercises are, however, capable of retrieving it as well as strengthening it. Accumulation, preservation and distribution of energy are thus comparable to a problem relating to financial addition and subtraction 5. Every financial problem has indeed two components to it: How to avoid losses, and how to maximize profits.
