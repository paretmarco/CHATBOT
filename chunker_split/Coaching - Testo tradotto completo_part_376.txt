If, upon surveying the history of past epochs, we were to search for the reasons behind the success achieved by famous men from every age or nation, we would quickly reach the realization that this success always resulted from their ability to magnetically "fascinate" their addressees. Plutarch, for example, recounts the fact that, sometime during his youth, Julius Caesar, who found himself close to the Island of Rhodes in Greece, fell captive to pirates who seized the ship on which he was journeying. He was accordingly taken prisoner. In spite of such occurrence, he constantly held sway over their persons. More generally, he stuck throughout to a rather particular and, to an extent, ambivalent interaction with the pirates. He in fact incessantly dealt with them as if he was the one in control of their lives, in the process uttering to them, several times, a threat to the effect that he would order the execution of all of them unconditionally once he had regained his freedom 91 (which is exactly what he eventually did); at the same time, however, and rather paradoxically, Caesar authored quite a number of poems which he submitted to the critical evaluation of his own jailers.
