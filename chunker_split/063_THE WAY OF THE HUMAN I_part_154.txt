In this way we can observe them, see how they impact our life by constructing our internal subjective reality so that we can "let it go" or in Nisargadatta Maharaj's 88 ________________ Chapter VI words "discard it." The process is as follows: Only when a thought arises ask yourself, "To whom does this thought arise?" Answer to yourself, "To me." Then ask, "Who is this I?" This approach moves the "I" thought from being the subject (you), to making the "I" thought an object to be observed. The "I thought" will disappear and another "I thought" will appear and take its place. This process can be done with a partner. Pair up with partner. Make direct eye contact with them. Whenever a thought comes into the mind, the first person says it out loud. For example, "I don't like it," "I do like it," "it'as hot," "it's cold," "I wish I weren't here," whatever the thought is.
