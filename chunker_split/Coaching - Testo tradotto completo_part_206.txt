Ideal-based or life plan (It provides support for the other levels and defines them) ? ? ? Always present: Energy and existential attitude (Presence and enjoyment of the now and of acting in the now) ? ? Chronos and Kairòs are thus complementary. Regardless of how many opportunities and interests life might offer us (kairòs), if we are unable to function sequentially we shall waste them away, inasmuch as we will lack the capacity to grant a sequitur to such opportunities and interests (chronos). Kairòs is a vertical dimension which gets connected with the horizontal dimension of chronos, as if to create a + cross with it. Ideation, which corresponds to the horizontal line, comes into the picture here in the form of a logically conceived plane which is inspired by the absolute will to actualize it. The aforesaid further gets rid of preoccupation in one go. If, in fact, we know how to reach a result, there is no longer any reason to fear in the present. We might rather be able to live the present fully, and thereby unveil new opportunities. Making the movie of the future Predicting is pre-imagining. It is to see events as if in a movie.
