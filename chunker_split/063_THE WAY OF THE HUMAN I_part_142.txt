Thus the double-bind of either "I have a relationship and lose myself," or "I have myself and don't have a relationship." This creates some of the conflicts that constantly arise in relationships. I am often asked in workshops, "How can I have myself [my own space] and still have a connection with another [a relationship] ?" This exercise suggests you can have both by splitting your attention inside and outside so that they are equally balanced. To 82 Chapter VI repeat the approach given by Fourth Way teacher, G. I. Gurdjieff to his well-known student, P. D. Ouspensky, When I pay attention to the external world, I am like an arrow pointing outward. When I close my eyes and sink into myself, my attention becomes an arrow pointing inwards. Now, I try to do both at onceâ€”to point the arrow in and out at the same time-1 immediately discover that this is incredibly difficult. After a second or two$ either forget the outside world, and sink into a daydream, or forget myself and become absorbed in what I am looking at (Ouspensky, 1949).
