Though seclusion facilitates projection, when one is properly trained he might be able to isolate himself and plunge into mono-ideation even in the middle of a crowd, by losing any connection with what surrounds him. How to implement Projection: This second exercise consists in daily activating the plane of possibilities (virtuality), by transmitting to such plane a number of mental representations accompanied by imperious acts of volition which are directed at their actualization. One can also legitimately make use of multi-stage methodologies, such as self-magnetization as previously elucidated. Alternatively, you might simply contemplate your own ideation and say to yourselves: “Here is what I desire, which is, moreover, something that is bound to be accomplished” —, meaning in a tangibly embodied form. You must feel it as an actual fact, as something which is already in existence. An additional way, which acquires similar validity the more you gradually become more present to your own selves, might even consist in simply pleading with the universe to enable the full manifestation of your potential. Potentially, in fact, you are already a “homo totus”, equipped as such with the totality of possibilities and capacities you need in order to achieve what you want.
