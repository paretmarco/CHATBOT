In my case, the most powerful feeling of interconnection and unity with humanity I ever experienced was at my first Incest 148 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child Survivors Anonymous Group. Why? Because the lies I told myself and the pretending I played with others, in a moment of telling the truth, disappeared. It takes an immense amount of energy to hold back a secret and lie and pretend. When those lies are admitted as lies, the vulnerability and interconnection naturally occurs. This is the key point to remember. If our ultimate goal is to discover who we are, then the most important step is to look at our created internal realities, acknowledging their purpose, studying how they help us to resist or organize chaos. The final step is to discover ourselves as the observer and the creator of our internal images and experiences. This allows us to face ourselves more directly, and finally to break through beyond even the observer and the reality created by the observer. This is discussed and explored in detail in an experiential way in my book Quantum Consciousness: The Guide to Experienc- ing Quantum Psychology.
