If you, however, put yourselves in the state of mind, or we could say in the existential mood we have described a short while ago, you will carry out that motion spontaneously. Your interlocutor will start asking himself whether the two of you had not already met before somewhere, and at the very least, he will deal with you in a more intimate manner. At the time when you are about to formulate a business proposal: Do not direct your look elsewhere, and do not lower your eyes when you are about to articulate a business proposal. You should rather inquire about the object of your desire, and explain your deal in a few words, clearly and persuasively, by looking straight at the person you are busy addressing. Have a firm resolution to influence him, and keep in mind that you will have to do exactly what you would like him to do. Think of what you desire intensely. If you wish to influence a man, you should take care, once you have reached the kernel of the entire issue, the defining moment, not to allow him, if at all possible, to look at any thing other than your face.
