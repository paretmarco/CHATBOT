It follows that you should examine such person in an unbiased and benevolent fashion, prior to passing a judgment or taking a decision. Whoever practices these techniques must feel sufficiently strong in his self as to ipso facto eliminate, as a result of the said feeling, any attitude which differs from the most imperturbable benevolence vis-à-vis his fellow human beings. Those people whose modus operandi seemingly justifies contempt or total neglect are, after all, individuals whose psychological and physical condition has not yet enabled them to discern the true path. We must keep at a distance from them, until we deem ourselves powerful enough to influence them in a beneficial manner. It would however be a grotesque absurdity or a criminal act of foolishness to spare for them any thought, other than one of pity caused by noticing them in such a state, along with a moral incitement to them to change their character for the better. The most percipient trader, indeed, always makes space in his accounting books for an item which he labels «losses and profits». His wisest combinations might in fact reveal a weak spot which is going to occasion some losses.
