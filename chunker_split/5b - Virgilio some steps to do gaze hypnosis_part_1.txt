We call it hypnotism, but in reality its name is fascination, a very peculiar form of entrancing your subject. It is wide known? While hypnosis is well diffused, the peculiar form of fascination is very rare and very few people know it? Why so few people? I tried to figure out many reasons: the persons knowing the techniques didn't want to tell about it direct gaze hypnosis needs before a personal preparation in order to be rightly practiced But fascination is what people think hypnosis is in its purest form. With fascination you put the subject in a passive consciousness, in a dream. How long does it take? Fascinatipon could be very fast. You can achieve a very deep hypnotic state in about 3-4 seconds, without even speaking. Which type of states do you get in 3, 4 seconds? Many subjects will go in an amnesic state and not remember anything. They will do whatever will be asked. Do you prepare your subject? I think you can better take the subject if he doesn't know you are coming. Therefore you must surprise him. Speak directly, speak in order to create a surprise in him. How do you ask the subject to stay?
