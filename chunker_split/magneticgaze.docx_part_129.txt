In Italy, testimonies in that sense date back to the medieval period [69]. A similar phenomenon which is widespread nowadays is called “robberies through hypnosis”. In the course of such robberies, the subject is left in a state of passive consciousness, while the fascinator acts without any obstacle. We have gathered various testimonies in that regard. Such phenomenon consists in a specific form of application of fascination. A very peculiar method is what has been reported by the researches conducted by Dr. Tira, which we might legitimately catalogue under the name of “the gypsy woman of Castellamonte”, as they are based on a whole number of testimonies adduced in respect of such character. She would lead a person she targeted, in the space of a few seconds, into a very deep state which she would then exploit in a negative fashion. Her modus operandi consists in drawing close to the subject, seating him in the same way as she sits in front of him, and saying to him, ‘If you so desire, I can read for you your future ... Give me your hand …’.
