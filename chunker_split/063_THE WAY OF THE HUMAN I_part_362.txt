There I was, totally therapy trained for years, a client for years, years of meditation, years of living in India—when I looked around the room, there was a secretary, a painter, an astrologer, and a housewife. I realized that I was the same as them—and all of my defenses vanished. I instantly saw everyone there as the same. It was the most important "spiritual experience" I had ever had—it was a total connection to being human and to humanity. THE PROBLEM OF SEPARATION: THE GLUE THAT HOLDS SPIRITUAL TRANCES TOGETHER In guru/disciple, teacher/student, therapist/client and love relationships, separation is always a problem. If the guru/disciple, teacher/student or therapist/client is running trance-ference/ countertrance-ference issues (narcissistic), then the teacher, guru or therapist (just like mom and dad) becomes threatened at the possible loss (separation) of a disciple, student or client. This is why they put them down when they attempt to individuate. Teachers, gurus or therapists say things like, "They are not surrendered," "They are resisting," or "They have some worldly karma to work out."
