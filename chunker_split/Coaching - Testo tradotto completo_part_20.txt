Which is the person who – during a dream – has not authored verses or composed music, delivered lectures or solved problems, or formulated plans endowed with a power which far exceeded our capacities in the state of wakefulness? Yet all of that emanated from you, it was ensconced in you, implanted in your senses and in your brain. It means, therefore, that you are potentially far more than what you might presume to be. « I do not work; I listen», were the words De Musset used to address to whoever asked him about the modus operandi he utilized for his poems. As for Lamartine, he was accustomed to mention what follows: «I am not the one who is thinking. My ideas, rather, are the ones that think on my behalf». It is only within our essential being that we might detect the particular ideal we need to aspire to. It is from the viewpoint of such essential inward identity that the energies we require to achieve whatever we wish might arise. The contact that is established with one’s essential being is the result of actualizing a state of general “harmony”, and knowing how to utilize intuition.
