Here is a continuum of illusioning in the way the child disperses the energy of child abuse. People illusion having a relationship with this person or doing that activity, or illusion themselves swimming the English Channel. The key is being able to recognize them as illusions. The inner child sometimes has to do something to maintain his integrity of self. One client could not see me (blocking-out) to the point where he could just see my lips and hear my voice. In this manner, I at least maintained contact with him. The illusioning phenomenon occurs in degrees and is a continuum. Complementary Trances illusioning and blocking-out may occur simultaneously. Some- one might be hearing something that is not there, and blocking-out what is there. This phenomenon happens in relationships. For example, imagine a man and woman are getting together for the first time and the man says, "You look nice." The woman hears, "He wants to sleep with me." The woman says, "I'd like to have lunch with you" and the man hears, "She really wants to have a relation- ship with me." That is the illusioning-blocking-out process.
