Apart from the exercise with the mirror there is also another exercise that is very useful to be done apart from a few hours: standing, in a room perfectly dark, with the eyes closed, concentrate your mind trying to recall the experience above and trying to recreate the various psychophysiological reactions; whilst keeping the eyes open one may see some forms appear, sometimes brighter, and this appearing will be more precise as the ability develops. Later it will be also possible to develop the vision with closed eyes. FIRST PHYSICAL PHENOMENA - FIRST STAGE (? Earthly phenomena) The phenomena that you may begin to notice in practice with the mirrors are various. Stare at yourself on the third eye, where the nose touch the forehead, or, and some of the phenomena will appear faster, in the left eye. At the begin, a fog will appear around the image. The fog on the image reflected in the mirror slowly will become more dense after total and then goes darkening. After it will change its quality again taking a milky colour - at the beginning it will be just like a sensation - but after you will hawe a strange complete darkness where you will anyway see the boundaries of physical objects, surrounded by a strange light that could cover all ranges of the iris, from red to violet, with shades and tints unimaginable.
