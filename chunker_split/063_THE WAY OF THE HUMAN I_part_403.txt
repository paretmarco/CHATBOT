Poseidon (the whole universal mind) delivers this to Minos (the higher self) and asks Minos to destroy the Bull (sexuality.) This demonstrates a major division made in the body/mind by Poseidon (universal mind) "as if' sex were not a part of the body/ mind experience or the unified whole. This separation of body, mind and spirit demonstrates the imagined split between the body, the mind and the unified whole. it is interesting to note this since even Freud said that the ego is body-centered. This preconceived split is symbolically demonstrated by Poseidon's (the universal mind) dividing the whole universal mind into parts. This separation of body and mind from the unified whole makes sexuality (which is a body function) something to be destroyed. As mentioned throughout the book, this is a cornerstone understanding for various religions who see the body with its functions as bad and as something to be gone beyond, controlled or even destroyed (sacrificed) in order for enlightenment to come. 264 Appdendix Minos (the higher self or ESSENCE) cannot destroy the Bull because he sees its beauty (his connection to sexuality).
