At that point, verbalize the new, emotion-free state, look at a light for thirty seconds, and repeat the name assigned to the regained emotion of calm. Thereafter, close your eyes for about a minute and a half. The preceding exercise will further help you redirect the energy to new and more useful areas 45. You must constantly keep on thinking that emotion is but concentrated energy having the sole need of being re-orientated. The best option consists in fact in channelling energy to the task of briskly tackling the pending matters which demand rapid decisions and which, in normal conditions, one does not dare to complete. This is the cure founded on emotional release. It is however necessary to continuously persuade oneself that anger and fear are the two most powerful generative sources of the dispersion of forces. We are thus enjoined to uproot anger and fear from our innermost core, as we would then suddenly attain a vast spiritual calm. It is not enough that we should distance such twin emotions from us. We must move further from there to the actual denial of their existence in the soul of an educated, sensible and virile person.
