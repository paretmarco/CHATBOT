Erickson' s story of a man in a mental institution who thinks he is Jesus and sits waiting for his disciples also demonstrates this solidifying of illusions. The man/Jesus was so convinced that no therapists could talk him out of the trance. The story has it that Erickson utilized his trance to make a shift in his behavior. Erickson allegedly went over to the man and said, "I hear you are a carpenter." The Jesus/man is now in a double bind. If he says "no," then he's not Jesus. If he says "yes," then he doesn't know what will happen. He said "yes". Erickson said, "Come with me. There is some carpentry work that needs to be done in the new wing of the hospital." I don't know the conclusion to this story, but many of Erickson's stories seem to end with Erickson's illusion of health; and "He got married and had three children." In the development of illusions, the greater the stress in life the stronger the illusions.
