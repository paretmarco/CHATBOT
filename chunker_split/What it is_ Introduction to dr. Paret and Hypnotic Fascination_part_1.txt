Fascination, also known as hypnotic fascination, is a powerful tool that has been used for thousands of years to control the mind, manipulate human behavior or healing through deconstructing false concepts or releasing traumas. It is rooted in the ancient tradition of animal magnetism and has been a closely guarded secret of certain secret societies for centuries. The power of fascination lies in its ability to tap into the deepest parts of the human mind, allowing individuals to access their full potential and achieve greater success and personal power. In the past, techniques based on words were not as commonly used as they are today. Ancient hypnotists were able to hypnotize individuals quickly and without the use of words. Furthermore, if you read ancient texts, you will find that some ancient hypnotists were much more skilled than modern practitioners. Techniques such as mental suggestion, telepathy, and many other phenomena were well-documented in ancient texts. There is a secret behind these techniques that modern hypnosis lacks. Modern hypnosis techniques rely heavily on the use of words, but the results achieved by ancient practitioners were obtained without words. It is impossible to fully describe a nonverbal system with words.
