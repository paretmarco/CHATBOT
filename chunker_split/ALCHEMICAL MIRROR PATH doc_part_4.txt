Initiatory Path with Mirrors The fundamental exercises include the practice of viewing in a mirror. The use of this tool has both efficacity to increase the power of the eye as well this can also develop "astral vision" (in the Paracelsian sense) more effectively than any other tool. Most of the ancient fascinators practised this type of perception. A similar method is still practiced in the East, and this practice is called "Melong" and can also be practised on sheets of reflective metal. This practice is also conducted from antiquity in the Western countries. The mirror, in the Tibetan tradition is a polyvalent symbol, and also means clarity in the full sense of "purity primordial "(Tibetan ka dag) flow of consciousness. some of the traditions that rely on the use of a container full of water or jugs aim to develop of this ability. In the Western tradition I got in touch with one of my students, the Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, who was a prominent representative of a tradition of Egyptian origin. This tradition is linked to the presence to himself. I had a very long talk with him and I discussed the phenomenon. In the same tradition was the famous Cagliostro, that used a jug of clear water posted on a piece of furniture, and before it a child, on whose head the operator placed one hand and told him the questions to ask, to which replies were given in allegorical pictures.
