Stage 2: Begin by acquiring consciousness, alternately, of the right and the left parts of your head (at the rhythm of one second) Keep on doing it with that part, backward and forward, a few more times (at the same rhythm) Conclude the exercise by attaining alternate consciousness of the upper and lower parts of your head (A e B) You should now take and break, and then, if you so wish, you might start again. Anger Another element which poisons our activity is anger, that is, oneâ€™s vindictive excitation. Under the impulse of this evil adviser, our acts are almost always censurable, illogical, and disproportionate, and they are nearly invariably followed by regret. What we suggest here is never to act under the impulse of anger, which is after all a bestial rather than a human passion. Anger is an excess of self-defence, and the unlawful offspring of the survival instinct, hence of fear. If we become fully convinced of the close relationship between the two of them, we will be careful to avoid ever showing ourselves to be angry.
