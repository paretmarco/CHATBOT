- The Fluidic approach that reduced the complex mesmeric theory to the idea of a fluid going from the operator to the subject - The chevalier de barbarin and the spiritualists that deeply influenced Martinism, and that said that will and faith alone were the cause, as these elements touched superior dimensionalities - The Puysegurians. This group is originated from a pupil of Mesmer, the Marquis of Puysegur (S. M. G. de Chastenet, marquis de Puysegur 1751-1825), in magnetizing after the process of his master, succeeded in making a critical departure not yet fully developed until then, even if Mesmer himself knew of it, and to which he gave the name of magnetic or artificial somnambulism. This memorable discovery marks the decisive phase in a further evolution of original mesmerism. For the first time it puts the observer in presence of a characteristic and undeniable phenomenon. Up to that time, magnetizers studied above all the means of producing somnambulism or artificial sleep; and as soon as the fact was placed beyond doubt, it was interpreted in different manners and the main attention went on this phenomenon of apparent "sleep". After the death of Mesmer many other changes underwent to the original doctrine.
