THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE Quantum Psychology differs radically from any system, be it "psychological" or spiritual, which believes you are your False Core or False Self and which attempts to heal it, reframe it, make it "better," keep the "good," get rid of the "bad," convert vices into virtues, re-associate it, rename it, re-frame it, polish it and, ultimately, even observe it. Quantum Psychology suggests this is just moving around furniture. The question is, Who is moving the furniture and trying to re-form the False Core? Quantum Psychology maintains that any attempt to do these things contains an underlying judgment and assumption that you are your False Core. For Quantum Psychology you are not your False Core. Your False Core is not who you are. 37 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The more you identify with your False Core-False Self (even through transformation or healing), the more you reinforce it. According to Nisargadatta Maharaj, "In order to go beyond the mind, you must look away (take your attention) from the mind and its contents."
