One has, therefore, to mentally excite his potential faculties, by debarring them from getting released in small rivulets, and by channelling them, rather, towards the achievement of a specific result within a demarcated time period. The time span involved, and in any event the goal to be attained, will represent an essential variable, since it is only through such route that our organism is going to preserve the energy, without absorbing it back whenever there is a surplus of it. Besides, since we are never allowed to know every thing, and one never reaches the end of his task but that it is already time to die, it would seem logical that the most important study has to be the study of the means by which we can extend our existence, along with the presence in us of a resolute intention to pursue those means at any cost. As soon as you have realized that two glasses of wine per meal are enough, you should never consume three glasses of it. In a similar way, whenever you come to know that bread crumbs harm you, you must jettison their consumption for ever.
