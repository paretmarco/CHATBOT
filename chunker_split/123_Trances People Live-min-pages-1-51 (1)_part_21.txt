you might well answer, "Great! I felt like a kid again!" Basically, the beach environment has triggered an age-regressed state that appears to happen to you. After all, you didn't go to the beach with the conscious intention of creating an experience of playing like a kid again. Yet you did create that experience. The phobia trance is comprised of an onslaught dose of age regression wherein you are thrown back in time to when, as a very young child, you got knocked down by waves and felt like you were drowning. Hand-in-hand with this time traveling is an experience of pseudo-orientation in rime wherein you move forward in time to the imagined moment of catastrophe; and you experience an agonizing sense of time distortion: suddenly, time feels as if it is standing still andyou are frozen in the grip of your panic. Next, "waves" of posthypnotic suggestions ("I might die!... Get me out of here.. .1'm a bad boy for being here. . .1'm going to die!") wash over your thoughts to complete your single-pointed experience of fear. The kitty trance helps restore you to a more comfortable state.
