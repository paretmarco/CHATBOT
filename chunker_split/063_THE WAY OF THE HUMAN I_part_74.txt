Most descriptions of the Enneagratn types, however, do not describe the driver of the type, i.e., the False Core. Rather they describe and then define the personality type by the overcompensation to the False Core. This over-compensation is, in Quantum Psychology, the False Self and is a defense against the False Core. 35 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Core solidifies further. The solution is a False Self Compensator. Again, since you cannot get Mom to reflect back to you and be your mirror, you decide to be your mother's mirror and reflection through mind-readingÂ° what she wants and then giving it to her. This is done so that she will merge with you, and you will be in unity again. In this way, life becomes fixated on either trying to get people to merge with you (i.e., be their reflection) or to merge with them (they become your reflection). This is done in order to achieve a unity and thus not feel the shock of the Realization of Separation. ESSENCE becomes mis-labeled by the False Core as a deficiency or emptiness with a lack.
