From a moral perspective, you will have to clear out the way of all useless thoughts. “Discerning intelligently” signifies that one must be vigilant, and not blocked by opinions or automatic reflexes. Attaining mastery over the Mind and the Body Not only we engage in useless acts, but we also perpetuate useless physical tensions which devour energy from us. A general and usual defect in our body, which is an endless source of the dissipation of forces, is occasioned by the exaggerated tension of our muscles and nerves in the course of the day. This tension, which is unknown to animals in a state of rest or to small children, is the product of our artificial civilization and the vices associated with education. It is an aspect that must be rectified at every cost, whence the significance of relaxation. It is impossible to attain the concentration of one’s ideas without the simultaneous concentration of one’s physical movements: «The concentration of consciousness and the one of movements, the spreading of ideas and that of motions, go hand in hand» 20. Knowing how to relax through the suspension of useless movements, therefore, is an aid to focusing one’s attention 21.
