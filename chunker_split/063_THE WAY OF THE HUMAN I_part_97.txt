"I fantasized" two reasons for this: (1) "He" somehow knew it was not right for them. Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, "It is not for everybody"; and (2) "I imagine" when "he" felt you got ________________ Chapter II what you needed, he asked you to leave. Many times I heard him say, "I am not here to accumulate students." Once a woman traveled all the way from Europe. Nisargadatta Maharaj asked her, "How long are you staying?" She said, "Three months." "No, stay for a week or so until you understand it. If you stay too long, you will just listen to me and not do the work." This was the mark of a "teacher" who was student-centered, not self-centered. Everybody needs something different, something tailor-made just for them. Psychological and spiritual practices should be tailored to the individual. They should be student or client centered, not teacher centered. And teachers of each system should acknowledge the system's limitations and when called for, refer out.
