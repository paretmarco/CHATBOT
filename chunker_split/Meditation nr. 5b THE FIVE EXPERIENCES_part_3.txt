Meditation YOU ARE A KNIGHT You must stay in the reality You can go further in life Experience 5 : The Eighth Castle: overcoming fear of our energy and going beyond the bridge MAGICAL GUIDED IMAGINATION You are Perceval You see a castle beyond a bridge Perceval enters. He is a fierce knight He speak loudly He has a hammer in his hands and resonates with the hammer on a table A girl says him “the castle could fall if you speak so loud and you do so strong a sound”! But Perceval doesn’t fear it He is now master of this energy Perceval shows he has no more fear. And the women will serve him. It means if we have no fear we will have won The word courage comes from the word coeur that means hearth All preceding trials have purified your hearth We are now at another level
