Trances and thinking styles can come from the observer taking a picture of mom' s and dad' s behavior, and using it as a model for the future. The observer creates an inner child that is a duplicate of the parents. The observer then goes to sleep and the created inner child walks like, talks like, acts like, sounds like, and even feels the same as the parents feel toward life. This is why so often, if you have children, you act and talk to your children, just as your mother or father acted or talked to you. In the fallacy of fairness, a certain value system is generally absorbed by the child from Mom, Dad, or both, which teaches the child what is fair. For example, Mom and Dad had an unspoken agreement that Dad works and Mom stays home with the kids. This trade-off is thought of as "fair." If Mom wants to go visit her sister for a few days, Dad says, "That's not fair." Let's say Mom and Dad pay for your schooling, and you drop out.
