For example, during a 1992 TV interview Alec Baldwin said, "I could not believe people were asking presidential candidates about family values. I was waiting for Bill Clinton to say,. 'Hey, I am not your father, decide what values you want for your family, it's not up to me'." This astute statement by Baldwin was describing how "family values" voters look to politicians, the church or gurus to tell them how to live. Thus the age-regressed voter wants mommy/daddy, i.e., the church or politicians, to tell them the "right" family values. Another example is the recent landslide election in the 1994 Congress. Here again, as the Republicans go back to tax breaks for the wealthy so that it will trickle down to us, we see voters in an age-regression. The basic principle of trance-ference is that the greater the survival needs, the greater the tendency to age-regress.
