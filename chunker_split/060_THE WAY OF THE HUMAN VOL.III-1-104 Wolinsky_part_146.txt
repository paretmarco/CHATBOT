2. It appears to create what it observes, though this too is an illusion; the observer imagines it is the source of the thought, experience, etc.' 3. The observer appears to come prior, to be senior to—as if it existed before the observed—that which it is observing, which it does not, the observer arises and subsides with that which it observes. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The observer and the observed are one and they arise and subside together as one piece. THE WITNESS Going beyond the observer-observed dyad leads us to the WITNESS. The WITNESS is the one who is aware of the observer-observed dyad and is unaffected by it. It can be said that the WITNESS is the "NOT-I-I" since it does not have an identity but is pure awareness. In other words, it contains awareness of the observer-observed dyad yet remains unaffected by it. It is an "I" as pure awareness, being aware of the BIG EMPTINESS and yet remaining unaffected by the observer-observed (experience).
