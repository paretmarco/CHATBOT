Another difference between animal hypnotism and mainstream clinical hypnosis is how words are used. In our school ISI-CNV we have created a name: "counterlinguistics" for this very strange happening. For example all hypnosis and communication schools teach not to use the word "not" as you do an induction. However, it could be both perfectly fine to avoid using the word "not" in doing a hypnotic gaze induction, as it is surprisingly also perfectly fine to use it. Sometimes you will get even better results! You can repeat for example to a subject doing a movement: "you cannot block your hands", or even "you shouldn't be able to block your hands" and he will continue the movement and even enhance it. A reason could be that we are speaking with the unconscious animal mind. It reacts primarily to our intention. It is the conscious mind that reacts primarily on words. Thus as we get the results notwithstanding the language we are enhancing the power of the unconscious. Another difference is that you must never mirror the subject with your words.
