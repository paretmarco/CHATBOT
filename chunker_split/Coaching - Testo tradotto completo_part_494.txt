Do not think of what ought to be, but rather of what is in that precise moment. Put a plan into practice, along with whatever is required in order to accomplish the hoped for result, and then refrain from halting with your thought on anything else. Whoever complains will suffer failure. If you do not do as instructed, you will inevitably risk casting yourself into the role of a usual victim: The victim blames – everyone is guilty of something. By pursuing that attitudinal avenue, the relevant person exempts himself from any responsibility, and eventually reaches the point where he unconsciously says: “My objective is not so important and easy to attain, as it does not truly depend on me; it is therefore important to simply devote myself to live my emotions”. Of, course such a person runs into failure by taking that route. What is needed in order to come out of this trance is not to trace any possible failure to the lack of available capital or bad luck, which is but an element you cannot affect by your personal intervention, but rather to trace it to your own selves. It is only then that you might begin a process of self-transformation.
