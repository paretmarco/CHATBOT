ADVICE AIMED AT OVERCOMING FEAR: Breathe, and carry out the exercise centred on the discharges. Try thereafter to lower the threshold of fear by directing your concentration beyond it, to your objective, thereby enlarging your perception of time. ANXIETY: It is the underlying cause of overtrading and stress. In order for you to transcend it, you should act in the same way as you do when tackling the emotion of fear, inasmuch as it derives from a problem of temporal horizon. We are anxious because we are no longer able to discern our objective, being restricted to the capacity of perceiving only the immediately next moment. Regularly practice a technique of self-hypnosis, by visualizing your true objective at the precise time when it needs to be attained. CUPIDITY: Cupidity is the causative agent of inappropriate PURCHASES. Here is an advice: Having some objectives is also useful to the purpose of fixing a "threshold of satisfaction", and not to allow ourselves to be seized by such emotion. Each one of you should always ask his self: What is my objective? WANTING TO PROVE OURSELVES RIGHT: Keep always in mind the fact that the market is, invariably, the only one to be right.
