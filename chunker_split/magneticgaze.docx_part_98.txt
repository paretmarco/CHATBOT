When we succeed in unravelling the underlying mechanism, we might be able to help the person suffering from such a modification of reality be more firmly anchored in the present, and, accordingly, effectively manage to accomplish some things in life. The look-centred therapy represents a powerful tool to take him back to the present and enable him to re-establish contact with it. This therapy empowers the switch from ‚Äúdreaming‚Äù to ‚Äúbeing active and orientated toward the future‚Äù. Daydreaming is not negative per se. On the contrary, it might even be useful: A positive image, for instance, occasions positive emotions [47]. It is the first stage of the mechanism by which motivational urge is brought about. A young lad, for example, might presage the taste of the moment in which he is going to graduate. Future visual impression (the person, e.g. imagines his graduation) ü°∫ positive sensation. The problem is that it is befitting, in order for the person thus motivated to engage in tangible action, that this first step should be conjoined to an additional second step: This is the practice which invariably uses the present as its departure point.
