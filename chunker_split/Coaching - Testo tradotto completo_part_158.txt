One reaches the eventual point at which he has mastery over his own self, and he is capable of retaining an imperturbable serenity even in the most awfully pathetic circumstances, by beginning to subjugate, through the help of a small effort, the emotionalism which everyday impulses generate. An enormous consumption of strength escorts the fulfilment of emotional impulses. Do not argue therefore in an animated manner. Do not debate. Listen calmly when something is being communicated to you, and do not express your opinion unless you cannot possibly do without it. Do not allow yourself to be compelled into speaking against your will. It is by beginning to dominate a slight motion of impatience that one ultimately soars to the degree at which he can keep his impassive cool even in the face of serious provocations. Feeling disappointed, irritated or enervated occasions certain physiognomic expressions, gestures and vocal outbursts, which we must ban from our selves at every cost.
