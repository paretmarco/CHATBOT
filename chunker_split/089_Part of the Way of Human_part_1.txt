The Way of the Human â–  Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Dr. Carl Ginsberg says it this way: For potent, erect action, the extensor system must bring the skeletal structures to a center core around which action can he organized. I am convinced that the sensing of this skeletal security equates with the ability to he present in the moment, and to act without self interference or overt over-conscious control. A very young child can hold the head in near perfect balance with clear support from the central structural core of spine and pelvis. Fear, however, produces the flexor responses which contract the system away from this core of support, and require that muscular action be produced to counteract this contraction in order for the person to continue to be able to act in gravity. ln the ideal state all action is produced with an even distribution of tonus throughout the musculature. In the more typical situation this clarity of organization is lost through the overlay of responses including emotions, feelings and thoughts impressed by parents and social conditioning.
