(New Anthology – Roma – 1883 – p. 71 – p. 280) The Virgil T. method consists in the numerological sum of the letters of name, surname and date of birth. To this sum, you count also foreign letters.

These deities are symbolized by the Lion for the Dies Solis (Sunday), the Fawn for Dies Lunae (Monday - Diana Venatrix), the Scorpion for Dies Martis (Tuesday), the Dog for Dies Mercurii.
