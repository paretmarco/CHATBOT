PMID 17042793) PERIPHERAL MOVEMENT ABSORBING This refer to absorbing the spirit of the person in front of us Diploplia Though physiological diploplia is seldom noticed in everyday life, it is readily perceived when attention is drawn to it. For example, if a pencil is held vertically a short distance in front of the eyes while a more distant object is steadily fixated, the pencil will be seen in crossed diploplia. Hence the rule: uncrossed diploplia occurs when the object is farther than fixation, crossed diploplia when it is nearer than fixation In general, the diplopic images are out of focus and insubstantial. Any impression of their distance from the eyes would be greatly influenced by prior knowledge of the actual positions of objects in question, especially if the nearer one is held in hand. This means that by movement, once a first diploplia has been obtained through dark focus concentration, we can render our position uncertain.
