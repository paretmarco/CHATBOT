Elements of Quantum Coaching which are essential in order to develop opportunities Openness to intuition In the light of the fact that our mind is naturally created so as to interface with a random world, the good functioning of the mind is the key which enables us to reach the optimal result. Reasoning in terms of opportunities, therefore, also means to open oneself up to intuition, which is that function of our mind with the capacity of tracing for us new roads for the future. This accordingly bears the meaning of being more openly receptive to synchronicity, inasmuch as our unconscious mind is more apt for the purpose of seizing opportunities, when it is viewed comparatively with the unconscious mind. Openness to the world The method we are offering you through our coaching is essentially one that causes you not to take certain paths for granted or to decide under the negative influence of our memories or emotions. Our memories do in fact form a closed system which cannot know more than what it already contains. An opportunity-based system, by contrast, necessitates a continuous curiosity to explore the world, without letting ourselves be guided by objectives which are too closed.
