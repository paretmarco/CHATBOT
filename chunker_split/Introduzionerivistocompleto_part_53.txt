If you spoke to your child what would you say to him/ her? A QUICK TIME LINE EXERCISE CLOSE YOUR EYES. CLOSE THE BLOCK WE ONCE HAD INTO A FIST. THEN THINK OF WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE NEEDED AND SQUEEZE IT IN THE OTHER FIST. THEN SQUEEZE BOTH FISTS AT THE SAME TIME. YOU WILL FEEL AN EMOTIONAL CHARGE. Like all metaphors of reality, the time line is just an instrument that guides people to make changes in the way they perceive the world and themselves. Its main advantage is in its ability to project the person into the hypothetical future, making him/ her live possible future situations beforehand. There is also the ability to take him/ her into past times to reconstruct them in an opportune way. To be able to use the time line, however, it is necessary to understand the subject in a deeper way and to be helped by an NLP expert, for initially, you could meet with difficulty travelling along it. When you are able to pass over all of your time line, starting from the beginning of the past until arriving ahead of the future, observing all past experiences and all those yet to be experienced, which will be many more and even more satisfactory, useful and happy, you will be aware of the ability to control your life. Every time you travel on the time line with pleasurable feelings of internal capacity, you will come back to the present.
