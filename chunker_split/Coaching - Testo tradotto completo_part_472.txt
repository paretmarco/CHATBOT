Money viewed in isolation has no value. It only becomes endowed with value at the moment when it serves as a trampoline for us to realize clearly defined goals. What I mean to say is that monetary funds might be utilized so as to buy extremely costly cars or the company of those people who swarm around us, in order to attain selfish goals and for the like of such motives. In such a case, our unconscious might not be fully in agreement; the task our conscious is vested with, in fact, consists in safeguarding our persons and lending us protection, knowing fully well that should we be furnished with a lot of money, we might adopt an irresponsible course of conduct. It is thus important to think of and imagine a situation wherein, should we be regaled with a wider pool of monetary resources, we might make life more pleasant both for ourselves and for those who are the closest to us. Pay thoughtful heed to what are the purposes which inform your life, and firmly set for yourselves a cluster of noble aims on which you are going to found your behaviour, whereupon your unconscious will lend you assistance in attaining them.
