Such an interpretation is corroborated by Seligmann [63], who was a professional ophthalmologist. Seligmann observes that, in Greek, “Hyppos”, i.e. the word for “horse”, was in fact the noun by which the ancient Greeks used to call the nystagmus. Even among the Assyrians, the power of the eyes was linked to their motion [64]. Rotational look: Erminio from Pisa used to rotate the eyes in connection with divergent strabismus. Look based on a horizontal movement: Prof. Hoehn advices the operator to look to the right and the left of the subject’s nose “depending on what is most suitable”. 3. The way the eyes should be kept An effective method is to keep one eye more open than the other [65]. 4. Pupil Even the dilated pupil (mydriasis) is quite effective when it comes to the purposes sought to be achieved by fascination. This method, too, is an ancient one that is probably quoted by Pliny, who refers however to people with a “double pupil”.
