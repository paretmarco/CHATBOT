Too many people move with excessive ease from one thought to another, and show interest, almost simultaneously, in two such mutually heterogeneous issues that we might essentially assert that they are entertaining both of them together. They are clearly two abortions which are destined to be thrown into the immensely vast limbo of foetal thoughts. Sometimes one thought destroys another, only to be annihilated by the one immediately succeeding it. Sure, one comes across a spontaneous generation of ideas which would be wrong to ban, since the so-called “lateral” thoughts are almost invariably pregnant with valuable findings. We merely want here to raise a barrier against the harmful habit of switching abruptly from one thought to another, for then we would be allowing ourselves to be distracted by every triviality. We have to master the art of suddenly deflecting the mind away from any idea or subject-matter. As for creativity, we are now going to explain how it should be developed. It is precisely by blocking thoughts at some points in time that we might be able to produce geniality.
