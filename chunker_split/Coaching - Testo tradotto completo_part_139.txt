When emotion is added to some fact or some thought, in fact, it stirs up in us violent responses which hinder action rather than favouring its explication, exactly the way the gas obstructs the march of the engine whenever it is compressed too much. Acting on the emotions Apart from our mental side, namely, the mindâ€™s incessant chattering, the inward radio broadcasts which we are endlessly forced to endure from it, the other main cause that might prevent us from progressing, therefore, is emotion. Emotion consists in the loss of mental balance. It is a form of inebriation in a true sense of the word. Emotion is a degenerate form of energy. In order to expend the totality of our forces, we must have mastery on ourselves and thus consume the least possible number of emotions. We must realize that emotion, every emotion, distances us from the perception of reality, and that it is only within reality that we need to build things. Reality is emotion-free. It only contains objective data.
