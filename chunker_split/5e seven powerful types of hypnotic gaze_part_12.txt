But very few know there is also a much simpler way to give a similar impression of depth that you can use in hypnosis, sometimes even stronger, just looking at the chin. The feeling will be very similar. Some shamans as well use this technique. - Adding width to the gaze and excitating the full potentials of our subject While primitive humans were highly attentive to their environment, modern man is inattentive to most of his complete field of vision. Most of the time we are only concentrated on the central part of our vision (the fovea) and we do not use our peripheral vision. As the eye is connected to the brain, this also involves that we are only using a part of our brain. If we want our gaze to be more powerful, we must add width to it including also the lateral vision in our consciousness. This advanced technique is very simple. It is just an act of attention. We must try to be conscious of our surroundings as we look at our partner. In order to do it, please pick two spots at the very edge of your vision and try to stay conscious of them. Always try to keep consciousness of where you are.
