In other words, I used spiritual philosophy to re-enforce the denial of the animal (biological) as well as the psychological. This self-defeating tendency to divide yourself by "taking on" psycho-spiritual belief systems, techniques, philosophies and identities has, more often than not, created more divisions externally, i.e., us and them, pd,internally, i.e., spiritual or higher parts trying to subdue "lower" parts and emotions. With this in mind, The Way of the Human asks us not to get rid of anything but to study and appreciate everything, not to destroy but to enjoy, not to disembody but to embody and be present. The Way of the Human starts with where you are as the link that connects to the underlying unity. Simply stated, to be human and embody is a form of biological spirituality. It is the way to connect to humanity, which is here and now and which is the underlying unity. The purpose of Quantum Psychology can be summarized as the development of multi-dimensional awareness as a vehicle that might help you discover WHO YOU ARE. Incidentally, I underlined might since there are no guarantees nor can an individual promise that there will be.
