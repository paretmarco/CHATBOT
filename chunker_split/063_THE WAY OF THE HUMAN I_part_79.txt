And wherever your mind moves, it is a movement to resist the pain of your False Core. A student of Swami Muktananda let him know he was going to take a vacation for a week. Muktananda replied, "Tell me a place where you can go and not take your mind with you and I will go there with you." The problem is, "What is driving these movements of your mind?" It is the False Core. When you "get that," you don't move. You stay just prior to it (the False Core) and dismantle it until it dissolves in the nonverbal "I AM." When it dissolves, "you" and your subjective experience of your psychology dissolve. With your False Core gone, "your" psychology, and what you call "you," has no place or ground to land on; "you" have no location in space-time. This movement of the mind to resist the False Core is a must for the "I" experiencing the False Core because anything is better than feeling the False Core structure.
