The Latins used to teach us the following: «Prima charitas incipit ab ego» (“The very first charity begins with oneself”), to wit: We must take care of the others, while paying attention to ourselves as well. We are the only unassailable reality which we are caused to meet in this world. True success is intimately linked to individual fulfilment and to exteriorized actualization in the world of our natural talents. It is thus primarily a personal success, while it is a social goal only in a subordinate sense. What we mean by «success», therefore, is the art of bettering and multiplying our specific gifts in accordance with our ideals, as well as the art of knowing how to utilize them fruitfully in every possible way. “Positive exploitation” has both an economic and an existential signification. Going back to the metaphor of the tree and the fruit it yields, if we use fruit as an image for one’s actions, then the trunk is represented by our being which ought to allow energy to flow, while the root consists in our deep individualized being, which is entrenched in the ground.
