Therapeutic Note: Here we see how in family therapy they say a child imagines she is helping mom. In this situation she is able to have a relationship with mom by dampening her own fire Wolinsky:What I would like for you to have over there is an image of a little girl, and what I would like for you to do, is notice the fear. Have the light inside the little girl and then the numbness to protect the light and the little girl taking on the fear of the mother so as to help the mother. Does it seem accurate to you? Therapeutic Note This demonstrates Reich's emotional plague. Briefly stated, we feel threatened by another's aliveness and try to damp it down or destroy it as ours was dampened clown or destroyed. "Do onto others that which was done onto you." Wolinsky:So she got scared of yours because she was scared of her own. Nancy:Uh-huh. Wolinsky:So this fear is actually your mother's. Can you delabel that fear and allow that energy of fear to go back to your undertaker mother? Nancy:No, that's dangerous to do. Wolinsky:Why would that be dangerous?
