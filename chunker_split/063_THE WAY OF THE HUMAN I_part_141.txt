It is like the story told by Swami Muktananda about people who bathe in the Ganges. In India it is believed that if you bathe in the Ganges your sins are washed away. But sins (uncooked seeds), according to Mukananda, go up into the trees so that after you come out of the water (meditation), they jump back on you. This is the problem with refusing to look at issues that arise in the thinking or emotional dimension and stabilizing in the no-state state. In meditation, "I" could sit quietly and enter into the NOT or disappear in the VOID. However, like the Ganges, "I" would be bathed and my sins (uncooked seeds) would disappear. But shortly after "I" arose from meditation (the Ganges) my mind with all its issues would come back. The next step after the first dimension of awareness of the external is to develop a two-dimensional awareness by incorporating the thinking dimension. Often, in relationships we lose ourselves by focusing on our partner. Others lose their connection because they remain distant and aloof.
