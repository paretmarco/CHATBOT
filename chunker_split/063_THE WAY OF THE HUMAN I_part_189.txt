In order to do this, we must take things one step further and look at the business of psychology and spirituality to notice how we have all been indoctrinated and hypnotized into this understanding, even in the light of quantum physics which states that everything is a unified whole. EGO PSYCHOLOGY I would like to begin by stating that I love the story and philosophy of psychology. It is a marvelous story. Ego psychology, and/ or psychoanalytic developmental psychology have made important observations about early childhood development and its implications and applications to our psychological processes. I do not wish to throw the baby out with the bath water; however, I do wish to examine how psychoanalytic developmental psychology views, encourages and supports the mind being split-off from the body and how many of their philosophies and theories are taken as facts and remain unquestioned. This can be best described in the statement below: Lichtenberg's description of psychological structuring is as a process in which the child develops the capacity to live a little less in the body and a little more in the mind.
