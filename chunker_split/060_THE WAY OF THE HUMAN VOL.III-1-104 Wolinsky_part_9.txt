They are placed "in," "on," or hidden within the (mis)perceived emptiness (as in a lack) which, though it is not ESSENCE is perceived as ESSENCE. This makes ESSENCE appear as the repository and the cause for all problems. For this reason, the False Core Driver (the label) and Identities are seen as I or "me" and ESSENCE, I AM, the VOID, etc., as "Not me" (to be discussed later). The "existential crisis" (the emptiness and meaningless of life) is a misnomer. It only describes the (mis)labeling placed by this (mis)perception onto ESSENCE. Simply stated, unlabeled EMPTINESS is spaciousness and an Essential quality of ESSENCE. When this Essential quality is labeled as "bad," like depression, for example, this creates an existential crisis which, in turn, leads to the desire (and problem) of organizing (giving a reason for) the chaos of the shock of the Realization of Separation and the narcissistic wound.
