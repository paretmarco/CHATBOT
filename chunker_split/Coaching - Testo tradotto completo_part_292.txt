What we find linked to it is effective action, which is even more effective whenever it minimizes the effort made by the mental side, by one’s inner dialogue, that is, by the higher centres of the brain, which, though useful for the task of taking decisions, are, nevertheless, not as useful for us being able to carry out a logical series of operations. Every act must be executed mentally, with resolution but without any useless mental tension. We must grant the human machine a chance to work towards a goal, the chance of “watching its own self act”, as we limit our intervention to those situations where it is necessary. The human being has in fact, in his own self, a perfect system to reach whatever he wants to accomplish, provided it is founded on a uniform intent and on the presentifying of future states (i.e. causing them to be present). In most cases, there is not even any need to engage in tiresome conscious visualization. In a like manner, as we cross the road we do not conjure up a visualization of how the cars will move at different speeds.
