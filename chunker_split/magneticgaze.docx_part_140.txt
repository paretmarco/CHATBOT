As stated by Baron Karl von Reichenbach (1788-1869), who carried out a number of experiments in this regard, “there are some people on whom looking at themselves in the mirror confers ... an imppression of weakness ... Such people do not usually look at themselves in the mirror, and in fact cannot even stand their own look” (Cf. Reichenbach, “Briefe”, p. 6).
