People who are exceptionally talented, that is, those who think in neat and forceful ways, ask themselves questions marked by the quality of being precisely defined, and escort the act of posing those questions to their own persons by such an intense desire to get a reply to them that the result cannot but materialize very rapidly. As for the second phase, to wit, the phase during which we set ourselves in a reflective state so as to gather those inspirations which have become defined in the course of the specific day or in the days immediately preceding it, it is a phase which is gone through, therefore, after we wake up from sleep. That is the time when the soul, being steeped in a more passive condition, displays a more pronounced receptiveness to the vibrations which befall it. The whole effort that needs to be made at this stage consists in keeping one's thought orientated towards the questions for which a reply is expected. Oftentimes, the reply thereto does not take place in one go, especially in those scenarios where the conditions sine qua non for a response to emerge are rather complex in nature.
