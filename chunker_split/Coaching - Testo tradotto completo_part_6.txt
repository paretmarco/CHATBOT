A depressed person, a person enslaved by some habitual routine, or a bored individual, might ostensibly achieve success in a chance manner, such as by winning the lotto associated with sports results. But even on the assumption such people “won” in that sense, they would probably be unable to know what to do with the money thus gained, and they would soon fritter it away in some useless undertakings. What we call “desire to live” is, by contrast, a vital energy, the sole desire of which is to find an external outlet of self-expression. It is a desire to be and to enjoy the universe. By self-exteriorization, such desire naturally leads one to attain the benefits of concrete results and felicity. Those who score the highest are also people who find pleasure in living and in all the marvellous aspects which the world can offer. It is precisely this pleasure which engenders attentiveness to life, which makes one discover opportunities and develop them, and which allows him to be persevering.
