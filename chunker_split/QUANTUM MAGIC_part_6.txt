This reality can not be accounted for by any force of interaction between independent entities, but can be understood as a process of enfoldment in a higher dimensional space [1]. Information within the quantum wave determines the outcome of the quantum process. This information is potentially active everywhere but only actually active when and where it enters into the energy of an observed particle, implying that all particles have complex inner structures [10]. o Recently, superstring theory has been proposed, describing a ten dimensional webwork of space-time at an incredibly small scale (1E-33 cm) underlying the phenomenon described statistically by quantum mechanics, relatively, particle physics etc. Some scientists consider speculation about the nature of the underlying reality to be irrelevant, since the predictions of quantum mechanical equations match the statistics of the results of experiments. To the best of my knowledge, experiments have not been performed that unambiguously distinguish between these alternative world-views. On the other hand, experiments have been proposed; and some work is underway to check some predictions of superstring theory. Eventually, from the results of experiments, some of these hypotheses may be screened out and others elevated to the level of scientific theory.
