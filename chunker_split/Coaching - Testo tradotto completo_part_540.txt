It might even happen that one formulates it in a specific way because his life is now drawing to its end, or because it is compelled by circumstances to convert into something immutable, due for instance to the fact that one's young age makes the future inscrutable or the individual concerned lacks the confidence which is required to apply the method in a total way. When that is the case, the life plan might be provisionally shelved aside, and one's prediction might be limited to developing an ideal for a shorter time span, say, an annual or monthly ideal or even a mere weekly one. On the strength of all or some of these plans which are mutually interrelated, we might, every evening, set about the task of laying down the plan for the next day, or an estimate of our future activity. For us to draft it, we will be called upon, as a first step, to review the elements which we would like to work on, and to analyze ourselves from every possible visual angle, both as isolated individuals and as part and parcel of a social plurality and of the Universe as a whole.
