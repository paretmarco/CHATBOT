FLUIDIFICATION USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo) HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM IMPORTANT POINTS Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions MAGNRETC MAPS Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS: Rage, Presentation on a theory on the work of magnetism. A research done by a finnish University shows the different zone of activation in the body FOUR TYPES Presentation of four types Choleric Lymphatic Sanguine Menlancholic ========================================================= EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active. Se we have a first big split HYPER HYPO Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER? Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism Many times we observe that HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic) LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic) SANGUINE (ambo-tonic) MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic) Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it.
