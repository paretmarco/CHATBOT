What we call «substitution of personality» is that part of a process which consists in imagining an action as if it has been carried out, not by ourselves, but by some other person, whose spirit, abilities and praiseworthy features have penetrated our own selves, and which we then exploit so as to implement that action in the best possible way. This procedure, — which might appear to be something magical and odd —, is however endowed with a scientific basis that might be defined as follows: When we physically represent ourselves as being a specific person we are personally familiar with, one we imagine to be in need of undertaking a particular action, our psychological state undergoes a transformation by identifying it with the state of the selected “substitute” individual. That will occur to a greater or lesser extent depending on the intensity of our mental representation. What we are dealing with, in short, is the well known physical-psychological correlation pursuant to which, by adopting a specific expressive posture of the face and the body, our spirit eventually comes to take over, step after step, the very state which corresponds to the relevant expression 65.
