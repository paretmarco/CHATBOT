By means of fascination, we as the operators might prove to be an important resource of the present for our patient, one that is indeed capable of activating the said link [48]. Technical characteristics of this state: We can often notice in it a hyperopic attitude, which is focused on what is distant. The visionary gazes at some distant point [49]. Treatment The standard application of the relevant technique is extremely simple: We should fix our look on the patient and, at the moment in which we have reached the stage of fascination, we are going to conjoin the future state to the present one by uttering some encouraging words and by asserting that the subject shall henceforth work towards accomplishing his own goal. One might say for instance, ‘From now on you will act with confidence. Every day you should take a new step towards your ultimate objective.’ What would otherwise happen is that this type of persons will fail to act in the present, and will only live out their particular dreams. Treatment in the event of fear of the future (anxiety) Even what is called “anxiety” is linked to time [50].
