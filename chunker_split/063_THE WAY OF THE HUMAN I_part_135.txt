It involves not only our thoughts and images but also fantasies, values, beliefs, concepts, ideas and perceptions. In order to understand this dimension, it is necessary to deepen "our" internal focus and develop our awareness of what is happening inside our psyche. Otherwise we will never see present time, never experience people or situations or objects in the here-and-now. Thoughts and images do not create external reality, a point often misunderstood. However, they do create our interpretation and our internal subjective experience of our external reality, if we believe them. And hence our subjective experience of the internal gets projected onto the external. For example, if I change my thought called "You do not like me" to "You like me," "I" internally might have the experience of, "You like me" but whether you like me or not might not be affected. Why is it important to know how the internal thinking world works? Nisargadatta Maharaj was once asked, "Why should we meditate (enquirer" He replied, Of the outer world, we know a lot. Of the inner world, we know very little.
