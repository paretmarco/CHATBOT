151 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The only real "spiritual" experience is the no-experience experience, the non-verbal "I AM" or the pure awareness of the NOT-I-I of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE . QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Any experience that is dissociated from the other dimensions of awareness is not grounded in the whole. Therefore, it can lead to a distortion of reality and not THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. This is why so many mediators have "spiritual" ideas about spirituality. In Quantum Psychology, your idea of spirituality is not spirituality. Spirituality is a no-experience experience. It has neither meaning nor purpose. not appreciating this is why the changeless background of "spirituality" goes unnoticed. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Any idea you have about spirituality is not spirituality. Spirituality has no ideas. It is not even the idea of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. BIOLOGICAL CORE YOGA A body yoga or a core yoga is a natural yoga. Once the breakages in Awareness and splitting off end, there is a no more trancingout (see Trances People Live or The Dark Side of the Inner Child).
