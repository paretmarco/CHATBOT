In these two trances, the inner child ( I) defends himself from who the person truly is, and (2) trance-fers this defensive style on his spouse making them his ideal, thus protecting the old reality and avoiding the new reality. In most cases, the trance of idealization is a powerful defense the child uses to help her survive. The idealization trance enables the child to not feel, see, or even recognize the pain in her dysfunctional family . 132 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child Spiritualization The Third Level Processes Spiritualizing is the third level trance. It is an outgrowth of levels one and two. In order to spiritualize, an individual must go through the first two levels. Spiritualization is very deep, rooted in pre-verbal cognition and deeply involves survival. Spiritualizing is difficult to spot within oneself because books, philosophies, and "spiritual groups" help to validate the trance and continue to hypnotize the infant within the adult. It should be noted that not everyone goes through the trance of spiritualization. If an individual developmentally does not complete and pass through process one and the second process completely, they will stumble into the third process of spiritualization.
