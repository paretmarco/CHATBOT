What I have seen is that any habitual fixation of awareness in any dimension creates an experiential limitation from the full spectrum of humanity. One of the purposes of Quantum Psychology, therefore, is to develop a functional awareness. This means that in the beginning stages, while awareness is still there, developing the ability to place awareness in any dimension. To paraphrase, noted Sufi Master Indries Shah, "In order to be free, we must be able to gain choice over where we place our awareness." SUMMARY OF THE DIMENSIONS Please note, the line connects all dimensions showing that they are connected and influence each other; however, they do have different functions: The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness CHAPTER V THE EXTERNAL DIMENSION OF MANIFESTATION "You never put your foot in the same river twice" DIMENSION I: THE EXTEINAL WORLD A t first glance, we would say, "Oh, that's easy. Just be aware of what's happening around you." The ability to experience the external is to see people, situations, objects, etc., without using your thoughts, memories, emotions, associations or perceptions.
