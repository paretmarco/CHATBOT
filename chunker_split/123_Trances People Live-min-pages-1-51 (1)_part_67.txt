(pp. 337-338) [italics added] What an excellent summary of the Ericks. onian principle of utilization. formulated hundreds of years ago in an entirely inde- pendent context!

Another way of stating this principle of paradox as it applies to therapy is, by asking clients to do what it is they do, trance naturally fm :us. They shrink their focus of attention, and by doing so, they pop into a no-trance state —which means they arc in a state of comfort and harmony, free of attachments and identifications. Me4litation contains the same paradox: by narrowing the focus of attention. the anent ion event ual ly becomes diffused and detached.
