For this reason, to give myself more leeway, and as a way to have the book available sooner to the public, I decided to use the subtitle of The Quantum Psychology Notebooks. This "took me off the hook" in trying to produce a manuscript of great literary value, and gave me the possibility of releasing the material sooner, I did not want to go over all of the material in the last five books. I wanted this work to stand on its own, hence the idea of calling the three Volumes notebooks seemed like a good idea.
