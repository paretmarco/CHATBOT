For example, in an examination setting, where a young person tends towards anxiety, a sensation of self-control and calmness can be anchored, to which they can access in their time of need by way of its attachment to a part of the body (the arm for example). Generally speaking, therapeutic anchors are of kinaesthetic type, in other words, tactile. In fact, it is much easier for a person to touch a part of the body than see an image or hear a sound. Subsequently, the operator can evoke in the subject a specific state of mind and, at the same time, make him associate it with a stimulus. EXERCISE Think about a negative emotion that you want to free yourself from and anchor by pressing your knee. Now, what is it that you would have needed at that moment? Anchor negatively by pressing the other knee. Then employ the two anchors at the same time (anchor failure). METAPHORS A metaphor is a story or tale that makes changes in those who listen. In NLP, metaphors are used as efficient therapeutic instruments for their extraordinarily ability to guide the listener through the use of mental processes that manage a change in the way reality is perceived. A typical example is that of the child who asks his parents to tell him a fairytale, because while he listens, he uses his fantasy to live the life of the characters, facing their difficulties and consequently finds in himself the resources to face eventual personal fears.
