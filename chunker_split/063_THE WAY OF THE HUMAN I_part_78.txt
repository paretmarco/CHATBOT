In Quantum Psychology, we do not try to change it, or to take the good stuff and leave the bad, and there is no "healthy" or "unhealthy." You are not your False Core or False Self Compensator. You can, however, use the False Core-False Self to describe who you imagine you are or were, realize you are not this and then discard it and discover WHO YOU A.E. Nisargadatta Maharaj said, "To discover who you are—you must first discover who you are not." Furthermore, "r would like to note here that the observer is part of the False Core and the False Self Compensator. This is why observing the False Core-False Self cannot get "you" beyond them. Ultimately, when you begin to realize that all you think you are is either the observer or the False Core-False Self and its defensive compensations, there is the realization that there is no you, which is normally termed a self, and then there only remains the non-verbal I AM or NOT-I-I (see Volume III). Knowledge of the False Core-False Self is critical because wherever your mind moves—however it moves—you take your False Core with you.
