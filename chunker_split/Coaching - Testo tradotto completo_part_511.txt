Intuition as a physiological phenomenon The concept of intuition is innately connected with the human being, and it is often so profound that it might even be watched from the outside, in non-verbal communication. It has in fact been proved that, at the time of getting a “stroke of genius”, that flash of brilliance might further be accompanied by access to different rhythms on the part of the brain waves, one capable of being measured by appropriate equipment. We might make mention in this regard of the researches quoted by Prof. Jeffrey Schwartz. Prof. Schwartz has conducted a series of researches with a view to understanding what happens to the human mind when in its processes of discovery it unveils new maps. One of the conclusions reached by that research was that, at that moment when new solutions were identified (the so-called “Eureka!” moment), at the instant, that is, when the mind opens up, it was possible to witness the development of gamma-type brain waves which coincided with the fact that many neuronal areas were then working in synchrony. It is as if the neurons functioned all together, thereby multiplying the single power.
