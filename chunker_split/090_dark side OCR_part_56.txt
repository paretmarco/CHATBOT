32 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child Age regression is a trance, understood as the basic process during which the observer moves from present time to a frozen picture of a child interacting with an adult in past time. The observer takes that past-time picture and overlays or trance-fers it on top of present time experiences. The observer sees the world through the eyes of the dark side of the inner child by overlaying what is actually occurring. Breaking this habit de-hypnotizes the observer and places the memory (picture) back in linear time. As long as the memory and the inner child are out of control, they will "pop up" on their own, outside the awareness of the adult. For example, let's say there is an observer observing a small girl in 1950. The little girl gets molested by Uncle Henry. At the time, the observer cannot understand what is occurring and feels chaos or confusion. In that chaos, the observer "freezes the action of the film," and to protect the (little girl), the observer decides, "Don't trust men or this will happen again," or "Remember this so it won't happen again."
