It depends on that faculty which is both friendly and inimical to us, on that single human faculty which goes to great lengths in complicating the problem of happiness that animals solve by the mere act of living: It depends, in other words, on Fantasy. Fantasy predates need, and oftentimes even creates it in the first place. Put it differently, we imagine ourselves to be in need of something long before we actually develop such need; we imagine to have a larger need than our real need, or else we are the ones who concoct a fictitious need. All our efforts would in that case be directed at the fulfilment of such a need. Since, however, the motivational impulse was out of proportion, we would always tend to trespass the limit. This is what having an objective is of benefit to us for: It serves the purpose of defining a limit and avoiding the possibility of surrendering to a need. The needs we have in life, as well as those we are subjected to in the world of trading, might render us vulnerable, inasmuch as we become dependent upon something.
