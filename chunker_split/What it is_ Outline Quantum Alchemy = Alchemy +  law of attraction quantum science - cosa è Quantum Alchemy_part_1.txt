Quantum Alchemy draws on the concept of alchemy linked to the law of attraction connected through quantum science interpreted in metaphorical. To get results in quantum alchemy non verbal hypnosis and body perception is the key. We try always to go to the non-verbal self that is in direct contact with the universe. We represent the paradygm of quantum alchemy with the tetraktys. Ten points. On first boottom line we have 4 points corresponding to dimensions of perception (the explicate level) that correspond both to the elements as well to different parts of the brain as in the HBDI (Hermann Brain Dominance Profile). Fire = HBDI visual i.e. Logical and focalising. Air = HBDI spatial and thinking new stuff. Water = Hbdi kynesthetical = emotions = inner feelings. Earth = Hbdi verbal = sensorial = procedural. First point corresponding to fire: for us connects to focalising reality and visual. The observer creates reality. Technique to be free: let go excessive focus looking at a mirror or using eye hypnotic fascination. This exercise brings to master you as observer. Next is the point of Air. Air is spatial conceptualizing = creating mental entities and images.
