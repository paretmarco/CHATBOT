PART 2: INSTANT RAPPORT “The ability to live magical relationships starts and finishes with you”. (W.W. Dyer) Let us continue our wonderful journey into the human potential and take a look at a new technology called “instant rapport”. A rapport is the process by which one constructs and maintains good interpersonal relations with reciprocal trust and agreement. At the same time, it is a moment of responsible and delicate consideration. Every day we find ourselves in situations in which we establish a rapport with those around us. Let us call “Instant Rapport” a technique that collects methods and useful approaches to create such a state of mind. Instant Rapport also analyzes the reasons behind why a rapport is sometimes not easy. The answer is: beliefs and attitudes limit us. The uses of “Instant Rapport” are also therapeutic, for many problems come from relationship problems. In some cases, a rapport comes spontaneously and you create a harmony, a feeling that is almost mysterious. Studies, conducted on the basis of video recordings, have shown that in reality, activated unconscious mechanisms have, at a sublimely level, created this immediate rapport.
