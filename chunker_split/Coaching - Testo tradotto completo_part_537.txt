They intersect along with the totality of life, and enable us to inject variety and harmony into our existence. They are like different colours which jointly contribute to create a unique image. Having an ideal direction If we are unaware of where to go, how can we possibly reach that point? Those who fail are the persons who do not know how to will. They lack some dominant ideal, one capable, in other words, of acting as a fulcrum for their actions. What therefore happens in their regard is a dispersion of energies: Most of such energies are dissipated in habit-driven actions, and devoured by emotions which are often unwanted. The good news, however, is that, at any given moment, we are able to take the decision of taking charge of the rudder of our ship, and that it is frequently less exhausting to steer it that way than to leaving it anchored by the harbour. Once we have elected to take that wise route, we would then have the capacity to head naturally for our ideal direction. One's ideal might be discovered through practicing our method.
