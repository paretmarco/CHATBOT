What gets formed out of this trauma, and to organize the chaos of this trauma, then, is a separate self or "I". In short, at a biological-psychological level, what you call "you" is caused by interruptions in biology due to the regulation of socialization. In this way, a trauma is a memory, a picture or an image of a past time event which emerged during shocks which caused interruptions in the BIOLOGICAL CORE. In this way, you identify or fuse with past body images. This occurs as an aspect of the nervous system. In other words, the nervous system (brain) holds memories and creates associations as a survival mechanism. 1Â° Using its searching-scanning-seeking overgeneralizing mechanism IT sees the present as the past in an attempt to insure that (something undesirable) will not happen again. Because of the natural survival mechanism of memory and creating associations, you lose awareness of your present time body and your BIOLOGICAL CORE. In short, you get further away from your body as it is and this prevents you from experiencing your BIOLOGICAL CORE which is the physical manifestation of your ESSENCE.
