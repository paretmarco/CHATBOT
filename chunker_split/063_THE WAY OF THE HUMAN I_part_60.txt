The False Self is very insidious. (One must realize that the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator is one unit and is holographic; in other words, you cannot have one without the other.) The False Core Driver always wins and always proves and re-enforces itself. For example, no matter how much you give to others to try to feel some sense of worth, deep down you always feel worthless. No matteg how much you try to prove how adequate you are through analysis, deep down you still feel inadequate. What compounds the problem is that since the spaciousness of ESSENCE was the reference point, .after the Realization of Separation trauma, you conclude that it was because of this now mislabeled spacious (Essence), which has become emptiness (which now has come to mean a lack) that the separation occurred. In short, ESSENCE is blamed for the separation. This creates a double bindâ€”avoiding and seeking ESSENCE simultaneously, because it is associated with the False Core label which mislabels the spaciousness of ESSENCE as emptiness as a lack.'
