She felt frustrated because, outside of her awareness, the dark side of the inner child was hypnotizing the present-time adult, making her believe that this was supposed to happenâ€”hence the adult in present time f'elt frustrated and angry at her partner for not taking care of her. The important thing to note is that with each style of futurizing the adult shifts from a present-time reality, to the inner-child reality that trance-fers the past to the future. In futurizing, so strong is the trance of the inner child that the adult believes the future is the past. Why do these "trances" occur? A child in a stressful situation often feels confused, overwhelmed, crazy or chaotic. In that chaos, the observer creates a fantasy that helps dissipate the feeling of chaos. For example, I was seeing a woman for therapy who, as a little girl, had to take care of her physically ill Dad. She felt trapped. Her survival mechanism was to imagine a wonderful man taking her away from all of this, thus the feelings of being overwhelmed dissipated. A gentleman I was seeing for therapy, had lived as a small boy in a poverty-stricken situation.
