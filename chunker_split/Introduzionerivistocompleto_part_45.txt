BE SIMPLE Speak to your subconscious as if it were a child; avoid “literary expressions”. Simple words have more impact. USE EMOTIONAL WORDS You need to ascertain that, at the moment of speaking, your assertions are generating sensations. The subconscious is your emotional mind. CONCENTRATE ON ACTION Your suggestions need to describe your actions, not your abilities. BE PRECISE Say exactly what it is that you want. If the result is measurable, for example your weight, be precise. BE REALISTIC Avoid suggesting perfection. PERSONALISE Suggestions are structured to change yourself and your actions, not others. “It is possible to change, just decide what type of person you want to be”. (Skipp Ross) Self-hypnosis is therefore an ideal technique both for creating new behaviours, altering others, managing problems like anxiety, tension and stress, or freeing yourself from bad habits. INDIAN SELF HYPNOSIS A characteristic of Indian self-hypnosis is that it gives a lot of importance to visualisation and projection. Indian self-hypnosis model Visualisation of the desired scene. Bring the scene towards the heart and load it with emotions. Bring the scene towards the belly button, the centre of your being. Start breathing, 6 3 6, until you feel like energy itself. Visualise a light at the root of your nose under closed eyelids. Send light to the scene. Take a deep breath, sending the scene outside and feeling that it is becoming real. Say, “thank you”.
