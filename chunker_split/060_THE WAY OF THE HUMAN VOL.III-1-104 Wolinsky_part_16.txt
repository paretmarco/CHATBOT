Step 8:Ask your False Core (and allow it to answer), "What is it that you are seeking more then anything else in the 8 Chapter 1 world." (Now, you may not get a quick response but I want you to stay with it for a little while. Get a sense of what your False Core is really seeking.) When you get a sense of what that False Core is seeking more than anything else in the world, experience that quality of ESSENCE. For example, if your False Core is seeking peace, experience the peace. )` Notice what, if anything, happens to your False Core as you go into this essential experience. From inside your ESSENCE, notice the size and shape of your False Core, as well as the BIG EMPTINESS the False Core is floating in. From inside your ESSENCE, notice the intensity of the False Core and the associational chains that it contains. Have the False Core and its associations turn around so that they can know that what they were seeking is in ESSENCE.
