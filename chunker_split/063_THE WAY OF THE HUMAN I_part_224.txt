And when the BIOLOGICAL CORE (high core and primal core) are aligned, the gravitational pull between the sun and earth occurs, hence, there are no interruptions, and the Tao is naturally realized.. In this way, when your biological connection is aligned between the sun and the earth, you just are. This is the Tao (way). There is no psychology because there are no breakages or interruptions' in the BIOLOGICAL CORE. There are no past, present, or projected future body images. There is not even a present time body image. Rather, you just are on a biological level. To appreciate this, according to Rolf, we must understand that the interruptions (breakages) in this "gravitational" connection and alignment between sun and earth create psychology. This breakage creates a subjective biological experience of separation-merger, which is ultimately imaginary. This separation-merger response is noticed by psychology's idea (thinking dimension) and underlies many psychological processes. Psychology is then formed as an abstraction, a resistance, a way to explain pain, stress, shock or in a word, chaos, to explain this natural separation-merger experience.
