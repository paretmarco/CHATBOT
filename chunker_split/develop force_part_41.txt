In the absence of a necklace, you can practice to count, in the manner above described, dried beans, hazelnuts, etc. Exercise 12. Thumbs. Sit, cross your fingers and start shooting right thumb on the left with isochronous. The exercise consists in keep your mind focused on what you are doing without ever diverting it. Gradually prolong the duration of the exercise. Exercise 13. Fists closed. Sit; put closed fists on the table. Then open a finger at a time really slowly, giving attention on the motion of your finger. Open one after the other the fingers of a hand first, then the fingers of the other hand; then the homonymous fingers of both hands: e.g. the two indices, the two medium, the two rings, etc. We repeat again: in this, as in all others, the exercise is not to make the movement indicated, but forcing thought to follow the movement without any interruption whatsoever, in order to train the mind to an increasingly long concentration on a particular subject. Exercise 14. Clapping. Beat the palms against each other rhythmically during an increasingly long time; or counting the number of times. The mind has meanwhile to think only to that movement performed by your hands. Exercise 15. Steps. Walk regularly for five steps, providing you have in your brain the feel that you move forward the right foot, then the left.
