In order for this activity to take place in a perfect form, it is however a necessary precondition that our mind should know where to head for when we find ourselves in life’s varied circumstances. The other prerequisite consists, therefore, in predetermination, since it is this which establishes the logical concatenation, the sequence of operations leading to the attainment of a given result. The predetermined action must be carried out perfectly and fully in the knowledge that our body functions, as if in a somnambulistic state, via automatic acts, and by resorting as less as possible to the use of the brain’s higher centres, the operation of which will subsist purely at the level of external control. That is something achievable, though with difficulty, even in respect of intellectual works. After all, the inspiration felt by poets and artists is a form of automatism or, to put it in even better terms, a form of cerebral unconscious, whereby a split occurs: The subject falls so to speak into a state of trance, while the spirit acts independently of any volitional force.
