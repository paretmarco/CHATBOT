The Thunderbolt appears to be the symbol of God Jupiter, and the Owl (sacred to Athena and Minerva) must have been inserted as a symbol of the Goddess Venus, since Venus is not considered as a protector towards fascination, while Minerva was always a patron deity and carried on her shield Medusaâ€™s head. The serpent was a symbol of Hecate, one of the attributes of Diana Triformis and considered one of hers most powerful antidotes. Here we assume that the symbol was adopted as applicable to Dies Saturnii (226). Similarly, in this ancient gem the eye appears surrounded by four symbols that can refer to elements and in any case to highest deities. Observing this amulet, we think it was of Gnostic nature, and its origin was a Greek-Egyptian, although created subsequently. Then each symbol has to be interpreted as Egyptian from the Greek point of view. As we know from Pliny (note 227) there were not deer in Africa, it is clear that whoever created this amulet must have denoted with the deer a deity of the Greek-Roman mythology; and we must therefore ask ourselves which prototype existed in Egypt whose attributes were the same of Diana of Ephesus. This may not be other than Hathor, Goddess of Moon (228). And the thunderbolt can represent Serapis, a Sun God. Therefore, each of the symbols represented solves as the Sun or the Moon. Is a sculpted Onyx (223) by Gerhard's collection, with a central eye and at sides the head of Serapis, the Eagle, the Thunderbolt, and the Dolphin.
