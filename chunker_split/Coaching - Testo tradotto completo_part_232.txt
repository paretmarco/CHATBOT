In essence, in conformity with what we can easily observe in respect of the periods of our life we have spent in a state of relatively immutable conditions, which are then suddenly followed by uncertainty, we shall limit ourselves to laying out a plan for one such period. This period might extend to a single year or it might encompass a 10 years' span. Even in the latter case, it would still be convenient to divide the plan into a number of segments, and thus articulate it as a series of minor plans. The ideal time unit shall often consist in one year. We might then sub-divide the annual plan into 12 monthly plans, each one of them being subdivided in turn into weekly and— lastly — daily plans. As we shall see here under, there is, between those who work according to this system and the people who work without any system, the same difference that exists between the person who walks on an open road and the individual who is forced to wriggle his way through a pathless forest.
