Before man acquired logical capacity, in fact, some other mechanism to regulate acceptance or rejection of ideas must have been in existence. It is legitimately conceivable that a person used to communicate an idea which was deemed likeable and which conformed to certain principles would experience the acceptance of that. The basic emotions which regulate the mechanisms of fascination are the same ones underlining acceptance of other people's words. Additional Notes on the processes of Fascination The processes of fascination belong to the deepest area of the brain. Let us now proceed to examine the various layers thereof, escorting such examination with the presentation of additional recommendations.
