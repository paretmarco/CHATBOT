to deal with a dimension where it is possible to attain substantial results “beyond physical reality”, such as, for instance, distance healing, as well as coincidences, those unexpected facts which allow us to progress at supersonic speed towards the goal we have set out for, or even towards completely new goals we had never even imagined before. It is as if, within the time of “kairòs”, man, by establishing a link with reality, “moved beyond” and thereby arrived at a dimension no longer capable of being expressed at the level of the physical time-space reality. The kairòs in fact corresponds to an expansion of the consciousness and a greater extent of comprehensiveness. Kairòs is a time of energetic attention to the now. The development of such a state might likewise be rendered smoother by implementing specific exercises which “allow a better” and more complete “functioning” of the brain. In the eyes of quantum mechanics, states of elevated cerebral coherence are related to the possible occurrence of “non-local” effects, that is to say, effects which no longer fall within the traditional categories of cause ? effect 49. ?
