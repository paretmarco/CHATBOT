When walking into someoneâ€™s presence: If you walk inside an office so as to approach a man sitting by his desk, look at him well in his face as soon as he raises his eyes in order to welcome you. He must cross your look at the time when the latter is already fixed upon his person. By doing as instructed, you shall produce a very powerful effect of surprise. Remember also that, once the conversation with him has begun, one of the golden rules is to limit your selves to talk about those issues which might be of interest to him. If you happen to be contradicted regarding what you are saying, avoid getting scandalized, especially if the individual who is refuting what you are saying is in the right. In the event that you believe yourselves to be in the right, it will be necessary to courteously adduce some arguments which might cause them to think over your points. An even more pressing requirement is never to adopt a triumphant attitude when you have succeeded in persuading them.
