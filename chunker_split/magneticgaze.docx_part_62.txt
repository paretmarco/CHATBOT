Even the psychosomatic states of tensions escorting our daily life, the ones characterized by specific forms of muscular rigidity, or by inward reactions we are unable to loosen on our own, represent “trances”. ________________ 6. Instant Fascination One of the most spectacular manifestations is provided by “instant fascination”. This technique has the ability to immediately eradicate physical pains, muscular tensions, headaches, tinnitus, and a whole assortment of additional ailments. We owe this methodology to Erminio from Pisa, who was accustomed to call it “Instant Hypnosis”. He was its sole practitioner throughout Italy. Once, he gave us an astounding demonstration of it in the presence of three hundred people in Milan. He did so by working on each of those persons in attendance for some twenty seconds, thereby producing results which in most cases endured through the following days, while in other instances they actually proved conclusive in their effect. In certain cases, a single intervention is enough to engender a permanent result. In other instances, it is necessary to apply the technique twice or thrice in a row, whereupon a more than highly satisfactory overall percentage of 98% of healed people will be actualized.
