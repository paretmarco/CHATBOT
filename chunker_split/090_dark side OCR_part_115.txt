For de-hypnosis to occur the observer, who has been asleep, must wake-up and take responsibility for this internal conflict. As an example, the rebel (resisting Dad) identity called "I want to be me," will imagine, experience, or expect someone in authority to give her a hard time. It appears as though the person is attempting to be herself, while the inner child is actually reacting to a trans- ferred image of Mom or Dad. Stated another way, the fused Father is projected or trance-(erred. The rebel (I want to be me) identity stays inside or vice versa. This explains why many people automati- cally assume that authority figures will push them around and they begin to fight them before that actually occurs. How does this apply to self-talk? The child becomes the Father by duplicating the father' s voice through a series of interactions with Father; the child identifies and fuses, through verbal dialogue, or non-verbal body posture, his looks, expressions, feelings and even tapes of the father's voice. If the child chooses to resist his father, he reflects a rebel identity.
