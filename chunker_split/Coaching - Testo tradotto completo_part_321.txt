There is a ladder which can take a person to the acquisition of such capacity. In the earlier stages, it will be easy to firstly organize, in terms of this modus operandi, those actions lacking an intrinsic value, and which serve as means rather than being an end in their own selves. Such actions encompass all the acts of oneâ€™s vegetative life, all the individual acts which are necessary requirements for sustaining one's existence, as well as the acts aimed at securing social conservation (the whole array of pleasantries and polite etiquettes, customs and traditions, prevailing fashion, etc). Instead of struggling each time to resolve on what to do, it will be enough to just let our bodily machine carry them out, and then, once they have been arranged beforehand, to entrust control over such acts to the unconscious mind, whereupon we might comfortably limit ourselves to the role of observers of all of that.
