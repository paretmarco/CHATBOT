The Universe contains everything and man is the soul of the universe The human body is both a way to feed the universal energy and at the same time it shows itself as a way of manifesting of the energy The basic equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is Schrodinger's Wave Equation [2]: 2 2 i h (p)Q /(p)t = - h /2m Delta Q + V(x,y,z) Q satisfying the normalizing condition: Integral 2 over all |Q| dx dy dx = 1 space where: h = 6.63E-34 joule sec / (2 pi) pi = 3.14... V(x,y,z) = Potential energy, as a function of coordinates x, y and z m = Mass t = Time (p) = Partial derivative of 2 Q = Wave function of the particle, where Q dx dy dz is the probability that the particle may be found in the volume element dx dy dz at a particular time. Values of Q are components of the "state vector." 859 Values of Q are quantum mechanically defined states and constitute components of the "state vector."
