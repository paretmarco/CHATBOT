This is not to say that these ideas represent ultimate truth, that alternative theories no not exist, or that flaws will not be found and that alternative theories will not replace them. I would welcome hearing from others who have additional information and insight into the applicability and limitations of the theories of modern Physics as applied to the occult. MULTIPLE UNIVERSES? One interesting hypothesis is that of multiple universes. As I understand it, this hypothesis states that all of the alternative possibilities allowed by quantum mechanics actually occur, but in different universes. Magicians can interpret their magic as moving their awareness between these alternative universes. I have never seen the multiple universe theory set up mathematically in a way that would allow it to be quantitatively tested, using physical measurements (like was done with Mr. Walker's theory), It would be interesting to determine if and to what extent the multiple universe hypothesis can be integrated with Mr. Walker's theory. Consciousness, acting at a gross level, seems to be relativistic - something experienced by observers relative to their frames of reference. Consciousness, at its ultimate level, seems to be subtler than time and location.
