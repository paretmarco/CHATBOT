TYPE 9 (PEACEMAKER) Let me take part!!!!!!!!!!!!! As well as being able to recognize ourselves in one of the nine different enneagram types, the enneagram can also be used as a communication tool. ENNEAGRAM FOR COMMUNICATING The first thing we should do is OBSERVE our interlocutor in all of his/ her behaviors to be able to identify the enneagram type s/he belongs to. This allows us to understand the reasons behind his/ her behavior and eventual difficulties that we may meet, allowing us to pull out his/ her values. Thus, we can enter into a rapport without risk of doing or saying anything that makes us go on a “collision course”. It is, therefore, evident that the enneagram can be used both on personal and professional levels.
