An education which fails to open itself up to the secret of power and its successful deployment, an education which refrains from teaching the immutable laws that govern the power of persuasive communication, is surely incomplete. What is going to follow now is an introduction to the knowledge of the dynamics of Persuasion as linked to the dynamics of Fascination, and to the knowledge of how a person can at all times activate the deep mechanisms of the reptilian brain. Three are the processes by which we generally impact on our fellow humans. Firstly, they are influenced by the use of the hands and by gestures; secondly, they are influenced by the use of the eyes; and thirdly, they are influenced by suggestions which one extends to them or by the content of what one is speaking about. Independently of such three ways, your intention and mental concentration will always represent essential components in the picture. It is, in fact, as if there was an invisible influence which simultaneously consists in a subtle emanation from a strong will to power and in a form of general impression which is produced by the combined effect of the three abovementioned processes.
