Another frequent occurrence which psychologists have noticed is, for example, the fact than an anorexic person does not perceive herself to be what she is, and in fact, even when she is in front of a mirror, she has the impression of being fat. These are but a few illustrations from the numerous examples of how imagination pervades everyday life, whereupon we do not perceive reality but only our personal image thereof. Exactly as in the example we have mentioned earlier of the nocturnal traveller who saw the trees as being dangerous persons ready to assail him, there might be the human type who sees any person he meets as a danger. This person, therefore, is not perceiving reality: He is perceiving his own image of reality. Every person, as he wakes up in the morning, is convinced that he is awake. The truth is however different. It is the fact that imagination mixes with our mental mechanisms that keeps us in a state which is as if a dreamy one, and in which we only discern what we want to see. Most people are captured by their own mental mechanisms, their own pensive reflections, and the inner atmosphere of incessant self-talk.
