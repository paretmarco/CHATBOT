How many times we are in fact unable to carry out what we would like to do? How much are we really present to our own selves in the course of a single day? How many times is our mind burrowed by thoughts or ideas which are neither desired nor useful? On how many occasions do we fail to be truly our own selves? In actual fact, human freedom (the so-called free will) does exist, and yet is extremely circumscribed. Usually, man is in essence ir-responsible until and unless he becomes conscious of what he does. The key to every thing, to be able to "ride one’s destiny”, lies in being conscious. That entails having consciousness of one’s own being. A first essential step along this path is learning to remove useless thoughts, as we explained before. In taking such a first step, we will achieve a lot, since we will shelve aside part of what encumbers us. Once we have removed thoughts, in fact, all that is then left is our own selves. Wanting to travel on this path of re-integration carries the meaning of naturally acquiring a higher degree of self-mastery and power over the different situations.
