An observer who creates a child identity which tries and fails at a task several times and hears Dad say, "This is how you do it," can "become" or fuse with the Dad and decide, "I'll be Daddy, and it will all work out." Of course, they begin to be so much like Daddy, they can lose themselves. If the child resists Daddy, (rebellious boy), fusion takes place. The experience becomes "always fighting father." This creates Principle II: When a fused identity is resisted, the resisting identity (rebellious boy) must be formed to protect the individual from the fused identity, namely Dad. "I must resist Dad" gets created. This appears as the only way an individual can survive. Now you have two inner-child identities fighting one another. One is called "I' m like Dad," the other "I want to be me" (rebellious boy). This is experienced as an internal conflict. These two oppos- ing inner-child identities keep the conflict in place.
