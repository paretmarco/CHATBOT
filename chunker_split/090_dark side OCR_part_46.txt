This experience of being "stuck" in a past place or point in one' s personal history is the inner child' s stuckness, not the present-time adult. This is why, as an adult, you say, feel, or react in certain ways out of your control and don't understand why. You relate to the world through the inner child identity, which creates the parameters for future interpersonal limitation. In other words, seeing our present-time relationship through the past-time window of the inner child limits our view, resources, emotional parameters, and our decisions. Let' s take an example of a mother who wants her child to "please her." Asking a child to please Mom in order to get love, attention, and approval can be more traumatic for the child than Age Regression + 27 might normally be appreciated. Asking a child to give up what they want, or even to "give-up themselves" to please Mom, and hence survive, is asking a child to give up an internal need. In the confusion and chaos of determining how to survive, the observer creates a pleasing-child identity.
