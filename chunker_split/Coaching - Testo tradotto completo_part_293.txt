We simply “know” that at an inner level, we know it motion-wise. Pre-visualization might be of benefit at the beginning of our process to develop presentification. At a later stage, however, we will have to establish contact with the deepest nuclei of the mind. It is important, for the sake of exploiting such force, to understand the following psychological truth: The will is a power which is linked to the “taste” of what we accomplish. Put it in different terms: A particular reason turns into an energy component, and as such into an originator of actual efforts, when an element of “taste” becomes superimposed on it, with the result that the personality of the individual concerned is grabbed and struck by it. In the same way that an animal will head towards the food with a foreknowledge of its taste, we will be more effective in moving in one direction whenever we possess a more direct sensory perception of the “taste” of what we are going to attain. The techniques we are about to present here will lead you to fully experience the taste and wonder of life.
