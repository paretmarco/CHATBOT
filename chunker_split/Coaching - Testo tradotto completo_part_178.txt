The only true distinguisher lies in the fact that, whereas the arena where the former class of people, the men of thought, is located, is in their own beings, the stage where men of action act exists externally to their selves. The achievers “There is no propitious wind for the one who lacks acquaintance with where he should head for” (Seneca) The advocates of the theory of the “state of flux”, i.e. that stage wherein to work becomes easy and a person manages to accomplish the highest possible level of results, have noticed that, in most instances, these fortunate individuals are “self-directing”, meaning that they have objectives which conform to their selves, to their own essential inward being. Understanding the initial impulse “Wherever there is a will there is a way” (Guillaume d’ Orange) The achievers are those who have stability in their life direction. Every man who makes a sufficient attempt at searching possesses a natural ability to make existential choices. He spontaneously possesses an array of capacities for self-orientation. This innate talent, which one detects in such variety of human beings, has its origin in the relationship with the Universe which people like them have.
