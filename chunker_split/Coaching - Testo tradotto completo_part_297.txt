In that respect it is set aside from pre-ideation, which consists, on the other hand, in an act carried out by the reason. It goes beyond mere daydreaming, dreaming that is in a wakeful state. Every one of us has had at some point the experience of dreaming that he found himself in a particular state. The sheer, stark image of our self being catapulted into the future has hardly ever induced us to deviate from our set path. If, however, a dream — by answering our subjective impulses and needs — has managed to strike the intimate chords of our being –, has actually managed, that is, to reach into the cerebellum, into the nerve centres of all our motions, then our activity will have undergone a change in direction, and we will have arranged in advance, predetermined, whatever we needed so as to accomplish it within a demarcated period of time. Accordingly, after we have arranged and determined beforehand whatever action is becoming of us in the situation, we ought to arouse in us the desire and the reality of this activity through the medium of presentification.
