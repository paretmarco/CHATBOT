The couple had paired up with one another, asking each other, "From where does that thought arise?" The woman stopped her inquiring, looked at me, and said "I'm trying to think of something to sayâ€”I'm always trying to think of something to say." I replied, "That's the story of your life," and she answered, "Yes." That thought "I should say something" wont by and she identified it as herself. She would then run all her trips about how and why she never knew what she should say. So as thoughts arise, keep asking yourself, "From where does that thought arise'?" If there is a thought called "I'm afraid," you identified with it and feel like "That's me." Then suddenly your mind said, "I'm afraid because I don't have enough money." "I'm fearful because my relationship is screwed up," "I afraid because (fill in the blank)."
