Rather than the Ku Klux Klan acknowledging the chaos they feel around African-Americans (which would require feeling vulnerable), they express defensive displaced anger. Truly, groups like the KKK are cowards. Why? Because they hide behind sheets and travel in groups. To paraphrase Malcolm X, you never see one unsheeted member of the KKK trying to fight one black man—they need many. This is because they feel vulnerable and chaotic and they are afraid and unwilling to take responsibility for their own experience of that, hence, a deep survival trance of resisting the experience of differences-4vulnerability—i.anger. It is crucial to understand and identify the collapsing of the levels which keeps trance-ference alive. This helps us out of our automatic behavior and into present-time reality. Furthermore, without the knowledge of trance-ference, the process of spiritualization, whereby we trance-fer our divinity and power onto others, cannot be ended. Therefore, in order to follow The Way of the Human, we must first know our trances and identities and examine them and take them apart before we can move into and stabilize in multi-dimensional awareness.
