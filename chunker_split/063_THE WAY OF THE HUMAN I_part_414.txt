Men often abandon women who held the rope for them, i.e., women who held them together so that they could succeed. After abandoning this integration they become separate again by abandoning the feminine. Theseus heads for Athens. But because of his killing of his own sexuality becoming separate and abandoning his feminine, he becomes unconscious (amnesic) and forgets to change the black sails to white. In other words, because he has separated and destroyed his sexuality, he goes into a trance. This also means that the evil mission of dividing and separating sexuality from the whole mind has been successful and he is flying black, the color of the "evil" separation. The sails are kept black also symbolizing his death (greater separation) and, hence, the black or dark forces have wonâ€”dark being the separating forces, light or white, the revealing forces. His father (Mr. Separateness) sees the black sails on the ship from a mountaintop.
