From our perusal of all the abovementioned plans and our critical analysis of the day we have just spent, we would have extracted certain annotations which are now required to be weighed up with a sagacious eye, either by discarding something or by adding one element, and especially by allocating every action where it belongs, to its appropriate time, i.e., the precise place and moment where the implementation thereof might prove to be easier, readier, and more certain to occur. In order for orderly formulation to be facilitated, we have imagined a format which every one of us is able to draw up for himself. A nice aid consists, in fact, in forcing yourselves to jot down in writing your views on a particular issue. The act of writing prevents the occurrence of mental dispersion: Seeing the result of oneâ€™s reflective thinking concretely embodied on paper obliges one to fix his attention upon the relevant subject matter. Writing ? First concrete embodiment We are now going to supply you with two possible variants on how to prepare the plan, namely, a simplified version and a comprehensive one.
