To illustrate the difficulty of this, let's say I meet someone who reminds me of someone I once knew. "I" begin to relate to "my" internal memory and go "self' to "self," in the process losing my sense of present time reality. In other words, (as mentioned in Trances People Live), I go into a trance. I lose the external NOW and present time reality. This problem of going self to self can be seen when I say that "you remind me of (fill in the blank)" or "this (situation, event, therapy, etc.,) is just like (fill in the blank)." The tendency to imagine that the present time is the same as the past is a generalizing survival function of the nervous system, and in Quantum Psychology we call this process the Associational Trance. The Associational Trance occurs when the scanning and searching device of the nervous system generalizes automatically in order to maintain its survival by assuming that the past is exactly like the present. "You" are no longer able to see differences between people, situations, or events.
