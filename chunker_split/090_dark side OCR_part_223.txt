Notice how the inner child within the adult will be attracted to philosophies that keep the trance alive and well. We must understand that the path feels right to the inner child, because it is Tamil-iar, similar to the family/ child trance. Adult Problem State: Family and spiritual rejection. In every spiritual group, I have encountered people who feel finished or who aren't following the path (game) any longer. They are harassed by the other family/spiritual members. When a child leaves home in a dysfunctional family, the parents and other family members send the message, "There's something wrong with that boy/girl," or, "They are doing it the wrong way and will fail." It is an Spiritualizing + 139 interesting parallel in spiritual groups. When a member wants to leaveâ€”outgrows the group or feels finished the group says, "He/shefell from the path, didn't really surren- der, was resisting, or had some worldly stuff to work out." The spiritualization of the dysfunctional family parallels the spiritual group. Adult Problem State: I am entitled.
