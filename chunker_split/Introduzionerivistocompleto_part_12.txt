Provatela , se funziona tenetela , se non funziona buttatela via, e questo sarebbe un atteggiamento piennellistico!!!!!!!! IT’S NOT IMPORTANT FROM WHERE YOU BEGIN. WHAT COUNTS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO ARRIVE. THE ONLY HURDLE IN ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES IS THE IDEA OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THERE.......YOUR MIND IS A DISASTER, CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU WILL GET IT!!!!!!!! However, remember that it is not enough to think about what it is that you would like to obtain; you need to visualize, believe in yourself and above all, make sure that it really is what you want. Avoid wasting energy passing from one thought to another, limiting yourself to dreaming about what will happen. We can live our dreams and this happens when we really concentrate on realizing our objectives or when we want to change certain aspects of our life which we do not like. “Concentration is like a laser beam that can pass through any obstacle”. (Anthony Robbins) Many people do not manage to get what they want, simply because they do not focus their attention on a single aspect but grope around in their minds from one thought to another. “There is only one part of the Universe that you can be sure to improve and that part is you!” (Aldus Huxley) Towards the end of this book some NLP techniques are reported for various aims. NLP & NLP 3 NLP 3 represents a step up in knowledge from NPL.
