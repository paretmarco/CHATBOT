In the process, we also integrate the so-called "luxmind (c)" by observing a light from a light bulb that blocks central vision and creates a state of mental block (think that even animals can get stuck by a light) by exploiting this block to insert ideas into the mind with a mantra-style system. Then, by closing the eyes and observing the residual image of the light, a fixation point is created and the hypnotic process continues without further speaking. This method is as if it opens the mind to lateral thinking since it blocks the central field. New ideas appear. There is certainly also an effect of the light that metaphorically is similar to an implied level as intended by Bohm that becomes explicit when it reaches the objects and reduces. In addition to quantum physics and hypnosis, Quantum Psi (c) is also based on the principles of alchemy, an ancient spiritual practice that seeks to achieve transformation and enlightenment through the use of symbolic elements and processes.
