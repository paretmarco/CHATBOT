It is my view that each person transfers elements of the parents' child care to his own handling of himself as an object (p. 59) (and, hence, observes him or herself through the eyes of Mom and Dad). In other words, how your parents treated and observed you as a child will be internalized and you will treat and observe "yourself' (actually an age regressed you) the same way they did. I have worked with innumerable people who "beat themselves up" for behaving a certain way. In every situation, the client had an "internalized parent identity" and a "beaten child identity." They internalized a parent who was abusive, and then abused themselves. An ESSENCE or I AM prior to taking on Identities never beats themselves up. To repeat, "You will do unto yourself that which was done unto you." In the above situation, the infant identifies with the beaten child identity and the abusive parent. The internalized parent then beats up the internalized child.
