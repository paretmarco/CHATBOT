One is, if I can just understand it, the chaos will be organized. Two, if I find out what I did wrong, I can control it so that it will never happen again. Three, if I make or do it right this time, it won't happen again. In short, it is a resistance to what has occurred, and an associational tendency used as a survival mechanism. The tendency is if I could just understand this (fill in the blank), then somehow the chaos would disappear. In a short time the desire to understand becomes a defense against experiencing and not knowing, and is often the impetus and drive to type, characterize and diagnose people. Unfortunately, in psychology, they are dealing with stories and trying to get people to understand their stories. Then, in psychology the work often becomes to create (new) stories about the stories. Accumulating information, refraining, creating new stories about the stories, future pacing (the trance of futurizing)â€”all of this keeps the associational trance alive with the belief that if I do (fill in the blank), this will or will not happen again.
