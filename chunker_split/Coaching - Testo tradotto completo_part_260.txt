According to this vision of things, the only existing desire is the logical, active desire which is on its way to actualization. It is, in other words, the knowledge that a certain thing becomes actualized, whereupon we set the organism in motion. An unreal or impossible desire is, for that very reason, a lifeless desire, one which is divested of dynamic virtue. I do not desire to go to the moon. The desires which, at this stage, fall outside my reach leave me unmoved. In conclusion, it must be stressed that joy does not lie in things, but in organic receptiveness and in our capacity to be heedful to whatever exists in the moment. This is what grants access to true happiness, which is more than the mere sum- total of pleasures. It is in fact a general organic condition, a disposition to experientially feel pleasure, a sensibility which is orientated towards pleasure, and a spiritual mood which derives enjoyment from all of that. It is nature enjoying its own self, and leading therefore to the pleasure ensconced in the now, as well as in becoming impassive to pain.
