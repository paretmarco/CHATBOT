When awareness of all of these eight dimensions are included and their functions understood, we can experience our full humanity. Briefly these eight dimensions are: One, the external world; two, the thinking world; three, the emotional world; four, the biological or animal dimension; five, ES- 3 The Way of the Human® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness SENCE; six, the no-state state of I AM; seven, Archetypes of the COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS; and eight, the "NOT-I-I." How are some problems created? Unfortunately, our awareness of the different functions of these dimensions get confused. When this occurs, we confuse one dimension's function with another dimension's function. This causes confusion and pain. For example, attempts to change the thinking or emotional dimensions—i.e., ing to make them more unconditionally loving, compassionate, and forgiving—confuses the functions of these dimensions. In the above example, unconditional love or compassion are not qualities of the biological animal, thinking or emotional dimensions. Rather, these are the qualities of ESSENCE. Therefore, we must understand the different dimensions of consciousness and their functions.
