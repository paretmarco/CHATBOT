The parents make suggestions like "You're not going to make it," "Please me and I'll please you," or "Do what I say and give you love and approval; don't and I won't." The child (subject) goes into a trance, a state of absorption, and believes the suggestions that the hypnotists (parents) make. The child then internalizes these sugges- tions and continues to suggest them as a grown adult. This is the dark side of the inner child, the inner child of the past hypnotizing the present time adult into problem states. As years go on, perhaps a teacher or another authority figure merely mentions the similar suggestion (induction), and the subject (student) goes into the same "fear" trance that happened as a child. Time goes on. The child matures, enters into relationships, and marries. Then the spouse can become the hypnotist, putting the inner child of their spouse in an anger trance or a fear of rejection trance. Once the suggestions are made and the individual moves into a trance, the subject's autonomy as a free being behind these trance states is lost.
