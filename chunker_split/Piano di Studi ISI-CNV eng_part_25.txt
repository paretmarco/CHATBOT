NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) is a technique very diffused today for change and improvement of communication skills and NLP3 is a further development of NLP toward quantum thinking, called NLP 3. NLP3 is based on many experiments and also on integration of not verbal technology. Each technique explained has been practiced and tested hundreds of times with success. It is a very efficient way of thinking and operating going beyond the paths of mainstream NLP. While for example in NLP we have the word “linguistic”, in NLP3 we put much more emphasis on non verbal behaviour as this is a fundamental key for the efficacy of our discipline. While in traditional NLP we have the word “programming”, NLP3 has the goal to pave the way to the “quantum thinking” that it is completely different from programming. In Quantum thinking the mind is free. • If you are an NLPer, this is your occasion of learning something new that will further enhance your efficacy. • If you are new, you will start with the right foot. Most of the most successful teachers and practitioners use, at least unconsciously, many elements written in this book. Personally we find this methodology simpler in application than the old ones. In our centres we train psychotherapists and hypnotherapists, and we practise as well personal therapies, coaching etc… This is as a new discipline based on recent researches and on the successes we have got. Please, throw away all your past mental conditioning and open your mind to new frames of thinking: what you find here is the result of our experience!
