If you were to enquire from many people as to how they have attained success, they would reply to you that “they had been blessed with luck”, and that life’s circumstances had enabled them to give expression to their own inspiration. In actual fact, these persons set out from an inward impulse, from some force which is created out of their subjective interaction with the Universe. Ultimately, the Universe is what they actually give effect to. It is this force, this energy, which confers stability even on their life plan, and which enables them to persevere amid difficulties and through them. Resort to this kind of force is normally escorted by a feeling of satisfaction, and by a resolute desire to enjoy life with regard to every thing it has to offer. Success and happiness are always in front of us. All we need is learning how to stir into motion our vital energy, and how to steer it in the right direction, in order to enable it to yield positive results. The Universe is no more than a response structure. It is commensurately with the way in which we interact with the Universe that whatever we wrest from it emerges into existence. We are able therefore to extract results, provided we adopt the right posture. Creating and Steering energy.
