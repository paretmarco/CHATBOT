Exercise 35 – Relaxing Relax deeply and then let one part of your beings, the “clearer” part, surface. Imagine yourselves being able to climb as if inside your selves. If, in the darkness of your eyelids, you feel as if you perceive some glows of light which emerge within your mental space, focus thereon your attention, particularly in the region of the third eye or the top of your skull. You will then notice that the luminous glow is going to increase. At that stage, allow the emergence of some words which supply an answer to the question: “What is important for me to accomplish?”; “What should be done?”. Some concepts, some ideas, will come into your view. Record them in writing. For many people, it is easier to implement this exercise if they are led through it.

Do not however let yourselves be deceived by words.
