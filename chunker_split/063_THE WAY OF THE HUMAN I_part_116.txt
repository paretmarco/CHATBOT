For example, if you place your attention solely on an object, then you are using one-dimensional awareness. When "you" split awareness, dividing it half inward (noticing your thinking process) and half outward, "you" are exhibiting two-dimensional awareness. If "you" split attention 1/3 outward, 1/3 on thinking and 1/3 on your emotional dimension, you are exhibiting three-dimensional awareness. If "YOU" split attention 1/4 outward, 1/4 on thinking, 1/4 on your emotional nature, and 1/4 biologically, "you begin to enter into ESSENCE-I AM-or-NOT-I-I" which is beyond the observer-observed dyad. Then "you" are experiencing four-dimensional awareness. The next step is when awareness is split 1/5 on the external world, 1/5 on the thinking, 1/5 on the emotional process, 1/5 on your animal nature, and 1/5 on the ESSENCE. Finally, we go beyond into the I AM and eventually into the "NOT-H", which is not observingâ€”but WITNESSING the observer-observed dyad while being aware of the VOID and as pure awareness. 64 Chapter 1V The question then emerges: "How do we become aware of and maintain all of these dimensions simultaneously?" This next section deals with just this issue.
