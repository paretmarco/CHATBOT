Whenever anything comes into your awareness, the question will be asked of you by a partner, "Who told you that?" and the answer is, "The mind." The only way you could possibly know what you are feeling or experiencing is if the voice in the back of your head says, "I'm happy" or "I'm sad"or whatever. A student asked, "Why is it the mind?" I replied, "Because it's made of thoughts. Thoughts that are identified with, become my thoughts. So, really, it's the mind and the thoughts. Also, for the seeding for future understanding, there is only one mind, not many minds (to be discussed in Volume III). Practice: I'd like you to sit for about seven to ten minutes and notice each thought as it comes through your awareness. Say to yourself, "Who told you that?" Then answer, "The mind." The aim is to not identify with anything that comes through your mind. There's a book by a woman saint, Ananda Mayi Ma, who died about 1980.
