Some people have indeed contended that each one of us churns out fifty-thousand thoughts on a daily basis. Every one of those thoughts that we formulate influences us, and alters our mental images as well as our peculiar perception of reality. What would happen, moreover, if these thoughts are negative? The reality is that a subject who is worried is less aware of the surrounding environment. Even if positive elements are found in it, he is often oblivious to their existence. He is in a state of “trance with his own self”, immersed in what might be described as an "intrapersonal trance", a trance, that is, which is internal to his own person (intra = inside). It is as if this state interposed itself between his person and the environment in which he moves. In an essential way, such interposing trance acts like a veiling cloak, with the result that he does not directly react to the environment, but rather filters its input and finally responds to it on the strength of models he has learnt in the past.
