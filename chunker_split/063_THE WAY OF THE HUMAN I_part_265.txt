But you cannot do that if you don't have a container, i.e., the body. If you don't have a container to contain your sensation, you cannot build enough charge to explode and go beyond. In other words, if you dissociate from sensation or dribble it out through mushy boundaries whenever the energetic charge increases, you automatically lose it or it dissipates. When this happens, there is no container from which to explode out. You need to be able to have a container (body) and contain and hold sensation without labeling it. ________________ Chapter VIII QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Stories and explanations come out of the resistance to having sensations within a container (the body) and accepting them as they are. The nervous system has an automatic abstracting process. It immediately labels and goes into thoughts and justifications during which you move further and further away from the non-verbal experience. If I am notwilling to contain and have my sensations, then I cannot be grounded in the biological dimension and it would be difficult to walk around in life and experience ESSENCE or I AM.
