By this identity structure that believes, "I have to give her energy so that she gives me energy so this identity exists to resist nonexistence," how has the mother identity (you have an identity here called the little girl, and the little girl gives energy to mom so that mom will give energy back to the little girl so the little girl feels like she exists so that she doesn't have to feel her concept of nonexistence)â€”how does this structure seem to you now? Ridiculous. How big is this structure to you now? Therapeutic Note It is a hot issue because her mother died so recently. I want to go through several of the concepts to help her experience things as they are as opposed to through the lens of distorted concepts. For example, this idea about death. Wolinsky:If you fuse together death equals final, what are you creating? Therapeutic Note From a Quantum perspective, there is no birth or death. The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condenses down and forms objects, people, thoughts, etc., and we call that life. The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS thins-out and becomes VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS again and we call that death.
