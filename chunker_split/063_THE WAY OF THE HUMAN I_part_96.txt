But the symbol of safety would only re-enforce the holographic nature and defense against the trauma since it was created by a "little girl" as a way of defending against a trauma and was part of the trauma itself. If a guru has thousands of disciples, oftentimes they all get the same or similar mantras, or they all get the same or similar spiritual practice, as opposed to, "This is for you, you need this," and "This other one needs that." That requires very specific instruction. I think part of the problem is that psycho-spirituality has become a business. If a teacher refers you out to somebody else, the teacher loses dollars. That's the hard fact. Therapy, self-work, and psycho-spirituality are no longer student- or client-centered but therapistguru-teacher- centered. The teacher needs the student as opposed to, "What does this particular individual student need?" Another problem is that people involved in psycho-spirituality rarely question their own underlying assumptions and the assumptions on which the system they are involved in is based. When I was with Nisargadatta Maharaj, he often asked people to leave within a few minutes.
