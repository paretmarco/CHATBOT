In order for their symptom to remain, they have to fog-out the world as they did as children. This symptom can emerge as an auditory blocking-out, a visual blocking-out, a kinesthetic blocking-out (sensory distortion), or a not knowing blocking-out (amnesia/ denial). The important element is recognizing you do NOT see, know, feel, or hear what' s occurring. In cases of drug and alcohol abuse, the substance helps to intensify the blocking-out. In other words, the psychological ability to block out is not strong enough. Therefore, drugs must be employed. For example, if a client says, "I know you're judging me," his inner child is both blocking-out and catastrophizing. They are not seeing me in present time. If I say, "You look good today," the client can block hearing the good things. Notice if blocking-out helps you to avoid particular experiences, either by blocking parts of yourself or by blocking-out the world. I treated an alcoholic woman who would block out as a child, in her family setting, in order to survive. Later in life, she continued blocking, which affected her relationships. This is no surprise.
