It needs to be noted that I am not discounting healers. I am, however, suggesting that for a healing to take place, the person being healed must be conscious, aware, and responsible for their internal experience. If they are not responsible, and not willing to make internal and external changes, the healing will be temporary and will not last. If someone thinks someone else can take their pain, they are in an inner-child identity and will probably be drawn to a healer who is, also, in an age-regressed inner-child identity imag- ining they can take another's pain. In my life, my inner child always chose women who would argue with me. ("I want a girl, just like the girl who married dear old Dad"). After years of therapy and six years in a treatment facility (in India called an Ashram), I was aware of the problem and could interrupt the process. Still my inner child was working. One night, my best friend, David took me to watch Sufi Dancing in Los Angeles. About 75 people were there, some watchers, some doers.
