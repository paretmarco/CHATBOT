This structuring in accordance with time sequences is a mental construction which is automatically worked out by our mind. While some people have a long temporal horizon, the temporal horizon of other people is short. Our self, our acquired personality, is made up of such sequences. As for our inward essential being, it is, by contrast, normally located beyond time. Sometimes our self might actually be based on a sequence marked by an incongruous duration, such that it might even prevent us from attaining our ideals and expressing ourselves outwardly. This is for instance the case of the person who, in order to make an impression on his friends (“self” characterized by too short a time sequence), fritters away all his assets; or even, on the other end of the same spectrum, the condition of the miser who does not spend on himself, and who is unable to realize that his life is subject to a temporal duration and is thus shortly drawing to an end.
