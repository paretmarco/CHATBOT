The important thing is to do it within six hours from the moment when the memory is recalled, as it is within such a time span that fear becomes entrenched again. Anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress are linked to bad experiences which become rooted in the mind. Whenever a certain stimulus reminds one of the experience which he had gone through, fear resurfaces and anxiety grows, even though the stimulus is not dangerous per se. Let as illustrate it with an example: If a man from Abruzzo in Italy, who had experienced the earthquake which shook that region, senses some minor readjustment shakes, it is highly probable, in spite of the fact that such negligible shakes pose no danger, that he is going to feel panic and hasten to take shelter in a tent, merely through his recollection of the tragic night of the past 6th of April. Muscular tensions, too, are purely reminiscences of significant events which have become “embedded” in the body, in the light of the fact that a tension of the body might correspond to any mental tension. The said study has been carried out by inducing a state of fear in some volunteers who chose to be tested.
