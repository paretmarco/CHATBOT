To handle this chaotic discrepancy the inner child within his students spiritu- alized it saying, "He drank and had sex for us, to teach us he was human." Unfortunately the gurus and teachers are as involved in spiritu- alizing as the disciples, hence the attraction (like attracts like). This duplicates the process with the parents. The victim-abuser or disciple-guru are two sides of the inner child identity trance. The Inner Children within the Guru Let me state this more clearly. The guru has two inner spiritu- alized children. One has fused with the grandiosity, and one is the unknowing child. The disciple has the same two inner children. The disciple trance-fers the all-knowing grandiosity on the guru, mak- ing him into an all-knowing saint. The guru counter-trance-fers this, becoming the grandiose teacher. The guru trance-fers his unknowing inner child on the disciple and then the disciple is seen as unknowing and ignorant. The trance-ference must be broken and dismantled for the observer to wake-up and true inner awareness to develop. Unfortunately, all too often the guru or therapist gets addicted to the adulation of the disciple, and becomes blinded by his/her own trance-ference and counter-trance-ference issues.
