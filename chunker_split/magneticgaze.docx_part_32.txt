If you cannot find such a ball, you can settle for a round crystal container filled with clear water. Thereafter, place the ball or the round container on the table, in such a manner that the surrounding light is going to concentrate on a precisely demarcated and shining spot. Thereupon, as you are comfortably seated in front of the object, half a metre away from it, you should fix the luminous point, at first for one minute, and then for a progressively longer period that eventually reaches up to a quarter of an hour. Exercise 4 – The glass Create in yourself a state of relaxation and calmness. You might even look at the aforesaid crystal ball, or alternatively at a glass. Take that object and, as you look inside it, issue the following instruction to your self: “My look is getting strong”. Exercise 5 – The mirror Implement now the very same exercise in front of a mirror. Keep in mind, as you proceed with it, that you should always retain self-consciousness. [22] Exercise 6. The oblique disk Affix the cardboard disk onto a mirror.
