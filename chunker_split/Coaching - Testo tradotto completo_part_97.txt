An exercise is deemed to have been implemented perfectly so long as the brain’s attention has not been interrupted. It is thus clear that one cannot simultaneously implement an exercise properly while at the same time worrying as to whether the exercise is being carried out well. As soon as the mind poses itself that question, the exercise is ipso facto brought to an end thereby. Accordingly, the question, ‘Have I implemented this exercise correctly?’, will always be, and by its nature can never fail to be, a retrospective one, that is, a question relating to an exercise that has already been completed. Based on the foregoing, when you set out to work on a particular exercise, you should focus your thought on the exercise itself rather than on «the implementation of the exercise». The adept is warmly exhorted to ponder this sentence well, as the whole secret of successful accomplishment of the method is ensconced within its folds. On a daily basis Try and be present to what you do. Remove your thought from either the past or the future. Be in what you are busy doing.
