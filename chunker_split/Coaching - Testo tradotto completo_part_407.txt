Ensuring the existence of that state might be availed at times by the action of being able to touch upon elements which are peripheral vis-à-vis the central idea. We must also bring that in relation to the fact that we should take the interlocutor's acceptance of the central idea as granted. For instance, a doctor trying to push a person to consent to his admission to hospital might say to him, ‘Do not forget to bring along some reading material’; a salesperson, on the other hand, will always focus on speaking of the benefits which are attendant on purchasing an item, rather than on the purchase itself, and so on and so forth. The significant aspect is to think and visualize whatever one is saying. Fascination is a tool for suggesting ideas without awakening the conscious mind. In order to communicate emotionally with a person, one must necessarily use language in a special way. We should remember in this connection that to level criticisms or pose questions might have the effect of waking up the critical mind. It is therefore important that we should already know what to say, and that we should talk about aspects which do not involve one’s critical faculty.
