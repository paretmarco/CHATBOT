These inborn gifts to choose a direction in life finds expression in the realms of thoughts, facts and coincidences that seem to indicate a specific path which is, at the same time, a path that is intrinsically tailor-made for us and one that corresponds to our distinguishing peculiarities. “Causality is no more than a principle, and psychology cannot be exhausted merely by having recourse to causal methods, due to the fact that the spirit (the psyche) lives to an equal extent out of goals it aims for” (Carl Gustav Jung) When they are truthful, these are never constrictions, but rather openings. We must understand that they represent possibilities which the Universe grants us in order for us to find an outward outlet of self-expression. We must avoid viewing them as obligations, as we should rather deem them possible directions we can take for the sake of living out life. The truth is that we “play” with life, in the sense that life is always complete in itself, whichever way one spends it. The higher your presence and perception, the better will be your understanding of these originating impulses.
