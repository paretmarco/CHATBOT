Notice what the object or situation or experience looks and sounds like. Feel or notice sensations and feelings, the sensations inside your body associated with that particular desire. Notice its size and shape. Take the label off and see it as energy. Focus your awareness CM the desire inside you, the energy or sensations called "desire" inside, rather than on the desired object. Pull your attention inside to the desire itself, delabel it, and experience it as energy, allowing It (the energy) to do whatever it does. Simply watch the desire as energy inside you. A student asked if he should see desire as something negative. I replied that desire is desire. There is no bad or good about it, it's just energy. I would suggest that as you go through your life in the next few days, you work with any desire coming into your awareness. Suppose you are driving your car and you notice a new Porsche, or you might see a Porsche in your mind's eye. For that moment, your desire is called, "I want a Porsche."
