R. Bandler and J. Grinder, drawing on what they gathered from the modeling of M. Erickson, V. Sartir and F. Perls’ communicative strategies, have always leaned towards all the techniques that allowed the therapist to generate a harmonious rapport, indispensable in activating the change process. For example, M. Erickson had great ability in using EVERYTHING that the client provided, with the aim of generally “pacing” the client’s own “model of the world”. Although Erickson KNEW what he did with his patients, he found it difficult to explain HOW he did it. M. Erickson didn’t “judge” his client; he simply used learning processes, without imposing metaphors, values and beliefs outside of his experience: each intervention dedicated to the elimination of the so called learned limitations was carried out through the activation of the client’s natural learning processes. In NLP, “rapport” means “tuning”: when we pace our interlocutor at various descriptive levels, we allow him/ her to recognize himself/ herself in our communication and, consequently, trust us. NLP can be usefully described as a multi-level, matching and leading system, organized inside a hieratic structure. Climbing up through these levels, we gradually pass from single techniques capable of generating a rapport (chunking down) to more developed, integrated models for personality evaluation: the Enneagram (chunking up). The hypothesis we want to demonstrate is that: We have tried to visually demonstrate this concept by using the schematic presented in the following table (a thank you to Stefano Sessini for the graphic layout).
