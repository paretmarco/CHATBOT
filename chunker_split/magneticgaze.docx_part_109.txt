Fascination, in fact, has the effect of creating a “trance” which is similar to that amnesia, inasmuch as fascination is normally characterized by hyper-vigilance followed by amnesia. Fascination is accordingly in a position to act directly on the above-described phenomenology of daily trance, thereby yielding excellent therapeutic results. It is enough to fix the look on the subject and ask him to revert to that past episode. What the subject would normally be unable to accomplish in a normal state might then be actualized by whim while in a state of fascination. 4. Negative hallucination (deflection of the look) Most frequent effects when it is negatively pervasive: Finding it difficult to identify resources in one’s own life. An illustrating example of this state might be encountered in a depressed person who says, ‘I have never been happy!’, even though we saw him laughing only on the day before. How is it possible that he does not remember? What he says probably originates in a “cancellation” of a part of reality. Indeed, this phenomenology is also termed "cancellation" by Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and consists in failing to perceive one part of reality.
