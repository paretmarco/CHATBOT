We find in this short anecdote, which might be further supplemented by thinking of Caesar's magnetic look many people have made mention of, we can already discern the definition of a magnetic man who is capable of persuading others, who hangs onto the specific line he has chosen to pursue and who simultaneously throws other people into a state of “confusion”. Julius Caesar used to exercise his hegemonic domination over those pirates, to such an extent that it looked as if he was the actual person in charge of the ship rather than a prisoner in somebody else’s hands. Whenever he wanted to take a rest or go to sleep, he would forbid his "wardens" to make any noise, whereupon they would abide by his instruction unquestioningly. He would revile them and issue orders to them as if they were his servants, and they would be unable to disobey him at all. Still on the subject of examples drawn from the old classical times, Cicero mentions a certain Titinius, who lived in Rome.
