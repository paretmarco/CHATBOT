Many people make the mistake of never thinking in a really energetic way, of failing to activate their mind. As for another group of people, they fall into the error of never giving themselves a true rest. What results in both such cases is the impossibility of developing any elevated mental power. When a question is posed to you, you should, by contrast, learn to concentrate on it the fire of your mind. You ought to banish any extraneous thought away. When you judge yourself to be in need of some rest, vacate from your mind, in exactly the same fashion, the problem you were previously bent on exploring. It is only in this way that you will soon discover yourselves to be gifted with renewed energies. The important creations are always the fruit of strict mental discipline. The technique to practice such discipline might be summarized in this precept which Manzoni highlighted: “Think over”, that is: Think about the target of your meditation and do not abandon the primary for the sake of the accessory. Every sequence of thoughts must give rise to a self-contained closed circle, as opposed to forming a chain with neither beginning nor end.
