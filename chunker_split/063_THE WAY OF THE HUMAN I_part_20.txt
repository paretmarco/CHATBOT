In other words, to be fully human means to be aware of the external world while being aware of our animal nature with its sexual desires, etc., our thinking and emotional dimensions with its pain and pleasure, ESSENCE with its qualities of love, peace, etc., the I AM, the COLLECTIVE, and the "NOT-I-I". This is the development of Multi-Dimensional Awareness, which is the Way of the Human, and which might or may hopefully aid in the discovery of WHO YOU ARE. Quantum physics has shown us beautifully that everything is made of the same substance. With this knowledge, how could anything be inherently bad, something to be gotten rid of, or something which can lead us away from our true nature? We must therefore appreciate all of the dimensions of being human with the understanding that each dimension has a function, and allow each dimension to work according to its nature. This means not substituting or trying to overcome one dimension, like using ESSENCE to overcome the emotional dimension, or the thinking dimension to overcome the biological dimension.
