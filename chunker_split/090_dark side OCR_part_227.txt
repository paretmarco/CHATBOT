In cognitive therapy this thinking distortion is called, Heaven's Reward Fallacy. "In this framework for viewing the world, you always do the "right thing" in hope of reward. You sacrifice and slave, and all the while imagine you are collecting "brownie points" you can cash in some day. (McKay, 1981:25) Notice how rooted this is in the infant or inner child state. In the spiritualizing process, this is a constant occurrence. An example is the Hindu systems of work and sacrifice for liberation. In the Spiritualizing + 141 Christian religion, sacrifice is seen as noble. The problem is that all to often people sacrifice themselves with hope of being rewarded, and the reward doesn't come. The infant/child within reduces the world to simple units of cause (I'm good) yields effect (I get money, power, God, etc.). 4. Specialness. Specialness is a third level trance the child creates in which they see themselves as special, as a reaction formation or defense for not getting the caretaking they imagine they are entitled to. Years later the child within the adult expects to be taken care of for being good, or just special.
