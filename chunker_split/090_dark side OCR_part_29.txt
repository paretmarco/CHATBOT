In 1986, my first book, Trances People Live: Healing Ap- proaches in Quantum Psychology, talked of the impact of the observer (you) upon your subjective experience. In a nutshell, the observer (you), creates his/her internal subjective experience. You create a response to the environment, i.e., parents, teachers, hus- bands, wives, etc., and you are responsible for your internal, subjective experiences. To put this in Quantum Psychology terms, you, as the observer of external reality, participate in the creation of your internal, subjective responses and reactions. Now, let's take this in the realm of the "wounded inner child identity." Let's say at a young age, you observed that the only way to get loved by Mom/Dad was to give up your own needs in favor of theirs and to please them. To handle this the observer creates an identity called "pleasing child" who gives up his/her own needs to gain love and approval. If the observer sees that this works, the observer continues to create this identity and places this identity of wounded pleasing child on automatic and then goes to sleep. Who is lost in this mistaken identity?
