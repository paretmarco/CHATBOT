We cannot know what we need to look for to become human until we first "explore" where we area Second, we need to learn to see the subtle nuances which prevent us from being human. In the next few chapters we will explore multi-dimensional awareness. In the Special Section the focus will be on trances and spiritual pitfalls. We will look at the most frequently misunderstood trances (psychological and spiritual as well as mundane) which take us out of our body, out of relationships, out of the world, out of present time and out of humanity. And, ultimately, out of ESSENCE and the Underlying Unity of Quantum Consciousness. In the words of my teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj, "You cannot let go of something until you know what it is." Quantum Psychology takes this one step further: "You cannot let go of something until you are willing to experience it." The Special Section may seem difficult but I ask you to stay with it and persevere. For it is here that you will find a discussion of these machine-like automatic trances which are our deepest, most resistant problem, the ones most difficult to confront.
