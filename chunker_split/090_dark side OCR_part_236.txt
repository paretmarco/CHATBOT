If something bad happens, I must have a lesson to learn. Spiritualization believes in Good behavior = Good outcomes, Bad behavior = bad outcomes. If I'm good get; if I'm bad I won't get. Good people get good, bad people get bad. Chaos occurs because this is not the case. The Discrepancy For example, Mafia people own houses on the beach, and good people get stuck with bad cars. Incongruent experience causes chaos, to be rationalized spiritually by the child within. "I guess the person had karma from another life. That' s why good didn' t happen to a good person." Or, "I wonder what lessons they need to learn?" "I wonder why they created bad happenings to themselves." Spiritual Re, rames and Rationalizations 1. Bad happens to Good: "I guess that there is a lesson they needed to learn." 2. Bad happens to Good: "There must be a higher purpose or higher plan." 3. God gives me what I need: "When you don't get what you need, you must not have really needed it." Spiritualization has very strong cultural roots.
