In the latter case, one must be cognizant of how to utilize his own unconscious, his natural automatic side, as well as the “spontaneous acting” by the body, in its capacity as a spontaneous partner in the activity, from the premise of utilizing the available time down to the implementation of every single action, with the result that the part thereof which is resolved upon by the higher centres of the brain is circumscribed to the mere initial push. It is indeed enough, for the man who pursues such a discipline, to say “I do”, for everything to then unfold itself "naturally”. Succeeding in not doing something because of an extreme resolution from the mind, and yet managing to do it, is thus the ultimate goal which is attainable through the mental discipline our method proposes. The effort, the ambition of any disciple, ought to be directed at reducing the need to make use of the brain’s higher centres across the largest possible number of daily actions, and discovering an alternative path for hearing the voice of one’s unconscious and one’s naturalness, and above all, the voice of one's own “essential being”.
