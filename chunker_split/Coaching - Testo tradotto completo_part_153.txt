You should likewise eliminate the anxieties associated with expectation: If you are unable to wait, then steer your activity towards something else; if, instead, you can wait, there is no benefit in getting restlessly agitated. You must finally stop mulling over the same ideas, the same situations. You should avoid visiting places which you have already seen hundreds of times before, or listening to music you know by heart. Try to always search for novelties if you want your life to have nice fullness. In that manner you will gain such a huge saving of time that the person who has never experienced this systematic process of elimination would never even suspect. In the event that useless ideas were to surface in your minds because of psychological automatism, you should strive to chase them away by denying their existence or by clinging to different ideas.
