This book is about going beyond the dark side of the inner child, and the trances of the inner child. To awaken the observerIcreator of the inner child is to end the trances of the inner child. In other words, awakening the observer ends the trance. Stated another way, to transcend the frozen states of the inner child you must end your trances. This is the real process of trance-ending.. I hope you enjoy the process. With love, Your brother, Stephen â€¢ 1 Where it All Began for Me For almost six years, I lived in a monastery in India. Before that, I conducted a private psychotherapy and training practice in Los Angeles, California. While in India it became apparent to me that meditation could be seen as an Eastern way of de-hypnotizing myself from my mental program, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and emotions. By de-hypnotizing myself I no longer felt compelled nor obsessed by the never ending chatter of the mind.
