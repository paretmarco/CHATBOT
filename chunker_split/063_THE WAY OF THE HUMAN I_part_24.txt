my life had changed through psychology and certainly' I no longer felt self-defeating but much more powerful and in touch with my body and feelingsâ€”but still I felt unfinished. I had not found out WHO I WAS. For years I put aside psychology since I saw that SELF-ACTUALIZATION was the end point of psychology and was not all that I had hoped it would be. I decided to go to India to seek SELF-REALIZATION. By 1976 I was headed for India and SELF-REALIZATION ("NOT-I-I") and WHO I WAS. In India, and later on in the United States, through yoga and Buddhist practices, many of us were able to experience quite readily the empty-mind (no-mind), pure WITNESSING, and the underlying unity I now call Quantum Consciousness. Unfortunately, in India it was stated both overtly and covertly that to attain and live in THAT VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS required a giving-up of the world. At first, this seemed romantic, noble, and super-spiritual; but in the end I saw that this was both impractical and unrealistic. After all, most of us live, work, have relationships, and interact with the world. In the late-1970s, I felt split.
