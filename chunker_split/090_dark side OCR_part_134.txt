Some of us are hyper-sensitive to anything suggesting loss, and blind to any indication of gain." (Mckay, 1981:19) Wonderfulizing or Awfulizing Wonderfulizing relates to the former example, in which Mom selected Dad' s remembrance of the child' s birthday to the exclusion of the daily drinking. Awfulizing is explained this way. "By the very process of filtering you magnify and awfulize your thoughts. When you pull negative thoughts out of context ... you make them larger and more awful than they are." (McKay, 1981:19) For example, a woman I was working with was molested by her uncle. During the process, her inner child stayed focused on his left eye. Years later, the time-frozen inner child would project and illusion the man she was with as her uncle by looking at his left eye. Awfulizing is a thinking distortion under the heading of illusioning or hallucination in trance land, or filtering in cognitive therapy land. (See Appendix, Trigger). As with all trance states, an illusion was created by the observer to help protect the child from the strains of family interactions.
