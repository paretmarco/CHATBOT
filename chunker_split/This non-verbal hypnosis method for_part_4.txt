Now open your eyes and visualize yourself in the water, as if in a crystal ball, with light shining in the water. Drink the water and allow yourself to relax. The operator can now if you are a subject do passes on specific endocrine points and chakras on your body, as well as on your organs to help regulate them. He will hold your wrists and focus on any problem areas you wish to address. He will repeat this sequence 5-9 times for 3 rounds. During this process, he may add non-verbal hypnosis techniques such as making small sounds, if it helps you to deepen the trance. Remember, this method can be used for any behavior change, not just weight loss. Adapt it to your own needs and preferences, and always use caution when inducing a deep trance.
