He does not wear himself out, and might be compared to a natural magnet, because he follows the path of Nature. The pathological magnetic person, by contrast, is the slave of his own thoughts, which emerge with great clarity in his mind but over which he exercises no genuine control. It is as though he is dominated by an obsession rather than dominating his own mind. He exhausts himself a lot in the attempt to develop a magnetic charge, and might be compared to a piece of iron which is electrically charged by a dynamo, that is, thanks to a continuous effort8. He attracts, it is true, but he ends up attracting things which do not truly represent what he wants. What we are going to explain now is how to develop the man who is present to himself and active, and who is characterized by a healthy magnetism, which, by the way, is the more powerful and enduring form of magnetism, and the only one capable of producing satisfaction in life. This, in fact, is the man who will both attain his goals in life and be happy with himself. He will thus produce gold whether outside or inside himself.
