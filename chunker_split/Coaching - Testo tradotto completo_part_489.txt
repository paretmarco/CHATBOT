The real trader is the one who inquires about things, gathers information, grabs opportunities and scores a gain, not the one who obdurately sticks to one line only and lies even to his own self, because he desires things to unfold themselves in accordance with his subjective wishes. Traders’ Post-Hypnotic Suggestions Another context in which hypnotic forms of conditioning are important is the field of commands which have been received during one's childhood. For example, many people, when they were children, have assimilated the following suggestion: "The more you do, the more you are going to have". In trading, however, matters do not work that way. It happens at times that when one does too much, he fails to score gains, or, as one Italian proverb puts it, “too much is crippling”. In the field of hypnosis, “post-hypnotic suggestion” is the term used to define the state where a person keeps on obeying a particular injunction even when the stimulus is no longer present.
