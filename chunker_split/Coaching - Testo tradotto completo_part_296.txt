In the process, we must also try and figure out the moods which we might desire to experience, the words we are going to utter to the faces we will meet on the way, to whatever we will be hearing, feeling, suffering or enjoying. At first we will have to do that analytically, and then, by the final stage, we will do so through an act that summarizes a will and a desire which, owing to the fact it is going to transcend the sphere of the conscious, will transform each one of us into a magician unto his own self. It will thus cause the coming day to be felt as something present, in the process letting us perceive, through the magical crystal of presentification, what our personality will be tomorrow. The attitude resembles the one of a person facing a crystal ball. The only distinguisher is that the image will be suggested rather than be actually seen. By means of presentification, the future is going to be pulled into the field of the present. Presentification is thus an act of magic.
