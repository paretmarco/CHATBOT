Once this trace will have vanished completely, we shall reopen our eyes and identify a reply, assuming there is going to be any. You should take care to write down, or in any other way keep note of, whichever thing might come to your beings. Thereafter, if you so wish, you will repeat the procedure. There are times when solutions surface to your attention at once, in order for them to be subsequently followed by yet another set of even more valid solutions. According to the modern quantum conception, both these paths, the classical and the accelerated / modern ones, address our “total” or “quantum” mind, and kick-start a reasoning which is other than linear, as it rather unfolds itself in a different manner, one which works on the whole rather than on the separate parts. Remind yourselves to stay in the present, in the now, at the time when you observe the residual image. It is in the now, indeed, that re-integration might find its actualization. By proceeding in the said fashion, it will not be the conscious mind, i.e. our circumscribed reason 89, which discovers the solution, but rather our own global being.
