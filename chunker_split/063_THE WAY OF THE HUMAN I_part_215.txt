131 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THE BIOPSYCHOLOGICAL: THE BIOLOGICAL-0THE PSYCHOLOGICAL For nearly 25 years, I have been a consistent receiver of body work. "I" have received Reichian therapy as well as hundreds of Rolfings and Feldenkrais sessions. "I" did Tai Chi for several years and have been doing Hatha Yoga everyday for almost 12 years. It has become apparent that it is the body which links together all of the dimensions, i.e., the External dimension, the Thinking dimension, the Feeling dimension, the Biological dimension, ESSENCE, the I AM, the COLLECTIVE and the "Not-I-I." Quantum psychology defines the mind as consisting of a person's thoughts, memories, emotions, associations, perceptions and a scanning-searching device which scans the "external" and tends to create overgeneralizations, using past associations. It is important to know that the mind comes from the body. In other words, the nervous system and the biological fight/flight system, which are part of the physical body's nature, are also the governing and ruling principles behind a person's psychology (i.e., the thinking and emotional dimensions along with their memories and associations).
