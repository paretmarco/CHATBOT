Post-hypnotic suggestions (incongruence) Most frequent effects when such suggestions are pervasive: Mental rigidity, finding it difficult to change and adapt, asymmetrical movements of the body We call by this name the automatic reactions which many people have learnt in their young age. Many post-hypnotic suggestions are in fact linked to the parents’ behaviour and correspond to what Freud had described as the super ego, that is, those inner voices which tell us what to do and what not to do. In this case, the child had been asked to see reality from the viewpoint of the parent. The parent had imparted peremptory “injunctions” to him, such as “do this”, “you must”, or “it is obligatory”. In due course, these automatic reactions act as blocks to the mind and to one’s own spontaneous responses. Technical characteristics of this state: One hypothesis which has been put forward in this respect is that what enables a suggestion to “endure” in the mind is the circumstance that it is not adequately processed. What essentially occurs is that the mind receives an idea, and such idea becomes rooted in it.
