For example, if you have a troublesome thought, call it a thought; if you have a troublesome internal voice, call it an internal dialogue. In this way, you will be able to differentiate between the different aspects of consciousness. Step III: Dialogue with the aspect. Ask the aspect, "What are you resisting knowing about yourself?" Write down your answers until nothing "pops up." Step IV: Notice what the aspect is resisting as you continue to enquire. Step V: Realizing what the aspect is ultimately resisting, allow the aspect to experience what it is resisting and then notice the Chapter VI EMPTINESS surrounding it and "see/experience" the EMPTINESS and the aspect as the same substance. Step VI: Stay in the nonverbal I AM level prior to the arising of thoughts and JUST BE (to be discussed later). This is the I AM which leads to the NOT-I I beyond observation (i.e. the observer-observed dyad.) This exercise will hopefully help to open the doorway and help to stabilize beyond your identification with the thinking dimension. SUMMARY SO FAR The thinking dimension is how we (the nervous system) think and interpret the world.
