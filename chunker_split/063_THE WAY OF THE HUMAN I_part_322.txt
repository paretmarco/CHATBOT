These common experiences are characteristic re-enactments of very early childhood experiences, particularly in relationship to your mother and father. Simply stated, you act as a child and expect your spouse to act as your mother or father. This is collapsing the levels. Fourth, the past-time "self' is relating to the internalized (past-time) other (usually mom or dad), and hence, trance-furs the past-time other onto the present-time relationship. You treat the present-time other as the past-time other. For example, recall a time you felt abandoned by your partner for not being there when you wanted them to be there for you. This is a sure sign of collapsing the levels and an age-regression. Abandonment as an issue should be another red flag that a collapsing of the levels and an age-regression has taken place. The adult trance-fers momldad onto the other in their relationship and becomes the past-time self and then feels abandoned. Fifth, the past-time "self' actually hypnotizes the present-time "self," making them believe present time is past time. For example, notice in your life when you age-regress that later on, you cannot believe your own behavior.
