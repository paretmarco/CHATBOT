107 Wolinsky:What assumptions do you have about Electro- magnetics creating a field with a coil? Louise:I have to work to keep my body balanced, it was something that was done to me. Wolinsky:Because of this structure, what impact has it had on how you have organized your life? Louise:I do body and energy work for a living, I alter my life around energy and electgro-magnetics. Wolinsky:Regarding this Electro-magnetics field and the coil what have you done to yourself? Louise:Isolated and limited my life. Wolinsky:How does this Electro-magnetics coil seem to you now? Louise:Like an implant from another dimension. Therapeutic Note Here we see many Archetypes, for example, Gurdjieff refers to the Kundabuffer, a mechanism which makes everything the opposite of what it is. Other new age "spiritual" systems use this implant concept. It should be noted that this is not a put-down but an opportunity to look at what Archetypical Physics Dimension structures which organize your "spiritual path" in order to go beyond them. Wolinsky:Regarding the Coilâ€”Electra-magnetics implant how have you deceived yourself? Louise:Believing it is or has power.
