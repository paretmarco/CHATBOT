King Minos (who is now a fallen higher self or ESSENCE) believes in separa- 266 Appdendix tion. He finds out that Daedalus (the architect) built the container (image) of the cow to attract the Bull and to punish him; he throws Daedalus (the image maker) and his son, Icarus, (a reflection and a creation of the image maker) into the Labrinyth of the unconscious mind. Daedalus makes fake wings out of sticks and wax so that they can fly away. Here the image maker creates (automatically) (a False Self to overcome the False Core) more images, i.e., something false to get out of the unconscious mind. Here we see the newer psychology's false .attempt to create a new image or presentation (False Self) to go beyond the unconscious (False Core) rather than going into it. The two try to escape by using this False Self vehicle. Icarus (the image of the image maker) flies too close to the sun (a symbolic representation of God), with the (false) wings of wax.
