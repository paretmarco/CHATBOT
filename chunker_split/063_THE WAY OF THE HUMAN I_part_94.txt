Now if someone like that were to do Vipassana meditation (insight meditation) or cognitive therapy, it would be the worst thing in the world because it would reinforce their structure. For these reasons the "person" who is teaching the system has to know the systems' weak as well as its strong suits, who it is good for and who it's not good for, and then refer people out according to where they need to go. To offer a system like insight meditation to an over-observer who dissociates and observes as a defense only re-enforces the structure, as does offering the conversion of vices to virtues to somebody with a strong Christian background. It will reinforce the defensive strategy of the False Self (Compensator), unknowingly re-enforcing an age regression (False Core) or integrative age regressive (False Self). Offering a system which re-enforces the defenses of a person who is suffering can be tantamount to offering an alcoholic a drink. Psychology and spirituality are not "one-size-fits-all." I think this is part of the problem with both of these disciplines. Recently I was doing a demonstration with a woman who had been sexually 47 A The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness abused.
