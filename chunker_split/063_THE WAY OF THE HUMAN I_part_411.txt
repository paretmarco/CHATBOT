Here the virgins are supposedly eaten by the Minotaur, but Quantum Psychology says that they are absorbed and reunited with their own sexuality as a natural function and a part of the whole. From the point of view of separation, the seven virgins are destroyed (by sexuality). From the point of view of Quantum Psychology, they are reunited with their natural biological function, and the body (sex) mind separation disappears. Buried deeply within the Labyrinth of the unconscious mind lies the Minotaur which is viewed as the monster (of sexuality) by the forces of separation and division. King Aegeus (Mr. Separation himself) cannot bear sending virgins to be destroyed (absorbed) by the Minotaur (sexuality). He sends his son Thesus (the son of Mr. Separation) disguised as a male virgin to the Labyrinth (unconscious mind) of the Minotaur (sexuality) to destroy the Minotaur (sexuality). Again King Aegeus does not want to look at the lie of his imagined separation from his own sexuality which also separates him from the unified whole. Instead he looks outside himself and blames others for his separation. He wants to destroy others rather than dissolve his separating concepts.
