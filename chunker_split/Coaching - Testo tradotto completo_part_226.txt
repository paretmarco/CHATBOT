It must in fact solve the following problem: Arranging oneâ€™s life in such a way that, even if death were to truncate it at the start or in the middle of that day, life would in any event have already received a prize for its efforts. As we have stated in the introduction to this book, not every person is the beneficiary of the gift of clearly perceiving the purpose of his existence. It is due to the aforesaid that the youth who are still going through the stage of being initiated into life, are hardly likely to talk of an ideal with the conviction that it is not going to change in the years to come. It is therefore possible to also formulate programs with a narrower range, always taking care to be connected to one's own self. Be it as it may, having an excellent friend can be a great ideal at any stage of one's life.
