Erickson introduced the naturalistic/utilization approaches to trance work and therapy that have become the foundation for a paradigmatic shift in the entire field of psychotherapy. In my work with Ericksonian principles, I became convinced that Erickson's naturalistic approaches could be integrated with Eastern orientations and perspectives. Ilie key puzzle pieces—trance stales, inter- rupting patterns of response , and symptoms—were present in each. The differences between the two approaches arose in how each of these puzzle pieces related to the other. In the Eastern view, trance states arc continually coming and going; the purpose of meditating is to Learn to develop some part of the awareness so that it can watch or observe the flow of the trances and the flow of consciousness. This observing part is thereby no longer identified with the ebb and flow of mental life.
