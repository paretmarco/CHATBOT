I found this out .... "I Found Out" John Lennon 124 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Preamble Before I discuss spiritualizing and its effects, it is important for me to emphasize several points. First, what prevents a true communion with the underlying unity is our automatic trances. Secondly, the intention of this section is to free us all from the past and age-regressed world views, which inhibit our experience of this underlying unity. Third, what we are left with is uninterrupted awareness uninhibited by memory, distortion, resistance to chaos, or in a word, trances. It is with this pure, uninterrupted awareness, without prior automatic trances, that the natural interconnection and unity becomes more available. This natural unity, called "quantum consciousness" is what I believe to be a natural spirituality. A spirituality where we are free to be separate and free to feel the interconnection of everything as a choice, rather than automatic separation or automatic fusion, which can be mistaken for unity. While I travel and train individuals in my workshops I am often asked, "What makes for a good client or practitioner in this style of work?"
