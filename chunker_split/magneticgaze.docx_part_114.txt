Exercise 35: Aimed at attaining confidence in one’s tone of voice Say something which you are utterly certain of (for example, ‘I am ... (your own name)’, or else, ‘I live in (your street)’. Take notice of the tone of voice which you are mentally going to use. By working on your own selves, you will be able to discern the different impact which the look might exercise. Slowly, you will develop a better understanding of the dynamics of fascination even as they apply to other persons in whose company you happen to be, since you will become aware of the different states through which you are going to pass, and are accordingly going to comprehend that such states might belong to the people you are going to captivate. 8.
