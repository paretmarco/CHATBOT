- The energy model of the individual is vectorial, so it has a precise direction and speed. Under this point of view the concept energy can be comparable to the study of a series of flows. These flows can be seen both as waves that as compounds of elements. And for the Heisenberg principle the determination of a dimension, prevent the determination of the other dimensions. So if we experience the flow we will not experience the - The "emotional states" define the basic reasons of acting of the individual, and every emotional state exists in a particular time and place. In other words, the emotional states exists only related to contexts and situations. Emotonal states are in a superposition scheme until the moment in which they are not determined by measuring them in a specific context. Emotional states can also be defined interior activators. Emotional states always exist in digital form, that is, each emotional state is opposed to its opposite. To emotional states we connect the concept of "physiological state of action" linguistically corresponding to the verbs and "environmental indices" linguistically corresponding to the various elements (place, agent etc ...). Environmental indices exist only in function of their localization in a context space and time of their conceptualization. The processes of abstraction and association of neuronal networks within the mind mean that more environmental indexes of second level may be gathered in the top-level or "constructs" and give shape to a class even higher.
