If thoughts of life come up, or if anything comes up, say to "yourself', "There is life." Rather than "My life," say "There is life." Then ask, "What knowER is knowing that (.e., thought, feeling, etc.). Notice again you go blank into the NONVERBAL I AM and Beyond. Nisargadatta once told me, "The problem is that you identify yourself as a person in life, rather than WITNESSING, (beyond the observer-observed or knower-known dyad), that there is life, which actually has nothing to do with you, so you should stay out of it." In the Avadhut Stotram it is said that someone in that No-State state and beyond has no need to accept or reject and is beyond attributes and qualities, beyond even the concept of existence and nonexistence. SUMMARY AND EXERCISES The verbal I AM precedes the False Core-FALSE SELF, and cuts the connection because first you would have to say I AM (fill in the blank with a False Core). The NON-VERBAL I AM is prior even to this and is beyond qualities, even the Essential qualities of ESSENCE, and is the ESSENCE of ESSENCE.
