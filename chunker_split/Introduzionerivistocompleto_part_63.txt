Therefore, you can, at any time in your life, change and improve yourself by choosing the way that you feel is most agreeable to you at that time, without having to make lengthy analysis on the “why” of a difficulty or behavior you want to alter. “The impossible is an absurdity. All that is good is an integrated part of your being!” PROGRESSIVE CONCEPTS EPISTEMOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THE NEW HYPNO-RAPPORT CONCEPT Remarks & Considerations NOTE: this last chapter reports a more in-depth summary. It is essentially aimed at those who are already familiar with the subject and want to look further into it. The “Palo Alto” school, through the work and thoughts of scientists like P. Watzlawick, J. Weakland and G. Bateson, introduced a very pragmatic analysis model which, in turn, was adopted by NLP: The Theory of Logical Levels. By Logical Level we mean the possibility of analyzing “reality” at different description levels; for example, if we consider a forest, we can take into consideration its entirety (chunking up), or we can concentrate our attention on a single tree (chunking down). Both of these interpretational levels are useful in analyzing the reality that surrounds us. However, in certain situations it would be more convenient to consider it in general terms, while in others, the analysis of the “particular” would be more appropriate.
