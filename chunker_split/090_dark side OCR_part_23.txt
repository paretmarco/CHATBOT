The child within hypnotizes the child by automatically saying things to you that make you go into a trance. You behave in ways you would rather not, or you may go into a trance that worked under trauma in the past, but is not appropriate for the present-time situation. The child within becomes your hypnotist, and the adult in present time, the subject, continues getting hypnotized into un- wanted behaviors and experiences. After returning to the West in 1982, I re-opened my psycho- therapy practice. I began to explore with my clients and trainees therapeutic trance states. I realized that many problems individuals were experiencing were due to the child within hypnotizing the adult. The inner child had developed an autonomous life of its own, a dark side. I began to de-hypnotize myself. I realized that hours of medi- tation was not appropriate for this culture; it is just too time consuming. The pitfalls meditators experienced in the past resulted from not being connected to the world. And often times, as will be noted in Chapter 6, Dis-connecting, meditation can become a dissociative technique, used to hide a trauma and its accompanying fear, pain, and anger.
