Progression in time (temporal pseudo-orientation) (look BEYOND) Most frequent effects when such progression in time is pervasive: Lack of a concrete approach to reality, anxiety, fear of the future, and fear of the possibility of improving one’s volitional resolution and action The person who is immersed in a constant “temporal progression" is the eternal dreamer, who at the end of the day might fail to accomplish any practical result in the present. His look, in extreme forms of this trance, is lost in a void, as if he was busy observing a distant point. It is the look of the “dreamer”. He speak by making recourse to a vocabulary consisting of such expressions as, ‘I am going to do’, ‘I am going to be’, etc ... The risk faced by such a personality type is to live too much in the future, without being however able to relate it to actions and to the reality of the present time, and without actually embarking on any practical steps in the present which aim at realizing his dreams.
