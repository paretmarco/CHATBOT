As I started doing therapy with her, she became terrified at the prospect of letting go. People who dis-connect, on the other hand are terrified if asked to be here. They will be frightened because as children they handled life by going away. It was too painful to deal with the reality of their family. My client experienced fear. If she went there, even for a minute, she heard a voice saying, "Where are you going? We 60 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child need you to take care of Daddy." If the husband who disconnected stayed here, the experience was equally awful. The reality was bombarding and overwhelming for him.

We will explore complementary trance patterns of the inner children within the adult who pick familiar partners.
