Unlike psychologies which imagine a body-mind split, Korzybski in Science and Sanity refers to the organism as a whole: Experience and experiments show us that the natural order is sensation first, idea next; the sensation being an abstraction of some (lower) (earlier) order, and the idea clearly an abstraction of an abstraction, (sensation). . . . This reversal of order in its mild form is involved in the confusion of orders of abstractions; namely that we act as if an idea were an experience." (p. 76). 'In this case "higher" is called "higher" because it is physically higher; i.e., the cortex is physically higher than the reptilian brain. However, to be less confusing, from this point on, we will call it the "newer" brain since it evolved much later in time. 120 Chapter VIII According to Korzybski, sensation, thought and emotion are all interconnected, they are all part of the whole organism although, neurologically speaking, sensations come before ideas.
