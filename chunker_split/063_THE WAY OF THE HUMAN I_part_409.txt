The method (wings) doesn't work (melts)''and he falls into the sea, the unified whole. From the point of view of the divided mind, at first glance this seems like death. Howe-Vâ€˜er, from the point of view of the unified whole, there is no birth or death. In reality, Icarus falls, into the unified whole. This fall is a symbolic representation of what occurs when a false method or means or path is used to get free of the mind. Since the method is false, it appears that it cannot carry you back to God (non-dual awareness). In this way at first you feel and think you are free, but sooner or later, the methods melt (are seen to be false) as it approaches the heat of the non-dual awareness of God (the Sun). In reality, however, everything is made of the same substance and is a unified whole. Externally from the point of view of the divided mind, it appears as though there is a "fall" because of a false method or false understanding. However, we all return to the unified whole mind (the ocean) at death.
