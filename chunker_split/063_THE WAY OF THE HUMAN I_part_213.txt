These relate directly to Superstrings and the Biological Brain function of other forces; gravity, electromagnetics, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force (to be discussed in Volume III). As of 1997, further research into dark matter, partial reality, light waves and sound are underway. 130 Chapter VII!
