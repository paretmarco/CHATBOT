Peter was with my teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj, just around the time that he died. We talked for a while about him and I asked Peter if he knew where I could get an audiotape of the chanting that took place in his room. Peter said that he had such a tape and that he would send a copy with arati (chanting) and some questions and answers taped in Maharaj's room. I used to listen to the tapes while I was driving to and from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. One day I heard Nisargadatta Maharaj say something which shocked me: In the beginning there was NOTHING, absolutely. The I AM appeared (condensed) within that NOTHINGNESS. And one day, the I AM will disappear (thin-out) and there will be NOTHING again and that is all it is." What shocked me was not that he had said it. What shocked me was that even though I had been with Nisargadatta Maharaj, I had never heard him saying anything like that. What was even more shocking was that I had been presenting this exact material in Quantum Psychology workshops for years and I did not know that he had ever said it.
