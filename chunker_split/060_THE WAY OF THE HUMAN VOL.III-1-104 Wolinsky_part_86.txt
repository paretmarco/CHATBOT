This leads toward the collective "experience" of Archetypes such as gods, "seekers after truth," "personal growth," enlightenment, anima-animus, etc. What will be delineated and discussed is the Quantum understanding of Archetypes and what is the "you" you call "you": 1 ) The Archetypical Collective Unconscious dimension as a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and as a by-product of the Physics Dimensions. 2. Many so-called Archetypes are not really Archetypes because they go from the bottom up—from the personal, regressed conscious mind—rather than from the top down (i.e., VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condensing). 3. The influence of the Physics Dimensions and forces on the creation of Archetypes. 4. Spiritual and psychological systems as Archetypical manifestations of the Physics Dimensions. 5. The I AM as the ultimate Archetype—the foundation which must exist and on which all other Archetypes are based. It too is a by-product of the contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. ________________ Chapter 111 BELIEVING WITHOUT ENQUIRING: THE RISE AND FALL OF CARL JUNG ARCHETYPES OF JUNG For Jung, an Archetype is made up of "archaic remnants of the psychic history of the human species."
