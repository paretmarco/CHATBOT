A parallel exists between what we do with mental energy and what we do with the gifts and possibilities life offers us, such as relationships and our money. Avoiding dispersions of mental energy and channelling it in the right direction represent human engagements which need to be carried out in order to increase energy, and thereby expand the range of our active doing. If we concentrate, the greater amplitude of mental power which is generated by concentration has the effect of us developing power in reality and naturally transcending habits. When that stage is reached, we will then be capable of enjoying the opportunities life supplies us with. The key of rhythm as a way of creating more energy Not only we can gather energy, but we can augment it as well. Our body is a machine which is designed in such a way as to create energy. As with any other machine, in order for that to happen, however, all its parties must act in synergy. From a physiological point of view, our organism is bilateral. In a similar fashion, our brain is made up of two hemispheres.
