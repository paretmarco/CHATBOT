THE DANGER OF DIAGNOSIS: TAKING PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE NOT There is a major problem in the world of psycho-spiritual practice. People think they can diagnose each other. Then, they think they know the person who has been diagnosed. As Korzybski said, "The map is not the territory" and "the idea is not the thing you are referring to." In this way, diagnosis and typing are not the person you are referring to. You must understand that the False Core-False Self, the Enneagram and the D.S.M. IV of Psychology are merely maps; they are constructions of the nervous system. But the nervous system does not see the underlying unity. It cannot because it is a condensation of the underlying unity. If you believe this Nervous System's construction (maps), you will never know Quantum Consciousness. Your concepts, especially your False Core Driver and False Self Compensator, have to de-constructed or disidentified from. PSYCHOLOGY'S FAILURE The most common trap for people is that they believe they are their False Core-False Self and that there are good parts and bad parts of it.
