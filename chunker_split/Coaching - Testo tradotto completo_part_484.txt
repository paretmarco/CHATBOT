We have come across this phenomenon on plentiful occasions: Our trader, in the past, has undertaken operations which have accrued to his benefit. Taking such previous experiences as his foundational departure point, he then re-enacts those very same operations, save that this time they prove a failure. He turns stubborn, and keeps on repeating them time and again, saying to himself in the process: “No doubt that stock is going to bounce back”. He looks over the Internet for articles which articulate the prediction of a U-turn inversion in the prevailing trend. Yet no such inversion factually takes place. Why is it that this person spends his money in this fashion, as opposed to resolving on changing strategy? The question we ought to pose to ourselves as regards the preceding illustration is this: "How can we know that the future is identical to the past?”. A good trader is equipped with a turning key, namely: Knowing that he does not know. Even though we might think we have a perfect working knowledge of a particular market, we should still grant us the suitable benefit of “knowing not to know”.
