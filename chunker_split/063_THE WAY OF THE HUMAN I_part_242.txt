Quan- 149 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness turn Psychology says that the degree to which you cannot be in your BIOLOGICAL CORE is the degree you get more into random thoughts, more into breakages, more imbalances, more energetic interruptions, more trancing-out, more into spiritualization and more disconnected from the other dimensions of your humanity. For this reason, from a Quantum Psychology perspective, the BIOLOGICAL CORE is a core dimension that needs to be worked with, acknowledged, and explored so that wherever your awareness is, i.e., ESSENCE, thinking level, etc., you can stay connected with the underlying unity which moves through the BIOLOGICAL CORE. Without this, your connection becomes disjointed, there are breakages and your realization of THAT becomes an idea, a concept rather than pure IS -NES S. ARCHETYPES AND THE BIOLOGICAL CORE When Quantum Psychology suggests that the BIOLOGICAL CORE is the meeting place between heaven (the sun) and earth, this can also be seen archetypically. The sun (metaphorically and archetypically) represent the father or God and the earth (metaphorically and archetypically) represent the mother.
