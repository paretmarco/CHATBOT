In the course of hypnotic demonstrations, one might produce some visual aberrations which make the subject believe that, out there, there are some beings and objects that are non-existent in the view of everyone else. It is for instance possible to persuade a subject that ahead of him runs a river where he can thus fish, whereupon he will automatically adopt the attitude that is congruent with such belief. Yet perceptive aberration is not solely confined to hypnotic demonstrations. Several modifications of our perception of reality are less quotidian in their incidence and thus less pervasive, even if we might fail to realize them. Take, for example, the so-called “projection” as defined by psychology, as it is precisely one such illusion. The possible consequence thereof is that a person, instead of seeing a traffic cop in front of him, that is, a human person exactly like him, might well be seeing the image of his father. He accordingly reacts by acquiescing in a fine exactly as he used to be the recipient of some shouting when he was small.
