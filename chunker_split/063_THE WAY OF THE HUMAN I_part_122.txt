This is quite difficult because our minds at this level are a by-product of the nervous system and continually create associations, over and over again The external world is the dimension of reality which deals with people, objects and things. For example, the reality that if I jumped out of my apartment window, theprobability is that my physical body would be badly hurt. That is a high probability in the external world, regardless of what I believe. Another probability is, if I want to buy something, I have to have enough money to pay for it. If I walk out of a store without paying, then there probably will be consequences. The external world is the external world. It exists. It is the lack of the acknowledgment, the fixating on one dimension or confusing it for another or trying to overcome and even heal one dimension with another which can cause the loss of awareness and pain The external world is simplyâ€”there's a chair, there's a person, understand there's a context which rules each culture. In this world, we often don't experience things as they really are.
