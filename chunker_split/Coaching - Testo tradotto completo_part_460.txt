In order to build a sixth sense, an intuitive business acumen, it is necessary to undergo a process of accumulating a type of experience pursuant to which our unconscious mind learns to have instinctive financial “insight”. Many operations, moreover, are sufficiently logical, which means that a trading system might prove to be of great benefit to us with regard to their execution. An underlying strategy has to be developed. Defining one's Objectives in a positive way Why have you decided to engage in trading? What has induced you to take that decision? Usually, the goal shared by all traders is the one of earning a lot, quickly and by avoiding the need to strive too hard.
