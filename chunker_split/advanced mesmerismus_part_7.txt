Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh.
