Quantum Psychology would say the process is a function of the nervous system to abstract, project and spiritualize (if necessary) as a way to explain (organize) the chaos of and "survive," in this case, the shock of separation. You did nothing wrong. Are you a bad sinner which is why you are separate from God (Morn)? Do you imagine you were cursed? Were you thrown out of the kingdom of heaven? No. Your nervous system simply created a story, and religion to "get back to Morn/ God. God does not have a nervous system. To think that God has a nervous system with wants, volition, preferences, etc., is anthropomorphic (the process of projecting human qualities onto something which does not even possess a nervous system). For example, it is anthropomorphic to think He (Dadâ€“+God) was displeased because you were bad and now you must be punished and, henceforth, prove your worth(overcome your False Core) to reach oneness or nirvana (merging with him) again.
