Drivers are indeed appreciated precisely because of this capacity which enables them both to have a strategy for driving and to be simultaneously alert to the faintest noises, movements etc of the car. The same principle lies behind power as it is experienced in everyday life. Most people have power in the small things and thus succeed, the way a child would do, in obtaining what they want from others by being insistent, although that might not be what they truly desire, and is other than what they want in life. Any such person spends his existence in single isolated moments which are detached from a continuous form of self-consciousness. He switches from joy to sadness, breathlessly panting in the pursuit of something he has forced himself to achieve. At the end of the road, he realizes that he has not lived existence, but that he has rather been lived by it. We lack power because we lack consciousness. The more, however, we increase consciousness, the greater the power we come to have, whereupon we might actually live out existence.
