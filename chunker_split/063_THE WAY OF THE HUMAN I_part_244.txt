With this understanding, the "act of meditation" can be seen at best as a preparation for the no-state state; and at worst as medication or a spiritualized defense and compensation for the break in the BIOLOGICAL CORE–the False Core. Unfortunately, the technique of sitting straight is seen as a spiritual should, something to be done by an "I". For this reason, Yogis often use their outer muscles (their sleeve, i.e., compensating identities) to create and hold themselves up, with effort straightening the spinal columt‘ Because it is done from the "sleeve" with effort rather than the BIOLOGICAL CORE which is effortless, it becomes counterproductive thus creating more thoughts and reinforcing the False Core and the compensating False Self Identities, and bringing forth yet more thoughts and more psychological breakages in a vicious circle. Moreover this "forcing' of the back and spinal column to be straight reinforces the psychological breakages since it reinforces the "sleeve" (external muscles) or False Self (psychological sleeve). Biological and psychological breakages can be seen as a metaphor for the term splitting off in object relations therapy.
