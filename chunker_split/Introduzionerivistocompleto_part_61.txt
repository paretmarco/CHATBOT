(Henry Miller) COMPROMISE ANALYSIS, PSYCHOSYTHESIS & PNL In compromise analysis, the personality is divided into three fundamental parts: the parent, the adult and the child. Human behavior is interpreted as a continuous interaction of these three parts; in a healthy personality, the three parts make collective decisions, each part taking into consideration the needs of the other. Conflicts arise when the parts start to act to their own advantage. At this point, the therapist observes the subject’s behavior and classifies it according to one of the three sub-divisions. This happens naturally when using the child, parent and adult metaphor, therefore, the client’s behavior is inscribed within the model. Although compromise analysis demonstrates the same formal models as other therapies, it uses NLP techniques, such as “anchor casting” or disassociation. This also counts for pyschosynthesis which basis its work on reframing, another NLP subject. However, as with compromise analysis, it splits the personality into various sub-personalities and if these are in conflict with each other, the client will show external incoherent behavior. This means that there is a struggle for control, therefore, the therapist’s work consists of mixing the parts that are in conflict and of synthesising the sub-personalities into one. When discussing pyschosynthesis we talk about a kind of controlled psychodrama, where the therapist can persuade the client to mentally occupy theatrical roles, allowing the different actors in the scene to express their individual intentions. So, we can say that there are identical process models in every therapeutic technique, all pointing to the same final result.
