The eye is, moreover, the sensory organ that is most closely related to light, which is an element that is fundamental to life [15]. The eye is an essential organ of man, both as regards his life and his distinct individuality. We can discern both the following in the traditions that relate to this organ: • An attention that is extended to each one of the two eyes, which are related to pairs of opposite principles (sun and moon, male and female, etc); • An attention which is focused on the point between the two eyes, seen as a central locus and as the point in which intuitive faculties might be developed. In the practice of fascination through the look, both these elements are of significance, due to the fact that the median point between the eyes is one of the points which were traditionally used in order to observe this point itself. We are now going to pay notice to how we are capable of coming across these very same elements in different civilizations. According to the ancient Egyptians, for instance, the eye of Horus might be both the right eye and the left eye.
