For Quantum Psychology, this is not a world of Gods and Goddesses, but of ONE INDIVISIBLE SUBSTANCE. 3) The breakages in the BIOLOGICAL CORE 145 The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness (Quantum Psychology would say breaks in awareness of your BIOLOGICAL CORE) create the illusion of a separate "I" and "you" which, when identified with, prevents realization of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: THAT ONE SUBSTANCE cannot be divided or separated. Rather, the images of separation and division (which are your psychology) are created by the body (nervous system) as a survival mechanism (i.e., a learning device so that it can "never happen again"). Simply stated being in the world is what the biological function and BIOLOGICAL CORE are about. This occurs naturally and spontaneously without psychological considerations when the core is realized and the False Core dismantled. When you lose awareness of your BIOLOGICAL CORE, the "I" gets fixated in the thinking or emotional dimension and feels disconnected from the body and from the world, and hence, the Underlying Unity. When you are aware of your BIOLOGICAL CORE, a natural body bliss is experienced.
