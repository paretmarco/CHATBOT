Refer in this regard to the instructions applicable to the next exercise. Exercise 2 Take a business card and, at the back thereof, sketch the contour of a large coin. Thereafter, blacken the whole of the inside with some China ink leaving a strong mark, save for a minuscule little circle in the middle you are going to leave it white. Thereupon, affix the small cardboard piece onto the wall at your eyesâ€™ level, while you remain seated. You should set your self at a distance of some half a metre, which will then need to be increasingly reduced. Focus your look firmly upon the central white spot for a minute. During this period, no effort should be spared to avoid lowering the pupils of your eyes. In the event that you are gripped by an irresistible desire to lower them, you ought to engage in the opposite muscular effort, that is, striving to lift the pupils. Once you have mastered how to effortlessly stare at the disk for half a minute, you should then gradually extend the session until you can manage to fix your gaze on the disk for 15 to 20 minutes.
