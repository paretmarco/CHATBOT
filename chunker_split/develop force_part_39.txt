So while you work, think to the exercise, not to “the performance of the exercise”. Please consider this sentence, because the secret of success is wrapped in it. Memento. – Do not get exhausted in an effort to unduly prolong an exercise. At the beginning, when an exercise has been perfectly executed for a very short time, you can call yourself satisfied. Rather than prolong the duration for that day, you shall switch to a different exercise. Exercise 8 – arm folding Bend the arm on itself to touch the shoulder with your hand. Execute the movement slowly, controlling it, namely placing your attention on what you are doing and without any external thought. A similar exercise is well performed only when the mind does not distract, not even a moment. The brain must give sufficient impetus to the movement; attention has to follow this movement until the end. When you have learned to perform well in this exercise, practice it progressively for 2, 3, 4, 5 times. Alternate arms; perform the same by bending the leg on the thigh. Exercise 9 - The finger. Sit comfortably, one hand on the knee, keeping it closed except the middle finger that you will lengthen in the direction of the thigh. Raise and lower the finger slowly for 10, 15, 20 times. The exercise consists in not letting your attention ever detach from the swinging finger, this for longer each time. Exercise 10 - The funnel.
