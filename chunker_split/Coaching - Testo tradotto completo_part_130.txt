It is then that reality appears to be livelier, and it is then that we become capable of truly making decisions. It is only at that point, therefore, that we might become able to determine our purposes and bring them to fruition. The average man is "devoured by the mental side", i.e. he is caught in worries, cogitations and automatic reflexes. Yet a deeper basis does exist. This basis consists in a state in which we perceive reality as it truly is. We might draw a simile with the way we feel during a trip to a foreign country. In such a context, in fact, we are usually more present than is the case when we are in our own motherland: Sounds appear to us to be stronger and sensations more real. We are more ourselves because of the fact that the new environment stimulates our sensory aspect. When people speak of man utilizing only a part of his true potential, they have this in mind. Pressing forward entails a transformation of oneâ€™s own being which simplifies living and makes it more immediate, as it becomes more conscious.
