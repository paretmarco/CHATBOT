The mind operates all the time. The one who is always engrossed in useless things and is dissatisfied when the final curtain is drawn on his life is he who lets himself be led by the activity of his mind without being able to dominate it. Since the mind must be busy by fixing its sight upon some object, it tends to fix itself here and there by following the line which offers the least resistance and by dropping its attention as soon as it is on the verge of producing something which is wholesome but bound to require some straining effort. Whenever that happens, that kind of mind jumps to a different object, and from there passes onto yet a third one. Everything, whatever its nature, distracts the person with such a mind, and his senses are always protruded as if they consisted in five doors that are thrown wide open to each and every external vibration. The person concerned, therefore, ends up spending his day in a kind of unconscious state, and is only engrossed away from it by physiological needs or by habits which, due to their intrinsic nature, are similarly unconscious.
