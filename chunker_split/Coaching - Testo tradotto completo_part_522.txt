At the start of his career, a manager must rely instead on the experts in management theory, precisely like the trader has to lean on the advices of the more experienced traders and on available trading systems. In order to score a goal in this world, we should base ourselves on our instinct, exactly as it is done by football champions. In his last book "Blink", Gladwell puts forward the view that the best choices are those which are made in the "blink of an eye". The blink manager is a person who has witnessed many things and who has learnt a lot, to the point where he has educated his unconscious to follow his instinct. A good analogy is the one that might be drawn with football: A successful player does not consciously think of the decisions he needs to take in order to put the ball at the back of the net. He scoops from years of experience which have empowered him to hone his skills of judgment, until his judgment has become exceptionally sophisticated: The final outcome of that is scoring a goal.
