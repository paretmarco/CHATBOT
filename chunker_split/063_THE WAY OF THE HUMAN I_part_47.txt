Because the "NOT-I-I" is the WITNESS it knows and is aware of the VOID. The dimensions of manifestation end here (Volume III). This occurs because in the underlying unity of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE also called UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS even awareness itsetfdissolves. This is why noted physicist, John Wheeler, said, "Nothingness is the building block of the universe." The VOID or UNDIFFERIELVTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or the SELF is beyond Awareness, and is pure UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or THAT (not to be confused with consciousness as in I-Thou). The NAMELESS ABSOLUTE is beyond the VOID and is where the VOID itself ends. BEYOND IS JUST BEYOND Please note: In the following illustration, the vertical lines connect all the dimensions. This denotes that the dimensions interact and are connected even though they have different functions. The broken horizontal line indicates that there is a "relationship" above and below. But "you" cannot work on the areas below the biological dimension, i.e., ESSENCE, I AM, COLLECTIVE, and NOT-I-I. The solid line between VOID and NOT-I-I shows that the VOID and THE NAMELESS ABSOLUTE and BEYOND are not dimensions because everything, including awareness, disappears "there."
