To whom is interested only in non-duality, we answer that it is true that the final stage of the way towards non-duality passes through knowledge and overcoming of all mind condensations, including symbols. Nevertheless, before we get to that level, these are tools necessary and irreplaceable to who has spiritual purposes only. The first phase: To get started in this subtle domain of our imagination, or, to express it in hermetic terms, in the ability to fix our “mercury”, you can begin building images that appear in the relaxed mind, with closed eyes. The body must eliminate any tension. Any mental effort blurs mental images. However, this phase, we call it passive imagination, is only an initial step in which you do not have to indulge too much. In fact, if we stay too long in the passive stage, the ability to infuse an impulse to our unconscious is becoming increasingly weak, and we end up with appearing images dominating us. We enter in a negative trance where imagination reigns. We risk to take the mood of the “peaceful dreamer” type. Second phase: The positive trance is the next step. It is more tiring, and consists of imagining whatever you want to. It is the union between will and imagination. It is then a first level of realization of the Hermetic Caduceus. • Remember that the images you create are totaling, in other words, when we speak of “imagination”, we mean something that is both visually and aurally, both tangible and perceptible.
