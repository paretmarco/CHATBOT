The totality of observables is defined in quantum terms as making up a "quantum register". We might imagine a large notebook containing a great many pages. We are pleased with the fact that all the pages are all equally filled with writing. In an identical way, a balanced register enables the mind to function better. Which are, then, the essential elements a trader ought to work on? The first three fundamental elements which a trader should start building, and which represent three "observable" elements, are the following: Bullish Direction Bearish Direction Lateral Direction These same principles might be easily generalized and thus extended to every situation. If I want to set up a trading system enabling me to trade in a bullish market, my mind is in fact compelled to think in terms of a bullish trend. The visual angle of bullish people is accordingly orientated in favour of promptly detecting certain signals of the system which differ from those characterizing a bearish market. We must start learning the art of creating a trading system for all three main directions of the market. In that manner, we will also learn to reason things out on the strength of a different mentality and different viewpoints.
