She was already in her age- regressed-child trance. The only way the small child could handle the bombardment she had to deal with was for the ob- server to develop a trance called illusioning, futurizing, and fantasizing. The child said, "Someday, it's going to be better." A similar example might be a young boy who wanted to be a professional football player, but by the time he was 13, had given it up because of feedback from the world, i.e. he didn't make the team. He then wanted to be a basketball player. Since he was too short, he gave that up. He accepted feedback in present time a connection to the world, and integrated. When a person is in present time, he can allow and integrate feedback from the world. The individual will let go of illusions. Lack of feedback solidifies illusions. When the child cuts off feedback (family or world) to survive, illusions become more solid Illusioning â€¢ 87 and the intensity of the need not to see the family situation increases.
