A little later I chose to suggest to this subject that a tiger pounced upon him. He immediately made a touching gesture of unspeakable terror. In Paris in 1881 Mounet-Sully the greatest French tragedian, having assisted in my séance, wrote me a long letter in which he said: "If your experiments are not real, your subjects are comedians of genius worthy of being engaged at the Comédie Francaise ; for neither the great Talma nor the prodigious Frederic Lemaitre could equal them." Jules Claretie director of the Comedie Francaise, made a similar declaration in Le Temps; and Sara Bernhardt confessed herself incapable of assuming the attitudes and ecstatic expressions which I suggested to four lady friends of hers at a stance improvised by the celebrated painter Louise Abbema. A young subject wishing to lift a newspaper is made to believe that the paper weighs fifty pounds, and he exhausts himself in his effort. The imaginary weight drags him down and would make him fall did I not restore the lost equilibrium by pressing my hand on the opposite shoulder. At Bordeaux in 1887 in presence of all the press, I prevented Lawyer X (whose name I have forgotten), the most robust man in the city, from lifting a handkerchief.
