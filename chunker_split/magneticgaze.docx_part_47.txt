Exercise 23 – Gather your attention in the middle Take a makeup mirror, and fix the black spot within the white circle with such an intensity that it is as if through it you were looking at the brain. Do that with each eye in turn for four seconds, whereafter you will stare at the median point situated between your eyelids. Exercise 24. The vowel “eee” This particular exercise lends the sight a magical strength. It is sufficient if you were to calmly look at yourself in the mirror and then breathe deeply and slowly, until you eventually feel calm and harmonious, at which point you pronounce the vowel "eee"[28] so long as there is air in your lungs. You must feel the sensation that your whole head is oscillating at once. This exercise massages the nerves of your eyes and the whole skull in a very powerful manner. [29] Exercise 25. The look of the glands Erase the spot you had previously drawn on the mirror, and fix the look on your own self, moving ever more closely forward. In doing so, you should look at yourself by the corners of your lachrymal glands.
