ideals and directions Minor plans ? specific objectives As we draw up the yearly plan, we should pay regard to the program which has to be carried out in consonance with one's age, health, means, etc. It would be absurd to allocate, for example, the goal of being successfully appointed as member of parliament to the age of 20 years, assuming of course that such objective formed part of the life planâ€™ and it would likewise be absurd to exclude, from the plan for that age, the fulfilment of love-related aspirations, reserving all of them to the plan concerning the 70th year ! 56. Due to all the aforesaid reasons, while we might intelligibly retain all the supreme ideals linked to our overall lifetime, it will also be of practical relevance to successfully implement some minor plans comprising minor ideals, and to do so for longer or shorter periods, the extent of which should be left to contingent circumstances to determine. For example, a student might delineate his plan until the stage of his graduation, an artist might do so until the successful completion of a particular program, and the same would hold true of a merchant, a manufacturer, etc.
