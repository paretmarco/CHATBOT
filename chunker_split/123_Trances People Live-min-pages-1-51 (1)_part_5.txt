In Trances People Live Dr. Wolinsky has made a unique project of combining his six years in the Far East studying their world with his 20 years as a therapy student studying our world. This unique integration makes his background for writing about firicksonian psychotherapy, historic psychotherapy. Add to this some Eastern philosophy as well as Western religion and physics, and you've got, a fascinating piece of literary choreography. In Trances People Live the author presents a new conceptual framework for trance which translates into a comprehensible, psychotherapeutic, organized way of looking at daily life as a process of trance. Very exciting. H is concept ofeveryday psychology as a process of self-induced trance is a wonderful way to begin.
