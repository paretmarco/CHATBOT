153-154) If we use the metaphor of a string, it can be said that the vibration and harmony of each string creates Forces and Physics Dimensions which, like the prism forming a rainbow, creates what we call archetypes and a "personal me" and a "personal you" out of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or NOTHINGNESS. Or as Nisargadatta Maharaj said, "In the beginning there was NOTHING ABSOLUTELY, the I AM appeared 87 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology (through condensation), and one day this I AM will thin-out and there will be NOTHING AGAIN." QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Nisargadatta Maharaj said, "The I AM comes from the COL- LECTIVE" (a play or interaction of the Physics dimensions). This means that the basic I AM which precedes all we call ourselves, and even the "you are," are also Archetypes or a combination of the Physics Dimensions (Rainbow) through the Super strings (Prism) and which arise out of a condensation of the NOTHINGNESS or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. As mentioned earlier, whether string theory is right or wrong is inconsequential.
