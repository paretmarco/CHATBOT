For example, we have gastric erethism when the papillae of the stomach are stimulated by the juices which require food to be elaborated, when, to put it simply, we feel appetite. At that point we are more alert, more active. We feel well when we realize that our balance sheet contains some spare energy, in precisely the same way as a commercial sheet is deemed good when it shows a net positive amount. We have a muscular erethism when our muscular fibre, well nourished and rested, asks to engage in some physical exercise; in other words, when, to give an illustration, the legs naturally set themselves in motion, so to speak, when we would gladly jump around a bit, race for a while or relish a somersault. Erethism, therefore, always derives from a surplus of available strength.
