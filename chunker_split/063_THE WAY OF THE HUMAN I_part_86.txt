In other words, the judgmental observer is part of and re-enforces the system In this way, "you" (the observer-False Core-False Self) become attracted to a system which claims you can convert vices into virtues (Christian overlay) or unhealthy into health (psychological/societal overlay). People "act out" their False Core-False Self continually because they imagine they are their False Core-False Self. If you believe that you are your False Core, then you'll think that by changing this belief (transforming it in some way), you are changing yourself which is actually the False Self in action. When you realize that you are not your False Core, that you were there before your last thought, and after that thought leaves you will still be thereâ€”when you realize that, you can go beyond your False Core, understanding that changing thoughts and feelings don't have anything to do with changing you. In fact this approach of focusing on changing thoughts or feelings, as if they change you, is a seductively "dangerous" distraction if your wish is to find out WHO YOU ARE.
