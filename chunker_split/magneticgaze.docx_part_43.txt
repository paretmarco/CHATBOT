It is at this juncture that the problem emerges: How can we possibly perpetuate the expressiveness of our eyes? To a great extent, this question is solved by the exercises that we have been listing up to now. A pair of healthy, vigorous and fast-moving eyes is full of charm on that ground alone. This is nonetheless insufficient. We want to regale our eyes with that inward fire which is a telling indicator of a fervent soul. It is here that the problem defines itself. It is clear that a young lady might not desire a dominant, Napoleonic look for herself, at the same time that a soldier or a businessman will certainly have no inclination to possess a normally voluptuous look. Every one should accordingly pose the following question to his or her own self: — Which expression am I going to bestow upon my eyes? The said question might in turn be subsumed under the one set out hereunder: — Which is the expression of the look that accords best with my physiognomy, my profession, my condition, the purpose I am seeking to accomplish? Each one of us can easily solve such problem, whereupon his efforts will be fully concentrated on acquiring the desired expression.
