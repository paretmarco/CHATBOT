For this level, the utilization of methodologies of self-hypnosis will prove to be highly beneficial, and in fact almost an indispensable necessity. Accessing such a higher level is premised, however, on the prerequisite of being balanced and following an orderly line in the choices one makes. What that essentially entails is the fact that the choice of practicing a trader’s activity should be based on a specific decision to attain self-fulfilment rather than on the mere advantage of working from home or earning quickly. In the realm of actual reality, it is impossible to function purely in a linear sense, since by operating that way we would be neglecting several elements, and would fail to make use of our intuitive acumen. If there existed, in fact, an automatic way for scoring gains, it would have been converted, sooner or later, into a software which all the traders in the world would have come to possess after a short while, whereupon we would be thrown back to our initial departure point. However, it is likewise impossible to operate only on the basis of “intuitive acumen”.
