Immediately thereafter, lift the arms as high above your head as it is possible, and look at your toes. Then bend down gradually, until, if at all feasible, you are able to touch the floor with your fingertips, without bending your knees in the process. Regain at that point an upright position, and let the arms fall down along your body while you exhale the air through the lungs. At the beginning, this exercise might cause you a sensation of vertigo, but it will actually cause you no inconvenience. The occurrence of such a sensation is only due to the fact that some areas of the body, especially by the region of the lungs, which had long been inactive, are now put to use. There is no exercise which is able to compel air to enter each and every particle of the lungs that can be compared to the one we have just described above. The implementation of this exercise will not take more than one minute of your time each morning, and only a few days will be enough to persuade the student of the extremely far-reaching benefits it is capable of securing.
