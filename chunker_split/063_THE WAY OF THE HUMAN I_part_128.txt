As I said before, if I solved all "my psychological problems" and wanted to open a clothing store on a street where there are many other stores, even if my psychology is clear and I'm focused, it might be a total flop. The old saying, "Do what you love and the money will come," demonstrates both the collapsing of the levels and a neglect for the external context. A more accurate saying would be, "Do what you love and if the external context supports it the money might(?) follow." The distortion is, "If I am clear about it and I want it, then I will get it," fuses together "wanting equals getting," as if wanting something had something to do with getting it. It's nice to be clear 73 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness about what you want, but you need to look at the context in which you are trying to manifest this since context is the major component in manifestation.
