The difference between the mind and my mind is very subtle. If you were to say "my mind," the assumption is that you are solid, and it belongs to you. Rather, there is the mind and there are thoughts. In this way it becomes easier not to fuse with thoughts. East Indian literature says that the key to freedom lies in renunciation. What do we mean by renunciation? Do you have to give up your desires or your feelings? No, but you have to give up your identification with the "I", "me" and "mine." This is true renunciation. In the same way, you have to give up identification with the mind (condensed VOID). The most important thing to understand is that the "I" will always run its tape. After I had lived in India for 5 years, people would leave and return but I'd still be there. After 6 years, someone came up to me and said, "You're going to be here forever" (as if l were someone special). "Actually, I'm leaving in June" I said.
