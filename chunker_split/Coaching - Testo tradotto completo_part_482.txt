For example, “difficulties” are only so because we call them that way. We can observe what happens when we begin to replace the word difficulty with such words as "circumstance" or "fact". “Difficulties” might be understood as no more than normal “situations” which are met along the path, and along the ordinary way in which one’s activity unfolds itself. As such, they are often capable of being solved by resorting to the logical type of reasoning we are perfectly able to carry out so long as we remain present. Another word which a trader uses so as to negatively hypnotize himself is the noun “investment”. When a certain stock does not yield gains, and yet the trader has a obstinately firm conviction that it is going to rise in value, he then calls it “an investment”. What should be done when, through our behaviour, we are unable to attain the goal we had initially set for ourselves? Whenever our conduct is incapable of achieving a demarcated intermediate objective, a difference is established between imagined reality and perceived reality, whereupon discomfiting hardships materialize.
