Health and vitality are the foundations for giving expression to thought in the realm of reality. By norm, thought, in order to be effective, must be consistent with one's will and must express itself, from a physiological point of view, in a manner which is inherently harmonious both at the level of the cerebrospinal system and at the one of the sympathetic nerve system. Put it concisely, the entire organism must act consistently. In this regard, both the Westerners and the Eastern people draw attention to the important role played by manâ€™s spinal column in such a process (This is the power of the vertical line). From a physiological perspective, the marrow bone acts as the channel through which thinking may be able flow, by broadcasting it to the nervous system, and by simultaneously dispatching that information to the brain. Moreover, in accordance with the Indian tradition, a number of special energy areas (called chakras) are situated along the spinal column, and once such energy areas are activated in a coordinated fashion, they enable energy to manifest. Lastly, a far-reaching significance is enjoyed by the use and training of one's look.
