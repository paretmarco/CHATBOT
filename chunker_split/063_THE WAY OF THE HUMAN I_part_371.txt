This is certainly the ultimate in giving an inanimate object the power to make you healthy, wealthy and wise. Bollas (1987) writes that: Each aesthetic experience is transformational, so the search for what Krieger terms the 'aesthetic object' is a quest for the transformational object (mother). The 239 SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES What then are these spiritual experiences of union we are all seeking. Bollas (1987) again: In my view the aesthetic moment is an evocative resurrection of an early ego condition often brought on by a sudden and uncanny rapport with an object (mother), a moment when the subject is captured in an intense illusion of being selected by the environment for some deeply reverential experience. This holding experience sponsors a psycho-somatic memory of the holding environment. It is a pre-verbal, essentially pre- representational registration of the mother's presence. (p. 39). Transformational-object-seeking is an endless memorial search for something in the future that resides in the past. I believe that if we investigate many types of object relating we will discover that the subject is seeking the transformational object (mother) and aspiring to be matched in symbiotic harmony within an aesthetic frame that promises to metamorphose the self.
