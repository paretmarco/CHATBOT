For normal waking consciousness to exist, the synapse transmission frequency for the brain (v') must satisfy the condition: 2/3 v' must be greater than or equal to N /T where: N = The total number of synapses in the brain (in humans, about 5E11) T = Synaptic transmission delay time (the time interval required for the propagation of the excitation energy from one synapse to another) This theory ascribes consciousness to an association of the events occurring at any one synapse with events occurring at other synapses in the brain by means of a quantum mechanical propagation of information. The sense of individual identity is an aspect of the continuity of the wave matrix residing in the brain [4]. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND PSYCHOKINESIS By merely observing a phenomenon (resonating ones brain with it) one can affect the outcome, since the physical mechanisms in your brain are part of the wave matrix described by quantum mechanics. The information handling rate in resonance determines the amount of effect, along with the elapsed time of resonance and the probability distribution of the phenomenon you are observing [5].
