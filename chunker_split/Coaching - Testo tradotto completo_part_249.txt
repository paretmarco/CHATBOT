Ideally one should be able to tread a proportionally inverse path between professional activity and elective activity, in such a manner that, as we go on with our life, we progressively free ourselves from our professional activity and we are gifted the chance of consecrating ourselves to the elective one with stronger determination. One should, of course, avoid the risk of a program which is so crammed that it leaves him no spare time to devote to some casual or fashionable forms of culture we should always take care to be at least informed about: Reading newspapers or magazines, attending conferences, and so on. In short, what we propose to do for our own culture is the opposite of what is generally done at present. What is harmful is to waste time reading too many newspapers and magazines of no significance, tasteless novels, vulgar works, and, worse than all of them, the vice of browsing here and there at the first printed words which fall into our hands, or of losing ourselves in the news by watching over and over again the same information we have already become conversant with.
