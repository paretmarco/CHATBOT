170 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Sexual Tantra If sensations during sexual contact are experienced in a local- ized area (the genitals, mouth, breasts), the same spreading technique can be employed by allowing the sensations (in penis or clitoris) to spread through the entire body. Sex then becomes a means to enhance and increase energy throughout the entire system (body). The focus of attention and the inner absorption creates a reconnection of genitals to body that promotes a deeper sense of self. If this practice is continued, the utilized energy created through sexual contact allows successive plateaus to be reached, creating a deeper experience of self. It cannot be over-emphasized that this process requires the intention to not orgasm immediately but rather to increase the stimulation to bring about a deeper sense of connec- tion and orgasm. 5. Spaces between sensations: In handling pain, as mentioned before, the sensations are felt as one experience. The first set of suggestions involves requesting that, rather than one long sensa- tion, there be a sensation and then a space or gap, and then a sensation, and then a space. Usually what occurs is a throbbing feeling.
