ESSENCE initially appears and is (mis)perceived and hence (mis)labeled as an empty lack within the physical body. But once the labels (False Core-False Self) are removed, it is actually full of Essential qualities (love with no object, peace, compassion, unity, observation with no object, spaciousness, etc.). In Quantum Psychology, ESSENCE is the Fifth Dimension of awareness, the space around which the physical body is organized.' ESSENCE has often been referred to as an "individual soul." This is a mistake. ESSENCE is actually a condensation of the ONE GREAT SOUL or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. In other words, there is no separate individual soul, rather just one soul.' The (rnis)perceived, (mis)labeled space is viewed as empty as in a lack when actually unlabeled it is pure spaciousness. See The Tao of Chaos In India, a person who is aware of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE or THAT ONE SOUL is called a Mahatma: maha meaning great and atma meaning soul.
