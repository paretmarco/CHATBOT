Doing so step by step is simpler. It is like developing a muscle, as recently proven by a number of researches (See, for instance, those of Prof. Mark Muraven from Albany University 11). Being the master of yourself, however, in no way entails that you should abandon your own personality. It is quite the reverse. What it means is to recover what we truly are. Our personality as forged by deranged thoughts is a false personality, since it operates outside our control. By relinquishing the thoughts that are left uncontrolled, we recover our true self, which would otherwise be drowned by the wasteful slag of worries and anxieties 12. Do not let your thinking, therefore, roam about in the bleak regions of vacuous and incoherent fantasizing shorn of any beginning or final goal. Make sure that you set yourself a target, whether in dealing with your own selves or with other people. Do not say anything other than what you have in mind to utter and which is truly useful or indispensable to verbalize. Avoid reacting aimlessly. A useful stratagem might consist in introducing a “conscious silence” between a question and the answer thereto.
