A psychologist friend of mind was undergoing a D and C. Prior to receiving this procedure she identified some old emotional issues in her life and imagined that they were in her uterus. Receiving only local anesthesia, she imagined the procedure to be cleaning out her "old stuff," and reported she felt euphoric during the process. She created new meanings for the experience and remained discon- nected as she watched them from that perspective. 3. Disconnection: You can imagine yourself in a variety of different places, scenes, events, with people or alone, which discon- nect you from experiencing the present. As an example, a recent workshop participant complained of pain in the ear. She developed an image of a cave in her brain. This cave was a comfortable place to view the painful experience, thus disconnecting her from the pain. Other people I know imagine themselves in another place or time yelling angrily at someone they have been in conflict with. This disconnected them from the present-time pain. A client of mine receiving dental work reported that, while anticipating pain, she imagined herself talking to people with whom she was extremely angry. This distracted her enough for the pain not to be felt.
