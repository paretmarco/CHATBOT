There are an infinite number of observers which arise and subside with each experience, each experience containing a different observer. THE ILLUSIONS OF THE OBSERVER To explain further, there are three belief structures or illusions about the observer, or that the observer has about itself: I) it 'Quantum Psychology actually feels that Gurdjieff's objective consciousness is a quality of ESSENCE, i.e., observation with no object. 40 Chapter 11 observes and is separate from what it is looking at (not true); 2) it imagines that it creates what it's looking at (which it does not); 3) it imagines it came before or existed before that which it is observing (which it does not). These are underlying structures contained within the observer which must be gone beyond. As long as the observer is there, the False Core-False Self will be there because it too is part of this holographic unit. This is why Quantum Psychology writes it using hyphens: observer-False Core-False Self, as one unit. Trying to separate the observer fronythe False Core would be like trying to separate the smell of a rose from the rose.
