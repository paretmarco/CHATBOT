Ocular desensitization technique This technique is useful as reinforcement after having carried out the cinema technique. Go to the event that produced the phobia and take a mental photograph. Place the photo on your finger. Move your finger from left to right to the sound of circus music. Repeat until you eliminate it. Anxiety Techniques Anxiety is an idea not a reality!!!!! We are in fact anxious for things that have not yet happened and probably never will! PROCEDURE Go beyond the time line into the future, after the positive conclusion of the event. Feel the sensation. Come back to the present. If the anxiety does not disappear, then you will need to restructure it: “I know there is a part of you that thinks that it is important to have a little bit of anxiety to motivate yourself and I agree that it is important to be motivated, the problem is that anxiety isn’t good for the body. Are there other ways in which it is possible to be motivated and let go of the anxiety?” Some people, instead of motivating themselves with positive thoughts, motivate themselves with negative ones. The above technique can be also useful to change this. MOTIVATING YOURSELF WITH FEAR IS NEGATIVE BECAUSE IT IS DESTRUCTIVE “Fear knocked on my door, faith opened the door and there was no one there”.
