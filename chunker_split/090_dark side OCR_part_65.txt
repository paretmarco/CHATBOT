A person finds himself in the future. Frequently, clients complain of anxiety, (fear of the 40 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child future). All too often, this fear of the future is actually fear of an imagined future. For example, I am in a relationship and feel "in love." I go away for business for a week and imagine my girlfriend having an affair. As the fantasy continues, I futurize myself coming home several days later, moving to my own apartment and being alone and unhappy. The odd part about futurizing is that I feel the pain of the imagined situation right now, even though it is a fantasy of a catastrophic future. 1. Catastrophizing In the cognitive therapy of Albert Ellis, he categorizes one style of futurizing: catastrophizing. "Catastrophic thoughts often start with the words what if. What if my daughter gets pregnant? What if I lose my job? What ifI get sick and can't work?" (McKay, 1981:21) Catastrophizing, which is one style of futurizing, takes place when a person projects herself into the future and imagines a catastrophic outcome.
