This dark side of the frozen inner child sets up internal, subjective experi- ences, some of which are based on present time information, but some of which are just free floating illusions from the past, that confuse, interfere with, and misinterpret present time reality. In selective trances, the child within selects what was, or occurred in the past, and overlays it on the present or future. For example, a child whose father was dysfunctional is told by his mother (the hypnotist) how much Dad cares because he remem- bered a birthday, rather than acknowledging that Dad's been drinking every day this month and just happened to do one nice thing. Years later, the child within the adult marries an alcoholic and selects the one nice event and magnifies it. This selective trance mirrors the earlier trance suggested by Mom. In illusioning, what is seen is not there, or more commonly, what is there is magnified as if it were the whole picture. It is similar to its complement, blocking-out, in that both trances require a shrinking of the focus of attention.
