Initially he referred to Donata as ‘a professional magnetizer’, although a little later he wrote that Donato was a ‘hypnotist’, which he was not, he was a Magnetic Fascinator. But despite Moll’s misinterpretation he went on to write, ‘As I saw in Paris, Donato uses a particular process to bring about this state. This process aims at a primary forced contracture of all the muscles of the body, in order, by this means to limit the voluntary movements as much as possible. In this case the eyes of the hypnotist and the subject are firmly fixed on one another. The subject finally follows every movement of the experimenter. If he goes backwards, the subject follows; he if comes forward, the subject does the same. In the same way the latter imitates every movement of the experimenter, only on the condition, that he knows he is intended to do so. We see here, as in the above third experiment, that fascination may be a primary form of hypnosis. But it can also be originated secondarily out of the other hypnotic states; and that is more usual. When the experimenter has hypnotized the subject in some other way, and has him open his eyes, he can fix his own steadily on them, and thus induce the same phenomena. A variety of this fascination is to fix the eyes of the subject on some other object – for example, on the finger of the experimenter.
