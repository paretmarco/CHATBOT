This first method is very similar to the one we have described at the stage of mentioning instant hypnosis within the field of providing solutions to a series of symptomatic signs. There is, nevertheless, an even more complete system, one which is accessible to one who works on himself. As regards Mesmer, after he moved to France he further expanded his working methodology. In order for him to achieve that, he pursued a program of working on his own self which he implemented for a period of three months, and which he described as "thinking without words". That way, by abandoning conceptualizations, he discovered how senses become sharper and “the form of objects renews itself”, and he felt “a powerful calm and the conviction of having been successful”. It is precisely here in France that he began to talk of “sixth sense”, mentioning in the process the fact that such sense could only be understood by experiencing it. [41] If we want to translate it into modern terms, we would assert that he reached a different state of consciousness in his work, such that his patients were able to detect it in his look and access it themselves in turn.
