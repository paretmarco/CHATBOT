Quantum Psychology differentiates between an archetype and a personification in the following way: a personification is a creation which occurs when "not knowing" creates chaos. For example, for thousands of years no one knew what caused the wind to blow and this "not knowing" might create the internal experience of discomfort or chaos. To handle this chaos, people became anthropomorphic and might create a Wind God. They would then pray to and worship this new God (personification) created out of their unconscious desire to organize the chaos of "not knowing" the scientific facts about what wind is. This God, depicted as a person, is a personification and anthropromorphic. Archetypes, on the other hand, come directly from the EMPTINESS.

As it condenses further, energy patterns are formed 263 The Way of the Human Â® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness and as it condenses still further, archetypes are created. An archetype is a condensation of the EMPTINESS or Quantum field, and originates in the collective.
