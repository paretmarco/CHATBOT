21 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness External Dimension Thinking Dimension Emotional Dimension Biological Animal Dimension Chapter 11 on ESSENCE. ESSENCE is always there; the VOID is always there. But "you" can work on dismantling your fixated Awareness. MULTI--DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS DISMANTLING VS. TRANSCENDENCE Nisargadatta Maharaj said, "You cannot let go of something until you know what is is." Often spiritual systems are more into transcendence (trying to go beyond) and not dismantling. In many "Spiritual" traditions there is an idea that if I repeat my mantra enough and meditate enough, I will transcend the ego or mind, and I won't be identified with it any longer. This "Spiritual" theory is that through mantra, yantra, or tantra, you can go beyond the mind or somehow change your "vibration" in order to stabilize awareness in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., without having to recognize how your awareness is chronically fixated. As we will see below and in Volume I, this rarely works, is confusing and, in addition, collapses all of the diniensions.
