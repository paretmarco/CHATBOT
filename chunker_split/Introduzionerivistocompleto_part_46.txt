With the term autogenous training, J.H. Schults defined a method of self-extension that allowed the altering of mental and somatic situations. Training means the gradual learning of a series of passive, mental concentration exercises. Autogenous means something that is generated by the self and it is this characteristic that differentiates this method from those of hypnotic and self-hypnotic techniques, for in these methods mental and somatic modifications are actively induced. It is a scientific method of autosuggestion, a type of Western yoga that produces a general feeling of relaxation that helps to re-charge and restore body and mind. It has the scope of achieving a hypnotic state, therefore, under this aspect it can be seen as a self- hypnosis method. “Autogenous training is the art of self discovery”.
