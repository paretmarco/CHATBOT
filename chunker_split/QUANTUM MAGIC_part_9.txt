According to Evan Harris Walker, quantum mechanical state selection can be biased by an observer if [5]: W te is greater than or equal to -Log P(Qo-Qi) Q 2 where: P(Qo-Qi) = Probability that state Qi will occur by chance alone W = Information handling rate in process in brain Q associated with state vector selection (bits/sec) te = Elapsed time Q = Overall state vector Qo = Initial physical state of system Qi = State that manifests "paranormal" target event The effect of consciousness is incredibly small on macroscopic systems; but it can be measurable when it occurs on quantum mechanically defined and divergent systems, where a slight change can amplify itself as it propagates through the system. The effect is about 1E-17 degrees on the angle of the bounce of cubes going down an inclined plane. Changes in the angle of bounce result in changes in displacement of the cubes that increase about 50% on every bounce, and the effect is measurable after many bounces [6]. The theory successfully and quantitatively modeled the differing amounts of displacement observed in experiments on cubes of different weights and weight distributions [5].
