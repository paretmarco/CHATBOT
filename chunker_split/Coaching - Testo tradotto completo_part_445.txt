By virtue of the impact of media, a large number of people decide to buy or to sell at the same time, all together. The economic theory of a rational market is daily refuted by facts, since market movements are occasioned by the sum-total of emotional reactions coming from a multitude of different persons. An effective trader who earns well must necessarily know and understand these mechanisms, both in so far as they manifest in other people and in terms of how they manifest in his own self. He must have such knowledgeable comprehension of them as to free himself thereof and be accordingly able to function. The effective trader knows how to be present, and does not lower his attention because of emotion. The financial markets are ruled by hypnosis. What else, in fact, might be able to explain the phenomenon by virtue of which some traders incessantly repeat the same mistake, unless we refer to a narrowing of their attention field? In an identical fashion, how else, we may ask, can we explain the fact that even respectable institutions carry out actions which in the view of a less experienced observer as well might be judged to be more than merely audacious and risky?
