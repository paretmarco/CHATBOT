He opened the Institute in Nice and was able to get it officially recognised as a training facility for psychotherapists and hypnotists. But all was not well on a personal level. Max, his long-time friend, decided a year after they had opened the Nice Institute he wanted to give up teaching and seeing patients, and go and live a quieter and less hectic life. This meant Marco was left to run the Institute and carry on the training programmes they had started. Then in 2006 he began, for the first time, to train people in Mesmerism and the Fascination techniques and, at the time, by the end of 2011 he had trained mesmerists who had come from the United States, Germany, Australia, Canada, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Slovakia. He had also been invited to conduct Mesmeric training courses in the USA and Australia. And as each year passes, because Paret is a prolific writer more and more people, including a small number of doctors, are beginning to realise Mesmer was not a scoundrel, fraud and charlatan and has made a definite contribution to the healing practice of medicine. It has taken a long time to achieve the truth about him and his work, but Mesmer knew this would happen, despite a doctor saying on British television in February, 2012 that any doctor practising ‘Alternative medicine’ was a disgrace to the medical and should be removed from the medical register and barred from practising medicine.
