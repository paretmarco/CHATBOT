THE CONTEXT What psychology has forgotten is that the context is larger than the individual. For example, a heroin addict can be taken out of 61 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness the context of his environment and he will stop shooting heroin. But put the junkie back and he begins to shoot drugs again. In our society, the context and continual media bombardment make our context even larger. Image has become more important than personal fulfillment, and what we possess and do more important than the discovery of WHO WE ARE. Even the strongest of us gets hypnotized and tranced-out by society and in the process we lose touch with our own human nature. In short the sizzle has become more important than the steak. In the 1970s, a terrifying film about violence and gangs forecasted the future. It was called A Clockwork Orange. I was fascinated when I read the book to finally understand the title: A Clockwork Orange is a person who appears human or organic (orange) but has actually become a machine (clock). This is the context in which we live. Waking up out of this context and the automatic reactions to it are part of becoming fully human.
