Exercises aimed at Relaxation and at Muscular Control Exercise 6 â€“ General Relaxation In order to implement this exercise, you should lie down on the bed and let go of yourself at once; alternatively, you should let yourself be carried by the chair, and rest on either support, the bed or the chair, as if you were an empty bag. After that, you must review each and every muscle in your body, starting with the muscles of the face (especially the eyes, the mouth and the tongue), and then go down bit by bit to your arms, the chest, the back and the legs. You must lift one arm and let it fall down suddenly, as if the joints of the shoulder, the elbow, the wrist and the phalanges were merely the strings of a net happening to interlink parts of your upper limbs. You should then do the same with your lower limbs. Check and eliminate the tension which is so common by the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and make sure you feel your spinal chord as something loose and mobile, as if it were a limp chord, rather than as a column made of iron.
