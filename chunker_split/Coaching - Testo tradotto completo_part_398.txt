In fact, however much your will to power might be strong, and however wide your cognitive grasp might happen to be, if you direct your look at a man all the time while the latter is addressing you in his speech, then, provided such man knows what needs to be done to turn the situation to his own advantage, he will no doubt end up influencing you. That is as certain as the fact that two plus two equals four. True, maybe you will not enact exactly what he would like you to do. True, it might happen that he is going to ask too much of you and you will accordingly turn him down. Nevertheless, in one way or another, he is going to have an influence on you. You might possibly concede to him certain things you would have denied his person if you had been in full possession of your faculties of reasoning. The man who pretentiously declares that no one is capable of influencing him is in fact totally ignorant about the laws in accordance with which human beings are influenced.
