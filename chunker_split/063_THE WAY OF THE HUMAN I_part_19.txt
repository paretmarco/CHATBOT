Instead, we should let the psychology be and do psychology, and let ESSENCE be and do ESSENCE. Moreover, these qualities we seek, like peace or unconditional love, are not the only part of our human nature but represent just one of its dimensions, namely ESSENCE. No dimension can be overcome or gone beyond in favor of another 4 Chapter 1 dimension if "you" wish to stabilize awareness in the underlying unity. For now, we can say that our ESSENCE has essential qualities, like unconditional love, or love with no object. This is, however only one part of human nature. For that reason, to try to deny our animal nature, or try to reprogram or recondition our thinking or emotional nature, is not to realize that our animal nature, or our thinking or emotional nature, has a different function than does ESSENCE. This trying to deny our animal human nature and make it more like ESSENCE is a distortion which leads to more confusion (i.e., like the body is bad), intraspsychic war, dichotomy, and more importantly, it keeps us from being fully human.
