Because Dad or Mom are the "outside" observers who are trying to reform your behavior, years later you have an observer who unknowingly is an internalized Mom and/or Dad observing and trying to reform "you" (turn vices into virtues), getting rid of the "bad" (what Mom and Dad don't want) and replacing it with good (what Mom and Dad, later spiritualized as God or Guru want) in order to merge and go to heaven. Since as an infant rewards and punishments were based on behavior judged good or bad, this fused internalized observer is actually Mom or Dad now internalized as an "observer" observing you. 41 The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You see and treat yourself the way Morn and Dad saw and treated you. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: When the observer is fused with Morn or Dad, behavior, emotions, etc., are viewed as bad, vices, sins, etc. You think getting rid of the bad is "spiritual" when actually it is an internalized age-regressed re-enactment of Mom/Dad as an observer observing you as a child, which has become internalized.
