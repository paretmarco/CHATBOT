Trance-ference should not be seen in the classic sense of an analyst analyzing a patient lying on a couch. In fact, let us put ourselves on the couch so we can see how we distort our perceptions of ourselves, the world, and our present-time relationships, and in the process lose our human nature. We lose our human nature when we lose the awareness of our present-time body, and the degree to which we lose awareness of our present-time body is the degree to which we trance-out and consequently lose our humanness. It is not that people "leave their body," but rather they lose awareness of their present-time body or leave their awareness of their present-time body, and with that they lose their humanity. We must understand that our body is necessary to have a relationship to our humanity and the underlying unity.
