THE HOLOGRAPHIC HUMAN: THE CONTINUUM To understand the continuum, compare the most solid thing in the body--our bones—to the less solid muscles, the less solid organs, the less solid emotions and thoughts. When we understand the holographic human continuum, Korzybski's organism-as-a-whole gives us a different view of the body/mind and its structure. 123 The Way of the Human 0 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness This holographic continuum could be illustrated thus: B ones—muscles--).organs—oblood—sensations—*emotions—othoughts (or vice-versa), all in one interconnected holographic whole. THE SPIRIT/SOUL IS THE BODY One of the most controversial—and, probably, one of the most crucial concepts to discuss is the assumption that there is a spirit or soul which is separate from the body. This idea is at the core of almost all religions. Hindus, for example, think of a soul, which incarnates again and again. Christians, although they do not think in terms of past lives, do talk of a future life for this soul or spirit in Heaven, if you're good, and Hell if you're bad.
