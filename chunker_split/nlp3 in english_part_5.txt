To hypnotize people, we have to create "rapport" involving them in the situation, bypass their abitudinary schema of references and reactions and then offer them a new direction. We can think to a person coming visiting a famous professor: this person will come in, and will be overhelmed by all the titles hanging on the wall of the office of the professor. This person will be ready to accept the directions from the professor: this person will have been hypnotized by all the elements present in the room. In a non verbal induction we will act upon the same lines, in a very easy and simple way. A BIT OF HISTORY Multisensory induction is the common way of inducing a trance in a lot of cultures. The use of not understable spells and symbols is very ancient. Magic words (words that a person cannot understand) are used in every magic ritual. The multisensory hypnosis is a way of using the principles behind these rituals for creating an induction fast and easy. We don't use magic symbols, but we create a very powerful enviroment through the right use of the non verbal communication. AN EXAMPLE OF A NON VERBAL INDUCTION WITHOUT WORDS It is really easier and faster to bypass the normal schema of references and reactions of a person with non verbal elements than with verbal elements.
