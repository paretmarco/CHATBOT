Quantum Psychology encompasses psychology and Eastern and Middle Eastern religions along with Quantum Physics. This context peitnitted "me" to outline what is The Way of the Human Â® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness called Quantum Psychology in Volumes I and II of the trilogy. In Volume III, however, not only multi-dimensional awareness (Volume I) and the False Core-False Self (Volume II) are gone beyond, but also awareness itself, along with Quantum Psychology, is dismantled and gone BEYOND. Before we get ahead of ourselves, however, it seems important, though perhaps unnecessary, to take this whole quest in stages. As we all know, this is not a linear process. On the contrary, we all get bursts of awareness, some coupled with experiences, some show us what is to come, or what is possible, and some take us beyond what we call ourselves. Hopefully, The Way of the Human, Quantum Psychology Notebooks (Volumes I and II) and Beyond Quantum Psychology (Volume III) can aid us in doing just that. It is for this reason that it is important to get an overview of what material each of the three Volumes contains.
