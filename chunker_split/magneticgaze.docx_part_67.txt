[39] A further scientific support for this theory and the useful benefit of re-enacting the symptom, to be immediately followed by a state of “void” where such symptom is no longer extant, being a result that can be achieved through fascination by the look, is provided by a research in the US we are going to make mention of. It is proven in this research that it is indeed possible to eradicate traumas without needing to intervene through a drug, opting instead to “write once more” over such trace of the memory and erase it. [40] Published in the Nature magazine, the successful realization of that research has been achieved by Elizabeth Phelps of New York University. In an earlier study, she had successfully tested the method on a number of small mice. It has been shown in the experiment that all one needs in order to wipe out an awfully frightening memory is by first recalling it. Thereafter, within a six hours’ time window, one writes over it a memory other than a scary one, exactly as it would happen if we were to tape over an existing recorded base.
