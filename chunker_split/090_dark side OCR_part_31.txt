It is 16 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child time to take the next step and dismantle this old world view. Last month, I was invited to give a presentation to a group of about forty psychotherapists on the East Coast. I asked the group, "Have any of you healed, or know anyone who has healed the wounded inner child?" There was no response. What we must find out is who is observing this inner child. In this way you the observer is empowered rather than the inner child. I said to the group, "Once you create a wounded child identity and decide to heal it by creating some other identity to say the right things to, combat it, re-assure it or champion it, you (the observer/ creator) must always keep the wounded inner child identity in your psyche so that you know what it is that needs to be healed. In order to take the next step and go beyond the inner child you must know its' dark side. My Indian teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj, would say, "First, you must know what something is in order to give it up."
