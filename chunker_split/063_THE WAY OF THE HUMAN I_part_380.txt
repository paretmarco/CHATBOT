They often say, "Don't come from scarcity." Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of gold, silver, oil, diamonds, etc. on the planet. This is a fact. For that reason, if some people have billions, many won't have anything. Furthermore, you cannot have all you want; you can have what you want given your IQ, genetics, natural abilities, looks, inheritance, external context, luck, etc. The Way of the Human at this level requires that you be honest with yourself and acknowledge and work with your limitations, rather than indulge your imagined grandiosity. SPIRITUAL TRANCES 1. I Am One with the Mother. In India, people are frequently disciples of the Mother. Notice how this can be a re-enactment of the symbiotic relationship the child has with their mother. 2. I Am One. Here, differentiation at one level is incomplete, which means that the person feels no separation and in life fuses with everything and everyone. The Way of the Human asks us to acknowledge all the dimensions of our humanness.
