If "you" can, hold- The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology onto the NON-VERBAL I AM and let go of everything else. If you can't, Hold onto the verbal I AM and let go of everything else. The NON-VERBAL I AM is without thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions. The verbal I AM is prior to I AM (fill in the blank). Nisargadatta Maharaj tried to cut the False Core-False Self at its roots, prior to I AM (fill in the blank) . To make that cut one must un-fuse the I AM from the False Core-False Self. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If there were no-body, then there would be no I AM. Eventually, you'll see that the I AM is also a concept, a universal Archetype (see next chapter). When the I AM disappears, it is a quantum leap. Nisargaddata Maharaj says, Once you believe I AM, then you believe "I am a man." "1 am a woman" and "I have all these things that I have to do." I believe "I need this and I need that." So cut it right at I AM.
