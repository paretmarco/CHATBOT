What one has to take care of is learning how to fix his attention on one SINGLE issue or problem for a progressively longer time. Some of the relevant exercises are set out here under. Exercise 10 – Bending the forearm Bend the forearm over your arm until you manage to touch your shoulder with the hand. Carry out the movement slowly, that is, by drawing your full attention to what you are busy with. Such an exercise will only be implemented properly on condition that, during its implementation, the adept’s mind avoids getting distracted even for a moment 25. The brain must supply the movement with sufficient impulse, while attention has to follow this motion until its full completion. Once you have mastered the proper implementation of this exercise, you should repeat it for a gradually larger number of times, 2, 3, 4, 5 times. Take turns between the two arms; and then carry out the same exercise, this time by bending your leg over the thigh 26. NB – At the beginning, all the exercises have to be short, as untrained people cannot expect to achieve too long a concentration. Exercise 11 – The finger.
