She said, "During the beatings." I suggested that leaving the body automatically was a defense against feeling the pain of the beatings, and not "spiritual." She cried saying, "It is the only hope I have." I said, "It was the only hope you had, but it is now creating problems for you in present time." This is an example of spiritualizing and disconnecting. The little girl disconnected from her body in order not to feel pain. But a part of her felt the pain and fused with the voice of her abusive stepfather, taking on his words and freezing them in her own head, resisting them and repeating them to herself over, and over, and over, yielding feelings of self-hatred. I wish to note she only saw me twice and it was not resolved in my office. I say this to emphasize that abuse is a serious issue and is not resolved by brief therapy. Severe abuse requires patience and knowledge on the part of the therapist, awareness and the ability to confront what occurred on the part of the client. 56 4.
