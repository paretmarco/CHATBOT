Yet another individual might accomplish the purpose more successfully by “denying his attention to any conscious thought”, and by driving ideas away from his self with the same calm persistence by which a horse would swing its tail in order to chase out the flies. The one who wants to go even further might seek to reach the absolute zero. It consists in the consciousness of the void, of the zero (0) state, namely, what Plato used to call the idea of all ideas 34. Our life, by contrast, is constantly pulled by the opposites which are symbolized by the pair plus (+) and minus (-). Such an essential underlying sapience can only possibly materialize beyond our thoughts, as the latter screen us from perceiving reality. To sum up, if we want to accomplish some immediately attainable practical purpose, we would say that our constant concern must consist in the art of utilizing our own forces all together, by directing their whole strength towards a single point.
