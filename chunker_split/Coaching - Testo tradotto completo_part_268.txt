Exercise 49 – This is a life habit which should be adhered to each and every morning. It is better to act by it as soon as our brain is awake, as our brain has not yet fallen back into the mechanisms by which it usually functions: It is thus possible, at that early stage, to easily issue to ourselves the instructions for that day. One of the most important things to do is to organize your time well. While you keep your eyes closed, and you maintain a steady state of relaxation, you should then devise a plan of action for the day. You must imagine yourselves achieving success in the actions you are going to undertake. Lastly, in the event that you want to additionally increase your level of efficiency when carrying out this exercise, you should take some deep breaths and think of the energy penetrating inside you as you inhale air. Do not overload the plan «in abstracto». Avoid, that is, the trap of creating fictional duties. You should rather create for yourselves real commitments (one must obligatorily have the mindset of being under a duty to will).
