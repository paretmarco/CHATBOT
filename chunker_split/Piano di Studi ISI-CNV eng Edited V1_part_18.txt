The course will mention also to various traditions and secret sealed western and eastern to which we had access staff to create this initiative and who are given the participants a basic key to understanding. All Traditions called "alchemy" in fact have at their heart the presence instantly as understood in this workshop. The course, developed, can also lead to the level of the so-called "philosopher's stone" of human transformation. The concept of "Alchemy of Light" is twofold. Both reconnects to what was said in the previous rows (hermetic tradition), and reconnects to the techniques where the light is a factor of help since it allows to facilitate understanding of certain processes allowing a better brain activation, although the presence and symbolic work remains fundamental. In order to attempt an explanation of the usefulness which light is regaled with, we are presently going to resort to a series of reflections based on modern quantum theory. The Universe is a whole. From this whole, our perception “exercises” some parts. The parts thus severed from the whole correspond to certain vibrational states of our neurons. In order to see a tree, for instance, the neurons of the visual cortex must be activated in a manner in which is different from the one that is needed when, to give an example, we discern a mountain.
