You must learn, in your surroundings, the signs which the Universe transmits to your persons, as well as the directions which open up in front of you with their peculiar vistas. Exercise 36 – Visualization Withdraw into a room, possibly a half-lit one, relax, and make sure you visualize a vivid picture of whatever your reflection happens to concentrate upon. Even though, the first times you carry out this exercise, it might seem as if you are reaping no results from it, creative ideas will gradually surface around you, and you will eventually end up acquiring a kind of «inner sight», such that it will be likely to rescue you from falling into gross mistakes. You might subsequently empower these sessions further by looking at the mirror thanks to the “reflected light”. Exercise 37 – Developing intuition by recourse to the mirror While you are in the same environment as the one referred to in the previous exercise, look for 30 seconds at a light (max. 75 watts) 47 which is reflected in a mirror, in so doing thinking of the subject matter concerning which you would like to find some inspiration.
