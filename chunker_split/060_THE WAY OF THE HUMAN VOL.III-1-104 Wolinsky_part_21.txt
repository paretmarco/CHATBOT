What does that nothing feel like? It feels free, light. Now, feel the free and light. Now, look at me. Feel the free and light. From the free and light, how does the False Core seem to you now? It is gone. This is different. I feel free, light and present. This feels more Essential somehow. DEMONSTRATION EXAMPLE #3 I am having a hard time "getting" ESSENCE. Notice the False Core. As you notice the False Core, ask the False Core and let it answer. "What is it that you are seeking more than anything else in the world?" Wolinsky:And so, if it felt acceptance, what would that feel like? Ted:Love. Wolinsky:And if you felt love what would that feel like? What is your experience like right now? Ted:I am love. DEMONSTRATION #4 Student:Can you do the Essential Core part with me? Wolinsky:What is your False Core seeking more then any- thing else in the world? Student:Well, the first thing that came up was love and then you said to stay with it, it was appreciation.
