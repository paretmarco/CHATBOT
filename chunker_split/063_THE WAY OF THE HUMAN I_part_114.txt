This is the nature of our inner work: confronting, dismantling and waking up to the larger context of who we are on all dimensions of reality and then going beyond them. This is The Way of the Human. CHAPTER IV THE DIMENSIONS OF "MANIFESTATION" F rom a Quantum Psychology perspective, it can be said that the Emptiness/Fullness of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE contracts or condenses. THAT ONE SUBSTANCE has been called the VOID, the EMPTINESS by Einstein and Buddha; GOD, in the Judaic tradition; and Shiva or pure (UNDIFFERENTIATED) consciousness by Hindu Yogis. It should be noted at this point that pure spirituality ends with the realization of THAT ONE SUBSTANCEâ€”I AM THAT (ONE SUBSTANCE). BEYOND is even beyond this and can no longer be called spiritual or spirituality as it is normally considered (see Volume III). THAT ONE SUBSTANCE (UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or EMPTINESS) condenses down fot ming the pure Awareness or Witness also called the NOT-I-I. Further contraction of the "NOTHING" forms what Carl Jung called "the collective unconscious." This Collective Dimension which contains Archetypes is that which comes "after" the pure awareness or the WITNESS (called the NOT-I-I.)
