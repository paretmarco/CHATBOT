In effect, Leonie, seized with fright, begged of me to give her back the use of her limbs. These facts and others of like nature which I will not mention, proved to me that the surest way to affect the imagination of a person, impose upon him a stronger will, consisted in working with the rapidity of lightning without giving him the time to reflect or recover his sang-froid. The reader knows those time-worn expressions: mute with astonishment, paralyzed with fear, dead with fright, petrified with admiration. They come to the support of my system. It is by surprising my subjects that I obtain paralysis, aphony, etc. without even trying to send them to sleep previously. My theory being definitely acknowledged as exact, it remained to me to invent the most efficacious process to obtain the most serious and practical results, for everybody is more or less apt to submit to the influence, though the measure is very variable, and the final success depends on the ability of the operator nearly as much as on the idiosyncrasy of the patient. After long studies I adopted several processes, which I use alternatively according to circumstances.
