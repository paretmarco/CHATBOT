However, what differentiates NLP is that it does not have any kind of subdivision and considers the individual in his/ her peculiar individuality, singleness and unity, having the ability to steer himself/ herself once s/he has learnt the relevant knowledge. Man is gifted with a mind that is able to invent the existence of time, space and conscience. S/he is an actor on a stage that s/he has constructed, complete with all the necessary accessories and scenes. Unfortunately, s/he does not realize the powerful instrument s/he has in his possession, in other words, the possibility to put “free will” into action or to be able to decide on what part he has on his own life stage. We live in a culture where other people program our brains or better still, where we in turn unconsciously program ourselves. So why do not we use this ability on ourselves when we are the first people in the world that we have to respect and understand? NLP’s key words are freedom, choice, self-control, autonomy, mental health and the power of communication based on feedback, in the sense that at the moment in which we communicate the other person has to interact with us. One of the corner stones of NLP is: “The significance of a communicative message is in the reaction that determines it”. I would like to highlight one more thing, which is that the instruments and techniques presented here all point to the “how” and “what” of the subjective experience.
