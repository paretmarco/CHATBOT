It is this destructive automatism which we are going to reduce progressively as we move on with the implementation of this method. A concrete illustration will clearly exemplify the interplay between these two distinct centres of one’s personality: A young student sits down at his desk early in the morning, so as to devote himself to some abstract philosophical problem which cannot distract him. Outside, the sun is shining brightly and, from the half-open window, he is reached, along with delightful buffets of fresh air, by the echo of plentiful joyous noises. Our lad is vividly tempted to put his vexing book aside, and go out to meet some friends. However, this movement engendered by automatism, this “impulse”, encounters opposition on the part of the youth’s “conscience”: The date of the exam, with its overloaded schedule, is approaching, and only an unbending commitment to study will enable him to absorb what can empower him to pass it. At that point, the “internal battle” from which the student’s choice of behaviour ultimately depends, is going to break out.
