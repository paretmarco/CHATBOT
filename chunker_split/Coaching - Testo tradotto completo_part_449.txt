Indeed, just as, in the field of human relationships, the frantic quest for strong and passionate emotions precludes one from establishing stable ties, in the same way the pursuit, in the arena of trading, of excitement or some other emotional goals, will tend to block the flow of money. Every one, after all, starts from sound premises. What however happens is that, as they traverse this path, they run the risk of realizing that things are not as they initially thought or imagined. It is at that point that problems begin to surface. Among the various essential points, we would like to specifically channel attention to the following: Before you inject any money into the market, a fundamental prerequisite is to properly define an objective, and then to ensure that your own conduct is going to occasion the satisfying accomplishment of what you intend to see materializing. You should formulate for yourselves a good trading method, along with the personality of a Trader who knows how to be present to whatever he does.
