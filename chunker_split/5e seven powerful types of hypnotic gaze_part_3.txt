But somebody knowing the techique exists still today. We had the chance to assist to the tremendous power of the hypnotic gaze of Virgilio Torrizzano, an otherwise quiet man living in the countryside. For example, just looking at somebody never hypnotized before, in a few seconds this subject was made completely "frozen" (about 2 seconds). After that he answered to some suggestions that were expressed even non-verbally. The response was overwhelming and then the subject could remember nothing of that. His trance was deeper as any trance achievable through verbal methods. We became friends of Virgilio and we (Dr. Tira and myself writing, Dr. Paret) were personally initiated in this school of fascination. Some of the types of gaze that you will read of here are the same practiced by him and by Prof. Erminio di Pisa, too. The latter one was a specialist in hypnotic gaze for healing. Often his patients were what are called "chronic" patients, aged more than 60. In a few seconds he was able to solve many of their problems (neuromuscular problems, tinnitus etc...). Most of the times, the results were long lasting after only three sessions of a few seconds.
