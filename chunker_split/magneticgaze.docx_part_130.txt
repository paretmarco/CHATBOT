Meanwhile, as she utters those words, she shakes the hand of the person backward and forward, until his hand is left in a raised position (Essentially, therefore, she produces a form of “catalepsy of the arm”, as it would be defined by recourse to hypnotic terms). At the same time, she says the following, ‘Think of something you want to see actualized, either for yourself or for your children …’, followed soon thereafter by the other statement, ‘ Look at me in the eye if you want it to actually occur.’ As she is busy uttering that, the gypsy woman, with the other hand, makes some gestures aimed at drawing attention to her own eyes. At that point, she proceeds by saying, ‘Concentrate’, soon after which she gets up and declares, ‘In the meantime, I am going to get up. As for you, keep on dreaming what you wish to see happening to your children.’ The subject does not stop staring into the void, now plunged into a state of full passive consciousness.
