They do not rule the world or act on the world, as Jung suggests, but are made of the same substance as The Way of the Human * Beyond Quantum Psychology the world. Archetypes come from the same condensation of the EMPTINESS formed by the Physics Dimension which'remains and is still a condensation of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. In Quantum Psychology Archetypes are patterns which describe phenomena which seem to collectively occur within the species of living beings. Archetypes are not mystical though they can be viewed that way from within the archetype themselves.

(pp. 153-154, Kaku) Superstrings can be seen as a great metaphor because, it unites, under one concept, a way to describe a unified field theory.
