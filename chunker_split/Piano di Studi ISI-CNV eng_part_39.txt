He was also initiated in various groups that continued the old tradition Mesmerismus © and Campanelli’s system: our lineage connects directly to Campanelli for the stop smoking system. Dr, Paret was the person that personally brought to the world the Campanellli’s method for stopping smoking in 55 seconds. Campanelli’s fame, punctuated by astounding results and corroborated by unimpeachable testimonies, appears to be truly unassailable. His is an unbelievable, amazing, unparalleled case, which has been studied by worldwide famous scientific celebrities, who have analyzed the phenomenon of his person and sealed their reports by stating the following: <<The relevant facts are true, and yet they are devoid of any plausible explanations in terms of ordinary therapeutic techniques>>2. Formerly an advocate practicing from his study in central Rome and an inveterate smoker, Campanelli, following a meeting with Hermann Michel, was so impressed by the fact he had succeeded in quitting smoking that he wanted to learn Michel’s magnetic and hypnotic techniques. He eventually became, in his own right, a healer specialized in removing the bad habit of smoking from fellow humans.
