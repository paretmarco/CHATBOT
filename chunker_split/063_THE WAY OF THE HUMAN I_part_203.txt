In other words, your arm is as much your mind as your head. Your feet are as much your mind as your thoughts. To take this one step further, your legs are as much spirit as your thoughts are your soul. Your stomach is as much your spirit as is the WITNESS of all experiences. Why? Because since everything is made of the same substance, then the body, mind, and spirit are not merely connected. Rather the body is the mind, the body is the spirit, the mind is the body, the mind is the spirit, the body is the witnessing presence; there are no distinctions. 124 QUANTUM BODY WORK What then is Quantum body work? The Quantum approach to the body is not one of exclusion but of inclusion. Muscles are not seen as separate from thoughts any more than waves are seen as separate from the ocean. For example, when I had some somatic work done recently, I experienced major changes in my shoulder blades after having work done on my cranium. Recently, my lower back pain disappeared after my feet received awareness and redirection. This was the true holistic vision of both Ida Rolf and Moshe Feldenkrais.
