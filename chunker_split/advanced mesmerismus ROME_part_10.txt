=============================================== END DAY 1 =============================================== INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication" Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people: Proxemics: movement of the body Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc Gaze: our gaze Magnetic passes and gestures Touch SOUND DEMO: Just using small sounds and small touches a person is put on the floor We do it to show it as the sense of balance is fundamental The mental structure is connected to physical structure ================================================ Example of something similar in the art performance. In many modern art performances the performers try to create reactions in the spectators Even in theatre. Peaple sit down and reactions are created People must be well seated in order to receive the most stimulations ================================================ HOW TO TEST IF THE PERSONNIS ENTERING IN STATE? There are two basic ways of testing 1-checking the balance of a person 2-with the use of catalepsies For checking the balance we put a hand on the shoulder of the person or we do small touches. ================================================ DEMO and exercise Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles. When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides 1 - Put a person in the center in static position 2 - Approach her from different sides Right Left Front 3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition).
