If we, for example, neglect to carry out an action and then regret our omission, we must necessarily reach the conclusion that the action had not been neglected on account of a lack of will, but due to the fact that the judgment which had been reached on its importance had been insufficiently formulated, and thus lacked the necessary time to take roots in our soul and convert into action. An embryonic idea is the first step of acting, and no break subsists between such idea and the resultant action. If we wanted to lay down a general formula, we might say that error is the by-product of a shallow judgment which is lacking in depth. The achiever, by contrast, deeply elaborates the idea which he subjects to examination. We will in essence find that what is needed is to nurture intuition along with one’s analytical faculty. Exercise 39 – Light and ideas Think of something you desire, and make it as broad as you can, e.g. experiencing a life of happy relationships. Repeat to yourselves the phrase, ‘I wonder in how many different ways I can experience happy relationships in life’, as you keep watching a light for some thirty seconds.
