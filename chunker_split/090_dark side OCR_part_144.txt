Part of the film is shot from the viewpoint of a young girl who is supposed to be a "paranoid 88 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child schizophrenic." In one scene, her older sister is making sandwiches for them. The kitchen looks about 10 feet by 10 feet. When you see the room through the paranoid schizophrenic woman' s eyes, it looks about 6 feet high by 4 feet, almost like a box. Next, there is a fly in the room as seen through the older sister's eyes. When the younger sister comes in, through her eyes, the room is crawling with insects. The question, of course, is "Who is illusioning?" By societal agreement the younger sister is. In reality, they both may be illusioning. Case 3: A woman who had been sexually molested was illusioning snakes. She saw snakes pouring out of her mouth, her ears, and her vagina. Her inner child was illusioning in present time, the penis intrusions of past time. In other words, she shifted the penis intrusion to snakes to avoid the even greater pain of incest.
