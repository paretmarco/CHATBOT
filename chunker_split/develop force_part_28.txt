There is no exercise able to force the air to get in each particle of the lungs, as the one described above. It will take you no more than one minute each morning to perform this exercise, and a few days will be enough to convince the student that the benefits obtained are great. Not only is of great benefit to health, but also infuses to both, body and spirit, a magnetic energy not obtainable in other way. The key of muscle tension Let us act now on the muscles. These are the fundamental keys to increase progressively the magnetism. The mind works on the muscular system, but the latter can act upon the mind too. Characteristic of the work done with muscles is the nervous effort. Nervous effort activates a series of reactions in mind as well as physical exertion increases muscle mass. This energy is released later, and can also be increased to higher levels with subsequent contractions. The kinds of tensions to create energy have a particularity: we tense simultaneously a muscle and his antagonist. Therefore, we do not have movement, but simple contraction. Some scholars have supposed that this type of muscle tension, to a psychological level corresponds to a "not done action". Whenever we do an exercise of this kind, we load a unit of energy. You can increase the tension up to vibrate. In addition, the vibration creates a pace that can ease, by resonance, the creation of brain coherence.
