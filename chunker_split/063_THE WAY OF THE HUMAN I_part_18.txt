In this way, we can allow each dimension of humanness to have its function, without trying to change, override, overcome, or trade in one in favor of the other. To illustrate, it is the function of my right hand to write. It is the function of my mouth to take in food. Obviously my hand and my mouth are connected as they are part of my body but they have different functions. In the same way, we often try to "reform" our animal nature (lust) or emotional dimension (anger) by being celibate (if one's a yogi) or unconditionally loving (if one's a New-Ager). We can see that this rarely works. Why not? Because being unconditionally loving is not a function of our animal or emotional nature; rather it is a function of our ESSENCE (to be discussed in greater detail in Volume III). COLLAPSING AND. CONFUSING THE LEVELS In Quantum Consciousness we call this confusion "collapsing the levels." Problems arise, for example, when we try to change and make our thinking level, emotional level or animal nature, unconditionally loving (which is a function of ESSENCE).
