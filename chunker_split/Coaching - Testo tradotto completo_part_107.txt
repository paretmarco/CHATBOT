Putting it even better, every series of thoughts must gather around a dominant question, the solution to which is adopted as one’s purpose. The man who is prey to his thoughts occasionally has some ideas, which lack however orientation to the right direction. Mental balance and the relinquishment of worries represent the dual precondition for the productive exteriorization of geniality and intuition. The very first effort must accordingly aim at achieving emotional self-control, i.e. at reacting calmly to the small irritations of everyday life. The first thing to do when you wake up in the morning is to say to yourselves: “Regardless of whatever might happen, I want to stay calm, in charge of myself, and in a state of balance. I am appointing my person as my own guard, and finding my centre in my own self”. As you persevere and develop self-consciousness and self-presencing, you will eventually come to develop a harmonious state. Having achieved that, your mind might then be led to create through the medium of specific methodologies, and every new creation of your mind will empower you to progress.
