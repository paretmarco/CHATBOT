The Dark Side of the Inner Child Structural and Strategic Family Therapy In these two widely used forms of family therapy, the child often is brought to therapy with a problem, e.g., disobeying Dad/ Mom, being disrespectful, drugs, teen pregnancy. In these models of therapy, the child might fuse with Mom who is angry with Dad, and the child becomes Mom' s angry voice. The treatment is to separate the child from being the mother' s spokesperson (de-fuse), and have the mother speak for herself to the father. In this case, the child believes she is helping or protecting Mom. Actually, the child is fusing with the parent, which diverts the parents' attention from handling their own relationship problems. The depth of this trance, taking on someone else's identity to survive, can be seen in relationships. For example, many clients tell me that they sound like their mother when they yell at their kids or husband. Or, a husband will become just like his father in business. I had a client recently who claimed, "I am a workaholic."
