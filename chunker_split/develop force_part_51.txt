When we operate at the same time on two hands then we arrive at a new and higher sense of unity. Exercise 28: Hot water and cold water. 1) Put a basin with cold water to the right 2) Put a basin with hot water to the left 3) Put a hand in the basin of cold water and a hand in warm water basin and at the same time try to reverse the perceptions. Some will totally. Others will only partly. Anyway, make the maximum effort and act without using the imagination (so you do not have e.g. to imagine ice) but the willpower only. Note, it could seem it was you heating the water. Then you will see that you actually have achieved control over your perceptions. Exercise 29: With breathing Perform the same exercise again, but holding breath The exercise has a strong symbolic value. The first symbol of the exercise: the non conditioning With this exercise our being is no more influenced from temperatures of "waters" (symbolized by an arrow that goes down ? ). The second symbol of the exercise: the upper dimension With this exercise, you log on to an aerial dimension that is no longer tied to "land" (symbol ? ). The tradition symbolized this dimension by an early development of mercury (symbol r). Namely we are at a point where the polarities meet and can be controlled.
