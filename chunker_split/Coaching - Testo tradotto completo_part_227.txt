“Act in the same way as the archer — an Eastern poet says — who, with his eye, aims much farther than the target he knows he can actually reach, since that will ensure that the arrow, pushed by the force of his desire, is going to fly as far as it can”. Even assuming you are unable to survey your entire life, you should let yourselves project your ideal as far as is possible, and, in addition, you should bring yourselves in touch with your own individuality. The ideal of the artist cannot be the same as that of the farmer, just as the ideal of a maid cannot be identical to a soldier’s 55. Every ideal or “life plan” must be founded, first and foremost, on a full knowledge of one’s own nature and potentialities. It is, in essence, an exteriorization of something which is experienced inside one’s being. Whatever can be demanded from man is that he,— after a detached self-critique —, should take care of trimming down his defects and simultaneously highlighting his peculiar natural gifts.
