The tragedy, of course, is that others are used to aggrandize the false self. . . . The internal experience of this need for mirroring reduces to a more or less constant need for others to notice, confirm, and bolster the insecure self presented to the world. Narcissists with this level of development often have some insight into their narcissistic character, even though they may not know this pejorative and unfortunate label. (pp. 51-52) I have seen this form of narcissism quite frequently with people who organize their entire external world to support their false self. Here we also see the guru trance and the False Core of "Worthless" seeking flattery (see Volume II). For now, it can be said that gurus often allow their personality to be worshiped more than their real SELF (THAT ONE SUBSTANCE). They do this by allowing disciples to "take on" the guru's personality, rather than frustrating the disciples' infantile attempts to realize the truth through mimicry, fusion or modeling. This is like a child mirroring the parents' behavior.
