There is a close link between “trance” and hypnotic phenomena. Let us provide an example to clarify the understanding of the concept. Let us take the phenomenology relating to amnesia. In the course of a hypnotic show, one can get a demonstration when a participating subject might be asked, say, about his name or a particular number. Thereafter, that person, on being posed the question “what is your name?”, might not know what to say in reply. The circumstance is seemingly amazing, but in actual reality it is no more than the simple elucidation of a natural human mechanism. This type of spectacular phenomenon is essentially possible because it also occurs daily in a very subtle manner: We meet for instance an obese lady, with a habit of eating a lot, who utters the promise that, from the following day, she is no longer going to eat chocolate sweets. This obese female appears to be persuasive when she articulates that promise. Nevertheless, two seconds later she walks in front of a confectionery, moves in, takes two such sweets, and eats them. How is that possible?
