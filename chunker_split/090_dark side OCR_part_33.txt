The Beginning of the End of Inner Child + 17 Conclusion This book will help individuals and therapists take the next step and (1) de-construct the inner child through understanding its strategies, and (2) return an individual to the source of his/her experience rather than referencing old experiences that no longer serve a useful purpose. â€¢3 Philosophy and Origins of Trance This work represents an integration of Western Psychotherapy, Eastern Philosophy and Quantum Physics that has grown from my experience as a therapist. I have found that Western ideas such as those of Milton H. Erickson, M.D., the father of modern hypnosis, complement Eastern concepts of the observer and the understand- ings that developed in quantum physics, specifically by Werner Heisenberg. Throughout this book I refer to all states of consciousness (other than the uninterrupted awareness of the observer) as a trance state. The following chapters will demonstrate that the created, time-frozen I-dentity of the inner child has certain games, strategies and thought processes. The child inside each one of us has been frozen through trauma and chaos. This can be likened to a photog- rapher with a video camera holding his/her finger on the pause button.
