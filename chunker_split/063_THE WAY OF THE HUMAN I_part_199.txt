In the same way, if body work is done without psychological therapy, although the body will be clear, the mind will continue to associate past emotions with certain bodily positions or sensations which occurred when the incest occurred (i.e., numbness in the genitals, holding of the breath, etc.). This is not to say psychological work will not help or impact the body, or that body work will not help or impact the psychology. Rather, they will impact each other, but the work cannot be completed unless it is Jnet at the level of the problem.

QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The problem must be met at the level of the problem. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: No one system can do it all.
