QUANTUM MAGIC REALITY AS DESCRIBED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS In quantum mechanics, reality is described by waves defining the probabilities of different outcomes from the same interactions. These waves manifest as what we have been taught to call matter, energy, particles, and/or waves when observed. In other words, there is never a fixed reality, but always the probability that a certain reality (outcome) will manifest itself to an observer when an act of observation will be done. We are in the “world of possibles”. Also, the act of observation itself is not neutral, as many physical experiments (for exemple the double slit experiment) show clearly that following the way in which we observe reality this can manifest itself or as particle or as wave. In other words the observer influence the observed. In fact it is our observation that creates the “part”. Reality is an unbroken whole. As we extract from the universe a “part” we are defining something in a way. Bohm spoke of explicate order and implicate order. The explicate order is what we observe, but universe would be an unbroken whole. These probability waves overlap and continue forever.
