We can discern the fact that this variety of exercises adds to the usual exercises centred on presence, which have been set out earlier in this book, such a level which prevents one from thinking he can practice “presencing” while in actual fact he is sleeping. Whoever is less present is less dense as well, and his attention “jumps”, without being constantly there. During business negotiations, for instance, a person lacking the ability to exercise mental control will lose himself in his thoughts a thousand times. It follows that, during communication, there are voids inside which one steps. These “voids” are not just “psychological”. There is also a higher dimension to such phenomenon. How many times, for instance, we omit doing something only because a voice inside us tells us not to carry it out? In an identical fashion, it might happen to us that we act simply because we follow an inner voice urging us in that respect. It might be legitimate for us to think that, perhaps, all of us are related to one another and are able to hear some messages in these voids.
