In The Way of the Human, the body is not to be excluded but included; emotions are not to be judged as bad, but as a vehicle to deepen our realization of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Many an ancient scripture contends everything is ONE, or as Quantum Psychology states, everything is made of THAT ONE SAME SUBSTANCE. This means also that the body, with its thoughts and feelings, is the same substance as everything else and is THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Spiritual philosophies (as we will explore later) are oftentimes spiritual trances which prevent us from experiencing the present moment; and more often than not, reinforce our internal psychological structures and developmental arrests, blocks, gaps and conflicts. This Volume is dedicated to humanity, with the understanding that our animal- and psycho-emotional nature must be included and seen as important as our essential nature so that ultimately the underlying unity of our Quantum nature can become stabilized and remain in our awareness. So the purpose of this Volume is 1) to present and complete the dimensions of awareness; 2) to have them written down, defined and clarified; and 3) to have closure, a completion for "me."
