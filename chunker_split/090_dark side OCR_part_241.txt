Therein is freedom. An incest survivor from a dysfunctional family experiences chaos. He is driven to create a good Dad inside, who is always there, calm and peaceful. This gives the child' s life meaning and stability, but it robs the individual of understanding. By creating structures (lies) to handle chaos, we lose ourselves: the one who is observing and creating these structures. To give another example of the self- to-self lie, recently I was giving a workshop in the Midwest. The man sponsoring me was complaining about a woman with whom he was involved. He said, "I can't believe I chose the same type of woman again." I said, "That's because you lied to yourself from the beginning." After a moment or two of shock he said, "You know, you're right. I knew from the beginning what was happening, and lied to myself." This freed him immensely, because he could now take responsibility for his actions rather than feeling victimized by her actions.
