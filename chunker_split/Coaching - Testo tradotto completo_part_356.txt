After some thirty seconds, close your eyes, lay the palms of your hands over the eyes, and keep your eyes shut all the way until the image of the residual luminous trace has fully disappeared. During the period when the residual image is going to subsist, do not think about any thing at all. Limit yourselves to exclusively watching the transformation of the luminous forms. After a while you can open your eyes, as the exercise would have drawn to a close. Alternative method We can of course implement the exercise even during normal sleep. If you happen to be lying on your bed, rest the tip of the middle finger of your right hand on your forehead, precisely by the hollow dip which lies slightly above the base of the nose, in the space between your eyelashes. Having done that, exert an energetic and uninterrupted pressure on your skull, without going to any extreme length. You must fall asleep in that very position.
