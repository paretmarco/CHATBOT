Acting in the same way as the rest is a norm which is founded on fear (Tao Te King) Nurturing one’s own originality is every person’s first imperative. This originality, however, cannot be attained save by fighting against the societal microcosm and macrocosm which are inclined to absorb us. By that, we are preaching neither some kind of anarchy nor any incentive to rebellion. Our intention is rather to stress that passive man, the man in the grip of habits, is a useless being, a mere number whose disappearance matter nothing. No man exists who, in some respect, is not to an extent original. Discovering one’s own originality, cultivating it, increasing it, is the sole duty that each one of us has vis-à-vis the world. If accomplishing that necessitates one to rebel against the environment, daring is a must. Yes, the narrow society, one’s entourage, might despise us, but the future is going to prove us right. We should often remind ourselves of our smallness. We should bear that in mind in the midst of our pleasures and grieves, our business deals and games, as well as amid love and death.
