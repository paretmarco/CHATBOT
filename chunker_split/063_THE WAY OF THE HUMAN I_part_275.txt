For example, "If I can control this (animal), God (morn/ dad) will reward me (maybe with enlightenment, or a new bike)." If I control emotions and create new beliefs I can get what I want from the external. In short, be able to merge (i.e., with the unity, Morn/ Dad). If I can control this animal, then I will get love and acceptance which means I will be able to merge (be one and not separate from Mom/Dad etc.). This is an underlying belief from infancy. "If I can control my biological urges, I can control another," or "If I can control my biological urges," I can control what the external world gives me (Mom/Dad later spiritualized as God or guru giving enlightenment for being good) and how the world responds to me. But notice how much pain you go through because you can't control the situation or another by controlling yourself (the animal). This is the collapsing of the levels.
