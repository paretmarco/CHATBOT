We have to do that in order to manage activity as wisely as possible, and the wisest way, indeed, coincides with the bravest one. True, whoever walks might even stumble, and yet he moves forward; as for the one who is stuck to his seat, he will always find himself in exactly the same place, without ever advancing, and will become fed up with his immutable place, whether it is a heap of litter or a comfortable couch. Even professional activity can — and in fact should — be considered as if it represented one single and progressively evolving task leading to an ultimate goal, which should be as lofty as possible, ennobled by one’s ideal, and kept alive by the concrete interest one has in attaining it. Daily life, in that event, would no longer be the same throughout, and will rather signal a progress compared to the work of the day before and a prefatory step towards the one of the following day. The conscious awareness of creating something useful or pleasant must always be infixed in our mind, as it would thereby make work cheerful and light.
