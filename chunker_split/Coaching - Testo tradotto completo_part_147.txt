Do not turn your profession, your social position, your religious or political faith, into the centre of your being. One has to be first a man, and only then an officer or a sectarian adept. You should never speak ill of any person: This is indeed a “selfish” rule one ought to take into account. Do not express your opinion unless you have been solicited to do so. As for whatever you have no interest in, it is incumbent on you to leave the unwelcome role of the propagandist to somebody else. It is necessary, at this juncture, for you to clearly understand what is being put forward herein. The philosophical reflections on the uselessness of anger and emotion must be firmly etched in our mind, in order for us to acquire a calm temperament. When, however, emotion supervenes, it is hardly possible to subjugate it by addressing it through nicely reasoned arguments. That which, however, differentiates the man who works on his own self from the average human being, is the length to which emotion is held back, and the manner in which it is managed. Emotion is a species of folly, or else a temporary intoxication of our nerves.
