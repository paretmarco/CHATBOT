Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together. EQUALIZATION . How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.)
