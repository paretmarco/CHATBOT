Wolinsky:The Electro-magnetic mechanism, how have you tried to deceive it? ________________ Louise:I pretend it is not there. Therapeutic Note We are separating in the languaging her from the Coil-implant that we are calling an Electro-Magnetic Mechanism. Wolinsky:How has the Electro-magnetic mechants de- ceived you? Therapeutic Note Here, I am trying to give "her" a greater ability to explore the Electromagnetic mechanism as a way to look at its impact and then dismantle it. Louise:Pretending it is useful. Wolinsky:How has the Electra-magnetic mechanism de- ceived itself? Louise:This is like science fiction. It is as if I am just a host for this Electro-magnetic mechanism. Wolinsky:How you doing now? Shaky. Where is the Electro-magnetic mechanism now? Is it still in your body? In the field around my body and in the nervous system. Does this Electro-magnetic mechanism have any movement? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Therapeutic Note Quantum Psychology discovered that the Electro-magnetic mechanism seems to pulsate, so I just want to bring her awareness further into "haw" it works. It pulses, very fast. Where is it in your body now? Here (stomach).
