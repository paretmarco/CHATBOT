Yet what was a survival strategy for an overwhelmed child attempting to cope with chaos becomes the core of symptom structure for the coping adult. Not to be confused with the so-called precious inner child now so popular in therapeutic circles, this is a wounded inner child stuck at a particular point in time. The words inner child have drawn much fire from different schools of psychotherapy. Actually, to clarify, the inner child concept is not new. In the Psychosynthesis of Roberto Assagioli, he talks of subpersonalities. In the Gestalt Therapy of Fritz Perls, he developed the experience of having different parts dialoguing with one another, the work of Eric Berne, M.D., called Transactional Analysis, developed not only the inner child, but the inner adult, and the inner parent. In discussing the cognitive therapy of Dr. Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, M.D. talks of a similar concept called Schemas. A second major concept in the cognitive model consists of the concept of Schemas. The concept is used to explain why a depressed patient maintains his pain-inducing and self- defeating attitudes despite objective evidence of positive factors in his life. Any situation is composed of a plethora of stimuli.
