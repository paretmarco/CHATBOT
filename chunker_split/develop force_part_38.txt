Experimentally we observe that, constantly operating and maintaining awareness of the body, first it take place a rebalancing and realignment due to the abandonment of unnecessary tensions; and is a feeling of energy too. After a little, we pass to a further stadium. Continuing in the work of the body consciousness we will even leave useless identifications (which are "mental activities", mental projections of the body) coming to a perception of it as "not expressible verbally." The body is something real and is no longer an "Id". The rule of "three times ten minutes" Since one "falls asleep" too easily, decide to be present for yourself three times for ten minutes every day. You have to hear, see, and be into reality at the highest level. Other exercises All the exercises that follow now will have a short duration at the beginning; the unexercised could not hope for a too long presence in themselves. We must here clarify what we intend for exercise perfectly performed. An exercise is perfectly executed until in the brain there is no break in the continuity of attention. It is therefore obvious that we cannot perform well the exercise and worry if the exercise is well executed at the same time. The same moment mind asks this question, the exercise is finished. Therefore, the question â€œDo I have performed well this year?" will always be related to an exercise already accomplished, could not be more than merely retrospective.
