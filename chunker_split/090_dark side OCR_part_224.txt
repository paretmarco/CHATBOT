This concept comes from the child who believes, and arguably so, that he is entitled to be taken care of just because of who he is. This is a normal phase of development that, when interrupted, keeps the person stuck at this child-like level of "the world owes me a living." Spiritualizing pain Another third level process is spiritualizing pain. In the spiritu- alization trance, lessons to be learned seem to be the common explanation for pain. While living in a monastery in India, often we would get letters from the West saying something like, "I'm really learning a lot," "I'm really growing a lot," or "I've learned a lot of lessons about life," and we would laugh and say to each other, "Boy, they must really be in pain." This form of spiritual re, rame has become popular lately. Some might argue it has value in presenting people with a different perspective on their situation. This may be true, but the issue of pain, chaos, and the case of spiritual reframing to organize it, comes into question.
