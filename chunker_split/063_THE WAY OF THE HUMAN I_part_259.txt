Psychology oftentimes splits the person off, taking them out of the animal context of their biology and creating a false context "as if psychology were not a part of biology, thus causing their thinking process to become dissociated from their biology. In this way social rules (external) become the context rather than the animal and biological nature which we are all organized around, i.e., I have to hold in my shit until a certain time, and eyen if I'm hungry I can only eat at dinnertime. Psychology tries to gain control over the animal but it can't be done, and this makes us feel even more chaotic and split-off from "ourselves" and "others." This is why Nisargadatta Maharaj did not say "mind and body" or "mind body," but rather "body-mind." BIOLOGICAL SPIRITUALITY Through biological deprivation, trauma and the dissociation or splitting off that occurs from the pain story of that narcissistic injury (see Volume II), you get psychology. When psychology is aberrated and dissociated, you get a high percentage of what people call "spirituality." Biological spirituality is experiencing the body as grounded and being made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.
