THE FALSE CORE (VOLUME II) "Whatever you do, you do for your own sake: The Upanasads Chapter 11 QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Whatever the False Core-False Self does, it does for its own sake; i.e., its own survival. What is the False Core Driver? The False Core Driver is that one concept or conclusion you hold about yourself which organizes your entire psychologyâ€”every thought, association, memory, fantasy, action, reaction, etc. It holds together your entire internal world (how you perceive yourself) and how you imagine and project how others perceive you. The False Self Compensator is the way you try to overcome this primary concept. According.to Freud, "All traumas come in chains of earlier similar events." In other words, "the mind" has an associational and generalizing tendency. In short to insure its survival, it searches and scans the environment for "danger." Unfortunately, it uses the past as its reference point. In this way, the scanning-searching device, which is part of the organism's survival mechanisms, "sees" "danger" where there is none.
