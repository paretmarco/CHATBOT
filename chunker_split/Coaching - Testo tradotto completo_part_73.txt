Which new thing have I discovered? Key elements to which attention should be drawn The unity and clarity of the purpose Compliance with the aforesaid first rule, which enjoins the elimination of the mentally superfluous, presupposes such a prompt perceptiveness as to enable us to realize at once that we are engaging in something that is uselessly dispersive, thereby leading us to take remedial steps at once. This task will only be made easier if the following peremptory norm is borne in mind: You must always organize activity for the sake of a demarcated aim. Put differently: You ought to know which practical and immediate aim might be secured by your activities, whereupon you will have to canalize your activity towards such aim. What we mean by “aim” is a result which ought to reasonably consist in self-improvement, in an increment of power. Whenever you act, you should be aware of what you want. It is only then that you can move from being merely active to be effective.
