I want you to contemplate that the senses move not by your will, but it is the VOID. Everything appears to move by the VOID. Contemplate that for a moment. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to say, "Allow the VOID to live through you." Contemplate: That you are not living a life, but that you are being lived. The VOID lives through you. A student commented about this meditation: "What it did more than anything was make me realize that the that thinks it's doing all of this is my own creation, it's an illusion. It's always the divine or VOID that's moving everything, and to superimpose on that the belief that 'I'm doing it' is ego and illusion." I told him that one of the first principles of Yoga is, "I am not the doer." I added that, "The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (also called the SELF in India) does everything." He replied, "It makes the 'I' a real illusion." Not doing anything, that's a real letting go because the "I" wants to control.
