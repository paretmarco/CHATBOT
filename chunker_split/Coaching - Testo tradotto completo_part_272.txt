Every evening, without fail, our daily activity should be examined on the basis, not on the judgment of the outside world, but rather on the judgment which is dictated by our own consciousness. Such consciousness must be essentially non-emotional, and rather directed at the discovery of new solutions and spaces for all those instances in which we have lost self-consciousness and we have “forgotten” what we truly wanted to achieve. Exercise 50 – A most useful exercise consists in what is called “reverse visualization”. In essence, we look at our day backwards, moving from the last event of that day back to the first one. By moving backwards, we will realize the extent to which we were actually free even though we were failing to realize that truth. The exercise might be conducted over longer periods, such as a full week. NB: The repeated implementation of this exercise also produces an improvement in our memory.
