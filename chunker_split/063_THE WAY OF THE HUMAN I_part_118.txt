Her husband was angry, abusive and trying to "steal" their shared valuables. She said to me, "I am trying to stay in ESSENCE," but I suggested a basic Quantum Psychology Principle: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. In this case, yes, stay in ESSENCE and on an external level, hire a lawyer. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. 65 QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: What is true at one level of awareness is not necessarily true at another level of awareness. To illustrate, because I believe (thinking dimension) I am a great singer or surgeon does not mean I can sing at Lincoln Center or perform surgery at John Hopkins (External Level). The belief that I am a surgeon is a true belief at the thinking dimension, but it is not true in the external dimension. If I experience flying in a dream (Collective Dimension), it does not mean my body can fly. If I am at the level of VOID, it does not mean that there will no longer be feelings at the emotional level. As will be demonstrated, confusing levels can cause misunderstanding and pain.
