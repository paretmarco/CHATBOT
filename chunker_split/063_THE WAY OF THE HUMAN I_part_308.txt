When they focus on the Porsche or anything else they want, some people will do everything possible in the universe to make that desire come true. It could be a relationship, it could be new clothes, it could be a job, it could be any one of a thousand things. But instead of focusing on the Porsche, I would like you to pull your attention away from the desired object and turn it toward the desire itself as energy. Most people have desires—it doesn't matter what they are—and they spend most of their lives reacting to that desire, trying to fulfill it externally. If you're always thinking about having a relationship, you're always out there looking for someone. But if you 195 The Way of the Human a Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness focus your attention on the energy itself, my experience has been that you can either have the relationship or not, but that either way is okay. This is what I mean by focusing on the energy of the desire, rather that on the desired object. Turn your attention inward and focus on the desire as energy.
