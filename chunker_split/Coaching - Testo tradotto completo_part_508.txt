Let us for instance use, as an illustrating example, the swing trading method, which is also defined as the double minimum or doubled maximum method. If the market is bearish, and my swings are negative throughout the “time frames”, I might end up “short” (= enter a downward position) with every pullback. What happens, however, if not all the swings are turned downward? In that instance, I would necessarily have to decide what represents the most important move for that moment, in order for me to then march onto the stage of making operational choices which are consequential thereon. Quantum Coaching for developing financial intuition Intuition is a superior mechanism. It represents our capacity of interpreting a reality which in itself is something chaotic. We are obliged to grasp the essence of the process of intuition. Intuition is utterly different from an automatic mechanism. The automatic mode is the way machines, too, function, as with the classical trading systems based on a software program. In actual fact, however, the world is governed by chance.
