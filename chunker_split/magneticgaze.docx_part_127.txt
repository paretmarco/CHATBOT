Such practice helps the operator create a bit of confusion, but at the same time it assists one in hypnotizing. In fact Virgilio, who is particularly adept at mental imagination, conjures up in his mind the idea that there is a true spiral rotating in front of him. Exercise 40 Point your finger towards the front of the person you want to hypnotize. Turn that finger clockwise, in so doing imagining that a spiral is rotating as you turn the finger. Thereafter, you should stare at the centre, between the eyes of your subject. As you engage in that, you ought to give one intense look. You will moreover feel that a change has occurred in your subject’s perception. This method is further endowed with a physiological value. Special receptors located in the visual cortex (at the back of the brain), which are called “detectors”, are thus stimulated up to a straining degree.
