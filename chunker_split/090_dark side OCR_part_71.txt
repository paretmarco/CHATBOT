His inner child hypnotized my client, who was a family therapist, into treating the man as his mother and the woman as his father. He realized, as he observed the inner child, that in many of his relationships, his age-regressed inner child trance-fered the past Mom and Dad on present-time people. This is more common than therapists realize. For many years I was trained as a family therapist. As I watched other family therapists work, I would watch them, (through the one-way miror) age-regress and feel powerless to help a couple or family. This is the power of age- regression. Even trained family therapists have a dark side of an Futurizing 43 inner child in them. If, while giving therapy, the family who is receiving therapy activates the therapist's inner child, the therapist age-regresses and feels powerless to help the family. This is exactly how the therapist felt as a child powerless to help their family. This is why the family trance is so powerful, and often times why some family therapists work with a co-therapist in the room. Hopefully, one of them will stay in present time and not age-regress.
