It is the opinion of this author that Erickson, as would anyone who suffered from polio and strokes, went through deep powerlessness, confusion, and chaos, which were time frozen. He then utilized that state and did unto others that which was done unto him; created confusion in others. He used this, however, to help people by-pass conscious interference and helped them feel powerful when they complained of feeling powerless in their lives. Erickson could also feel powerful inducing confusion in others, which was done unto him. This would enable Erickson to counter his own feelings of powerlessness by keeping others "one down," and himself "one up." This was the creative genius of Erickson, utilizing his own Con-fusion + 99 process of confusion to help empower others and himself. When creation of confusion to handle powerlessness is placed on automatic, however, the individual begins to experience feelings of isolation, alienation, being misunderstood and loneliness, be- cause to maintain the feeling of power and control, a person must continue to create confusion in others and in his own world. Often the overly-intellectual person will use the above strategy.
