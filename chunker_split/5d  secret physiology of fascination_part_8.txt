The same can happen when flying an aircraft and performing a task such as interpreting radar contact information on a HUD. Focal vision is used to consciously decipher task-oriented information while peripheral information is subconsciously used to maintain spatial orientation." GOING BEYOND THREE DIMENSIONAL REALITY Altering binocular function Binocular functions refer to the ability of the eyes to coordinate their activity so that we can merge the visual fields of both eyes into one distinct image. The most commonly observed aspects of binocular functions include convergence (the ability of the two eyes to team and focus on the same object), and accommodations (the ability of the eyes to shift their focus from near point to far point or vice versa). Each eye can have normal acuity (20/20 vision) but unless the eyes team, visual functions are impaired; <in observing very fast one eye after the other it seems that we alter binocular functions. AWAKENING LEFT SIDE OF VISION - WORKING ON THE LEFT EYE HANDS AS VISUAL CUE TO INCREASE ATTENTION USING PERIPHERAL MOVEMENTS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF BODY POSITION Moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can result in affecting the sense of balance.
