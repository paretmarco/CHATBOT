Throughout the book, I break down the word identity to I- dentity, to emphasize how the adult in present time becomes an /-dentity in past time. Calling the memory "I" creates a separate I- dentity (This will be discussed further in Chapter 6). In this case, however, the child gives up himself and represses his inner wants or desires. In fact in many cases of co-dependency, the pleasing aspect of the child is covered by a layer of rage. In this example, the inner-child pleaser created by the observer also has its opposite, an angry dark side which the pleaser is masking. After all, wouldn't you get angry if you had to please to get love? Often times clients I work with have a continual low-grade anger or irritation, which they blame on the world. When a client presents me with, "I am continually angry at the world," I ask her, " What need do you have that is unmet?" Frustration and anger is caused by not getting what you need or want. Often times we get angry and blame the outer world rather than asking ourselves, "What do I want that I am not getting?"
