Let's look at an infant just around the time of birth and through the first several years of development. First Level Processes First level processes involve basic cognitions or understand- ings that an infant internally develops and later generalizes to the world. Cognitive trance structures produce understandings for the infant in the development of the inner child identity. This trance understanding carries over to how the child views himself, his parents, God and the workings of the universe. This developmental process from infant to child is noted here so we can question basic assumptions we have about life and see them as just assumptions. Questioning our world view, or shall I say the world view of the infant/child identity which is the window we habitually look through, enables us to dispel age-regressed limita- tions and move closer to the pure awareness of the observer uninhibited by personal trances. For example, when a child believes she always should be taken care of, frustration ensues when the child within an adult hypnotizes the adult into believing she is entitled to be taken care of. The assumption, "I'm supposed to be taken care of," diminishes per- 126 4:0 The Dark Side of the Inner Child sonal responsibility and power.
