At first he saw, heard and felt only me; now he feels, thinks, desires and acts only in conformity to my caprice. I can force upon him the falsest ideas, the most illusory sensations, the most unnatural desires, the strangest acts. He accepts them and obeys without resistance. He has abdicated his will without regret, under the charm of a seductive fascination. This is the unconscious phase; it presents none of the characteristics of either physiological or pathological sleep. I will speak further on of suggestion in its expiration. When the subjects are quite docile the most marvelous results are obtained at once. Thus in presence of the photographic apparatus I have attracted a number of subjects by a glance; then gesture I have rendered them as immobile as wax figures in a museum. In another photograph is represented a subject seated in an armchair. Laughing slightly, I looked at him. He commenced to laugh by imitation, and then his risibility was progressively accentuated, until he was in an ecstasy of hilarity at the moment in which he was photographed. I could as easily make him sing, cough, sneeze, make faces, etc.
