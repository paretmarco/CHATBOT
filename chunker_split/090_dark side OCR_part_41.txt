I Philosophy and Origins of Trance + 23 insisted she keep continuous eye contact with me during the process. Quite suddenly, she couldn't see me; she fogged me out. I realized that as a child, in order for her to create distance and survive, she had to not see her parents. In order for her problem (alcoholism) to continue, the dark side of the inner child had to maintain a trance, changing her relationship to the present-time world. She had to change from self-to-the-world in present time to a trance, child-to-parents in past time. Although she fogged out her parents' drinking, in order to not see it, another dissociated part of her saw it. Although part of her was hiding in the fog, another part saw the drinking. This is the power of dissociation in action. The observer/creator of the trance state holds and takes a picture of the fog and the drinking. Years later, the child within the adult had two sides: fogger/drinker. More simply put, the observer took a picture of the little girl watching her parents drinking.
