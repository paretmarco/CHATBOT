The interactions between different entities constitute a single structure of linked wave patterns, so that the entire universe can be thought of as an unbroken whole. The waves form a matrix, with all parts of the system affecting all other parts. As the implicate is a whole Non-local relationships exist between parts of the system that are distant from each other [1]. It is impossible to distinguish two particles of the same type in a region of space in which they may be found simultaneously [2]. Particles loose their individual identity in such regions. Thus, the physical universe is fundamentally unified. This important concept was expressed in various ways in different traditions. Mesmer said that in Nature emptiness doesn’t exist. The hermeticists speak of an universal spirit or light that becomes the world of forms. They make distinction between the more basic aspect of the manifestation, the reality that we observe, the world of the “forms”(the explicate order) that derives from the “absolute existence” (the implicate order). In fact, the universal truth is in wholeness.
