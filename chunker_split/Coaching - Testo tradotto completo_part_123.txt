Let go of any thought about the focal point. Now you should merely gaze at your own selves in the mirror without blinking your eyes. Look intensely at yourselves between the eyes. By carrying out this exercise, you will come to notice a number of different sensations, and at some points you will lose self-consciousness. When that occurs, try to regain presence through the means of sensory attention. Exercise 19 – Constant awareness of one part of the body Keep a continuous awareness of one part of your body (such as one hand). Over a period of time, this exercise might be accompanied by focusing one’s attention on one of your feet (if possible the one located on the opposite side). The aim of these exercises is to start “remembering ourselves”. The goal is the further development of Presence as a path to freedom. Another interesting exercise consists in being conscious of your breathing while you are eating. Exercise 20 – Awareness of one’s breathing while eating. You should now extend your concentration to your breathing while you are busy eating. You must be conscious of the fact that you are eating. Exercise 21 – Awareness of one’s speech.
