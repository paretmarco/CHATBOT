You must clearly tell your selves, persuade your selves, that tomorrow does not exist. When tomorrow will be «today», tomorrow will have already turned into something else. Our life is only made up of many different «today’s». You live today. It is today that you are called upon to act. In order to clarify the point, we are going to say that the extent of categorical commitment which we succeed in practically carrying out during a day is what confers on that day an entrenched, absolute value within the folds of a chronology, and which in any event allows you to move towards the accomplishment of your ideal. Kairòs: You must also remember, however, that, apart from being able to find a daily outlet for actualizing your talents towards a specific purpose, you should take care of successfully living every day of yours as a complete self-contained moment. Every day is in fact endowed with its own peculiar value. Being a unit distinct as such from any other unit, it must consist in a work of harmony, of unity with our own selves.
