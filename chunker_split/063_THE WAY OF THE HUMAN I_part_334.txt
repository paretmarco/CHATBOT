Developmentally, this is the earliest form of trance-ference. The adult has collapsed the levels and is age-regressed and not in present time, trance-ferring mommy onto another. These are the types of people who tend to take on other people's stuff and lose themselves. Often people stuck at this level of development (because they see Mom and themselves as omniscient) believe they are psychic, intuitive or are spiritual teachers. In relationships, these people are often great to be around because they always know what you want to do. For example, I remember a woman once had a brief relationship with. If I said, "I want Chinese food," she would say, "That's exactly what I want." If I said, "I like purple shirts with pink polka- dots," she'd say, "So do I." TWINSHIP TRANCE-FERENCE Twinship is the feeling that some people have with others that somehow we are their twin. Actually, this is trance-ference.
