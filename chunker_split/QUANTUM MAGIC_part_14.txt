Consciousness, at a fundamental level, is associated with the continuity of the underlying structures out of which matter and energy manifest. Everything shares this continuous structure; therefore everything has consciousness to some degree (though not necessarily normal waking consciousness). Quoting from Evan Harris Walker (4): "Consciousness may exist without being associated with either a living system or a data processing system. Indeed, since everything that occurs is ultimately the result of one or more quantum mechanical events, the universe is 'inhabited' by an almost unlimited number of rather discrete, conscious, usually non-thinking entities that are responsible for the detailed working of the universe. These conscious entities determine (or exist concurrently with the determination) singly the outcome of each quantum mechanical event, while the Schrodinger equation (to the extent that it is accurate) describes the physical constraint placed on their freedom of action collectively." In shamanic and in religious practice, one resonates with other intelligences to get their assistance, inviting them to join in the work at hand. These intelligences can be thought of as consciousness resonance matrices.
