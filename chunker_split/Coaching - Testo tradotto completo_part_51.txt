Moving from the aim to reality Action has to necessarily be concrete and feasibly effective. Some people believe in an ideal in the same way that many persons believe in God, without however making an effort to bring it close to themselves, to feel it inside their own selves, to ensure that such ideal is going to enlighten their lives. They might even be sincere persons, and yet their faith is frigid and useless. Accordingly, they can never decide to pause for a while so as to contemplate their ideal, make it alive and feasible, and set their firm resolution on actualizing it. It is not our intention here, however, to write down a method which is exclusively applicable to apathetic people. Every individual, however energetic and active he might happen to be, will discover some gainful advantage in this method. Every one of them will find, in the elimination of useless activities and a better arrangement of beneficial ones, both an element of conservation of time, which they might then pleasantly spend either in resting or in adding yet a new activity, and a higher quality of life.
