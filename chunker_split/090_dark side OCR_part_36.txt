The child is frozen by the observer (you) along with the trance of disconnection. (Disconnection is called "dissociation" and will be discussed more completely in Chapter 6.) When the observer fuses with the inner child, resources that could be used feel unavailable. Example: A spouse in an anger trance, throwing a tantrum at a partner, does not have the resource of remembering how much she/he loves the spouse. Rather the age- regressed inner child acts "as if" she/he were in past time with Dad. The anger trance takes the driver' s seat, and the rest of the resources of present time are not there. Any change in the trance allows the otherwise unutilized resource to become available to the observer. In other words, the Philosophy and Origins of Trance21 more you know the dark side of the inner child, the freer you become to give it up. In the above example, if the trance is allowed and both people can stay in present time by seeing the tantrum as a trance of the inner child, new choices and options can emerge in their relationship. Trances that are created by you are initially a mutual trance in the family.
