The proximity of the point being to great, the accommodation, though contracted, is insufficient, in general to allow a clear vision. As for the surroundings objects their images form only the peripheral part of the retina, since the central part is focused. The peripherical sensations on the retina are weaker than the sensations at the centre. In these conditions the subject makes himself almost blind to the external world and the more we are near, the more the process is accentuated. FIXATION OF ATTENTION and Blurring As we walk, drive a car, or fly low over the terrain, our accommodation is determined largely by Gibson's (1950) well-known "texture gradient." The retin-A unconsciously performs some kind of a product-moment averaging routine on the textural elements t o reduce the blur, and the fact that much of the scene necessarily remains blurred normally goes unnoticed so long as the acuity demand remains low. But as we point in a specific direction blurring appears in the peripheral field CIRCULATION AND EXPANSION IN THE UNIVERSE Peripheral Circular Movements Circular movements seem to have a specific exciting effect on the eyes. They can prepare the real fascination work.
