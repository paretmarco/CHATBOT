The way they had been programmed mentally was so strong that, given that the external environment did not destroy them, they elected to destroy themselves. That is the identical scenario applying to some traders who, when they are faring well in their activity, begin to embark on increasingly more risky operations, until they eventually cause their own destruction. In essence, their drama is that when success draws near their persons, they lose sight of their aim. A characteristic feature of this trance consists, moreover, in a chain of “because”, the effect of which is to make it hard to break the trance in its initial stages, insofar as the trader finds external justifications for his failures. The logical mind is in fact characterized by the tendency to work on the basis of inferences, i.e. deductively, as a result of which it is inclined to justify somehow certain beliefs which have instead been simply assimilated from one's parents or from the environment generally.
