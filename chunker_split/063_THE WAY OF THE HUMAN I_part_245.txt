In other words, there is a splitting off from your real core when you "hold' yourself up" and split off and dissociate from other dimensions of awareness. This dissociation creates "spiritual experiences," which can sometimes be "Spiritual" trances. They are dissociated from the whole (i.e., other dimensions of awareness), and hence, they are distortions created by breakages in the BIOLOGICAL CORE. It should be noted from Chapter One that Spirituality in Quantum Psychology is defined as the realization that everything is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. All experiences—be they a thought called "I hate myself' or "I love myself," anger or a vision of "God"—should be acknowledged, not interpreted, at a biological level as having been created by breakages in the BIOLOGICAL CORE and let go of. * *Please note that biological level is underscored, in Volume Ill, we see all i's and experiences as arising and subsiding with the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS.
