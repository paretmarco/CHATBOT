Man’s two times We have already stressed that every single day, in addition to being part of a global plan, must also be a full self-contained unit, while being at the same time a moment of time in which we draw nutriment from our ideal once again and discover new routes which we had previously never thought of. The goal, which is the initial foundation of the method, must always be supplemented by the concept of “opportunities”, which gradually surface in life and sometimes enable paradigm shifts to take place. The world, in truth, moves on by virtue of opportunities, but what happens is that, at times, we close ourselves to such opportunities by thinking about our objectives with excessive frequency. An objective is in fact a deformation of reality. Even though one part of external reality is structured, most of it is still governed by randomness. Over and above programmed and chronological time, in fact, there is another category of time, which is the time of the now. The ancient people already knew it. It might be the equivalent of the Greek concept of “Kairòs” (??????).
