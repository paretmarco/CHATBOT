In the same manner, when a manager suffering from gastritis experiences an irritating sensation in his stomach, he might get angry with his secretary and deal with her harshly, without even realizing that the cause of his ill-being is purely physical and cannot be solved by losing his temper with such subordinate and engaging in his consequential censurable treatment of her person. What fundamentally happens is that, around, say, the result of “being unable to succeed”, you have built a series of "because", such as “because the others know secrets I am not acquainted with”, whereby you justify the negative operations you have actually undertaken. Other illustrations would be your statement “I lack a sufficient amount of money; had I owned more, I would have bounced up again”, or “I must succeed in finding one particular formula”, etc. If you desire to exit this trance, you must take on responsibilities: Consciously or unconsciously, you remain, at all times, the one who is responsible for your own life. Stop complaining or ascribing to other people the causes of your own mistakes.
