In other words, if your biology is put into a state of deprivation, there is a shock to the body. To handle the shock, the nervous system dissociates and there is an accompanying loss of awareness of your body. This often yields a philosophy (newer brain and, after the fact, neurologically) which not only organizes the chaos of the deprivation but also moves us further away from bodily experience and hence the underlying unity. When this occurs, a substitution also occurs. For example, if my mother only touches me and is affectionate (biological merging) when I get good grades in school, then the only way to become merged with her is to achieve (see Volume II). In Quantum Psychology when you substitute an action (like good grades) as a way to receive a biological "have-to" (merging), this is called substitution. In other words, if during the socialization process a biological need is substituted, as in the above example, soon "good grades" or "achievements" equal merging. However, notice that no matter how much is achieved there is no satisfaction. Quantum PSychology separates needs from wants.
