In other words, I have a desire for eating, shitting, fucking, and sleeping and all of a sudden, the only way I get food from my parents is by having to sing a song (metaphorically speaking). So I become a professional singer in order to get fed or let's say, in order for me to get my parents' love and attention, I have to get good grades in school' so I become an over-achiever. But no matter how much I achieve, it still is not going to fill the basic desire for merger, which has a biological function. So where biological desires become a problem is when they become substituted for psychological wants. One of Buddha's Four Noble Truths is that all pain comes from desire. Quantum Psychology suggests that pain arises from substituting biological desires for psychological wants. Quantum Psychology attempts to dismantle substituted psychological wants which come out of biological desires. It's the old Zen question, What is enlightenment? When you are hungry, you eat. When you are tired, you sleep. There is no resistance or substitution.
