At the beginning, the path to the development of presence aims at being steeped, to an increasingly more more pronounced extent, in the dimensions of one's immediate sensory being. That has the effect of accentuating our level of vigilance and perception, thereby enabling us a greater extent of effectiveness. As for this higher level, we find that in it I am conscious both 1) of the fact I am speaking and 2) of what I am saying. In essence, therefore, I am being conscious at a dual level: I have in fact sensory consciousness of what I am doing (this represents the basic layer of presence, the one we have begun to develop through the exercises of the first part of this book), as well as consciousness of the meaning I confer upon things. An analogy one can draw for the sake of illustrating this concept is the one of a car: It is in fact like driving a car at a very high speed, when the driver pays attention to every thing and at the same he must, of course, know where he is heading for.
