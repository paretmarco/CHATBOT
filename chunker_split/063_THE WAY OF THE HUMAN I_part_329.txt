Survival trances come in many different forms. For example, when you are growing up, if your parents say you're wrong and they're right, then being wrong is something that is bad and generally a child 213 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is punished for it. A child may be punished by being spanked or sent to their room (which is labeled as a devastating experience, something to avoid at all costs). It's like a mini-death, which becomes fused with the idea of being wrong, and must be avoided in order to survive. This is part of the trance process. Children fixate on this mini-death of being wrong, and thus fuse together the idea that being wrong = punishment = death. Being wrong becomes a trauma. Thus, to resist the trauma, an observer and an identity are formed to defend against the experience of that mini- death. Another survival trance occurs when the child fuses with and becomes the parent, and takes on the parent's identity. For example, many people vow when they grow up they will never be like mom or dad.
