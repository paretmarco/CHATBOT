Westerners misunderstand the word "knowledge." Actually what is meant is that information (beliefs, thoughts, etc.) you have about yourself is limiting when you define yourself by it. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to say, "Anything you know about yourself is separate from you and should be discarded as not you." Practice: Let your eyes close. As information about "yourself' comes into "your" awareness, contemplate that this information is without cause. Continue to contemplate that this information is without any cause. Next, contemplate that this information does not belong to you, or an "I". Whenever you're ready, bring your awareness back to the room, notice where you're sitting, and let your eyes open. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Cause and effect are actually not separate but are one unit; hence, they could be written Cause-effect. ________________ There are no causes or effects, rather the concept of a separate cause-effect causing a separate effect to arise and subside together along with the "I" or experiencer which experiences them (See Appendixâ€”On Cause and Effect).
