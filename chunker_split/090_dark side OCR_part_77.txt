The trouble is that two people seldom agree on what fairness is, and there is no court or final arbitrator to help them. Fairness is a subjective assessment of how much of what one expected, needed, or hoped for has been provided by the temptingly self-serving, that each person gets locked into his or her own point of view. The fallacy of fairness is often expressed in conditional assumptions: If he loved me, he'd do ... If he loved me, he'd 46 4. The Dark Side of the Inner Child help me to orgasm ... If this was a real marriage, she'd hike with me and learn to like it ... If he cared at all, he'd come home right after work... If they valued my work here, they' d get me a nicer desk. It is tempting to make assumptions about how things would change if people were fair or really valued you. But other people hardly see it that way and you end up causing yourself a lot of pain."
