Therefore you can easily and we could say "mathematically" plan ahead exactly what you want to achieve, as for example somnambulism, amnesia, regression etc... Planning ahead is also necessary for other reasons. For fascinating you should enter yourself in a state of "no thinking". You too you do not have to use your rational mind in operating. The best results are achieved as you are in a particular state, called "presence", central to many esoteric schools, as for example the school of Gurdjeff, the ch'an and some spiritual alchemical paths in the western tradition. It greatly enhances the power of fascination. And finally you need to plan ahead because the subject will "feel" what is happening from your eyes and from the first moment in some deep and telepathic way. Franz Anton Mesmer, from whom the name "Mesmerism" is derived, included fascination in his practice of "animal magnetism". He said that magnetism could be transferred through the eyes to another person. He observed that this force was deeply connected to the instinctual part of man and he did in his life also a period of 3 months where he arrived to stay without any internal dialogue.
