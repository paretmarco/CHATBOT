A useful exercise is to imagine some small arrows going from your eyes to the eyes of the person you are looking at. Practice this kind of training in different sessions in the same way and with the same energy you did when you practiced looking at the point for learning how not to blink. You will soon notice also an additional capacity to focus in all situations of your life. The school of fascination has hosts of these techniques, where specific imaginations and symbols will both increase the width of your pupil and at the same time put you in a specific mental state with absolute certainty. This concludes this practical introduction to the outer techniques of fascination. Further inner and additional techniques include among others energy training, proper breathing, hands movement, other gaze patterns and practical applications. We dedicate many time in our international trainings to these elements. We encourage you to practice these exercises with a friend in order to finely tune them. What you are undergoing is developing new interpersonal skills and abilities. A proper guide is also very useful.
