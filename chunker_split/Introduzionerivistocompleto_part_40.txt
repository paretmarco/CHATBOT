“The only thing that imprisons you is your mind; the only thing that can free you is your mind!” (Sai Baba) There are two types of SELF-HYPNOSIS: western and eastern. The basic problem with SELF-HYPNOSIS is learning it correctly. Our school has created an educational technique that allows us to learn SELF-HYPNOSIS, in its two forms, in a very short time. WESTERN SELF-HYPNOSIS WESTERN SELF-HYPNOSIS MAINLY USES THE POWER OF SPEECH, AND NORMALLY DEMANDS THE USE OF THE CLASSIC HYPNOTIC TRANCE. It is important to have a well-formed objective. To be able to achieve it, you need to divide it into pieces, sensitizing it and focusing bit by bit. The objective needs to be: P positive E emotional, i.e. find motivational pleasure P present (only speak in the present, never in the past) S sensory (what you feel, see… etc. when you reach the objective) I imaginative (create a clear image of what you want to achieve) S simple M measurable A attainable R reasonable T time SELF-HYPNOSIS is a condition of the mind that allows us to control our emotions, behaviour and mental processes. It gives us the ability to focus our attention on what it is that we desire, for example, how to be concentrated, calm… etc. “Purify your thoughts and make your perception of the world clearer” (Givauden) In reality, with hypnosis, you create a conscious SELF-HYPNOSIS externally led. Now we are going to talk about creating the same condition on ourselves.
