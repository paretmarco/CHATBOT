In other words, the more we restrict the fire of attention in the course of a therapeutic trance, the more we rise to a level from which we are later capable of enlarging the perspective. It is the as if the mechanisms which guide attention, taken to some extreme level, were to “give up” and thereby enable the actualization of an expanded, vaster attention. [43] The process concerned resembles what happens at a muscular level when a tension is followed by a relaxation, which normally occurs at a higher intensity level than what would have been the case had we simply initiated a phase of relaxation without its being preceded by an earlier contraction. In terms of the praxis, this expanded state corresponds to a moment in which we move beyond the dualistic distinction between things, in which we transcend, that is, the distinction “between this and that”. This phenomenon is a common feature of various quantic therapies, and it is already implied in the process of the Gestalt. It is a similar phenomenon to the one we can ascertain during a meditation on a Japanese koan or a kindred one on some mantra.
