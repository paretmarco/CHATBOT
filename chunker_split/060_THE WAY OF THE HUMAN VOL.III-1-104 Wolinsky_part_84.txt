Now, notice the BIG EMPTINESS and how it appears to go on forever. Just keep allowing awareness itself to continue to go further and further backwards. Allow "the one" that is moving further and further backward to be the same substance as the BIG EMPTINESS. When you are ready, you can let your eyes open. From "here" we begin to appreciate that NOTHING exists except on a verbal (thinking) level. The body and the nervous system produce thoughts of I AM (fill in the blank with "I" thoughts). The body is a condensation of the Quantum EMPTINESS and is, therefore, a Quantum event. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You can only see your own level. In other words, things can only be perceived at the level that you are on. Volume III is about GOING BEYOND, about acknowledging each prior level and seeing them as a construction (condensation) of PURE UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or VOID and then allowing it to de-construct. See you soon.
