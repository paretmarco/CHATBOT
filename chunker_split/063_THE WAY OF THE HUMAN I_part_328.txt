QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The more dissociative the observer becomes, the more there is a loss of the body and, consequently, a loss of humanness and connection to humanity. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The stronger the dissociative observer, the greater the personal grandiosity. In order to survive, an observer, as well as a personality with many identities is formed, such as, "I like this," "I don't like this," "I like you," "I don't like you." These particular observers and identities contain trance states with emotions, associations and memories. Each observer-identity has many trances and ways to fixate attention. For the observer who wishes to keep and defend the individual self, these trance states must be kept alive. Inherent in all of this is the understanding that if energy is not continually put into them by the observer and these identities, then they will die or disappear. When two people argue, it is an argument of two trance-positioned observer-identities. In this way, observer identities get more and more energy put into them because people imagine and, hence, feel their survival is dependent upon them. This is a survival trance.
