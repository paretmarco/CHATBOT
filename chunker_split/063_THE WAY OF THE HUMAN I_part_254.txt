The bodily functions once repressed, however, comes out in "less appropriate," out-of-context ways (like priests molesting children). Parents often say to children, "What inside of you makes you act this way?" Quantum. Psychology says "It is the repressed animal." QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You can never overcome your animal nature. You cannot overcome your animal nature, it is not possible, and why should you even want to? As an exercise, Quantum Psychology suggests viewing life through the animal dimension. If you look at your relationships with people, you can view them through several lenses. For example, if I view people situations, people and my relationship to them, etc., through the lens of my thinking dimension, I will get one understanding. If I view this through the emotional level, I will get another. If I view my relationships through the animal dimension, however, I will get a yet another different understanding. Let's say I get into an argument in a business arrangement and feel, that they want me to sign a contract so they'll own me.
