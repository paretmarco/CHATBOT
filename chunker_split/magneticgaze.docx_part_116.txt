The mythological aim is to enable Saturn to be reborn as god of “the golden epoch”[53], that is, for your body to be enlivened by a sensation of inner light. Exercise 36 Look at some light. Close your eyes and then gaze firmly at the top area of the skull, at the same time bringing the eyes into a position of ocular convergence. Through experience, you will discover that there is a point where, aside from the residual luminous trace, you can at some stage discern the development of a sensation of inward luminosity, as well as a profound inner calm. Meditation carried out on a source of light, followed by visualizing its image while we are in a state of ocular convergence, assists the distribution of the luminous spectrum across the body, thereby energizing the different areas thereof. It further engenders harmony between body, mind and soul, since both the hemispheres are energized. In the course of our meditation on the light, we should think that light is magnetic, and that it represents a source of power. It ensues from it that working with a source of light is both energizing and tranquillizing [54]. ________________ 13.
