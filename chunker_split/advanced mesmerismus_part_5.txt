Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call "butterfly movements" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up. ============================================= Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on "warming the mercury" It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system - NORMAL - excitated this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown ============================================= For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes. We call this technique "closure of the senses" The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques: Closure of the senses Technique of the 10 plexuses CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION -. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient?
