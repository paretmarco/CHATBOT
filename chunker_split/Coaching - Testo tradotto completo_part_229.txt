Subordinating: It is to give every activity a place which is suitably proportionate to the importance it possesses within the whole. If one, for instance, were to take a vow that he would work fifteen hours a day in the hope of attaining success earlier, he would be hastening to disaster. Exhaustion and illness would not be slow to seize his being. That is because he would have neglected the aspect of his wealth at the time of defining the coordinates of the various factors he has to pay attention to. Harmonious balance with the environment As we are all separate individuals and yet, at the same time social individuals affiliated to a group, we are duty-bound, at the stage of drawing up a life plan, to take into account the environment wherein we are destined to live. We will notice even in this context that by adapting to that environment we will transform it to one extent or another. We are all modifiers and creators of environments. It is important to develop originality, the ability, that is, not to be absorbed by the environment and be left at the mercy of circumstances.
