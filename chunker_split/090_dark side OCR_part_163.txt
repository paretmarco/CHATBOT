One patient would always confuse his parents and impact his environment and relationships to gain a sense of control. People who feel they must always be one-up, subtly placing others one- down, suffer from this trance. It is the resistance to feeling powerless or one-down that the child within the adult finds abhorrent. There- fore, to not feel one-down, the strategy of creating confusion is employed. A confusion approach can work, but loneliness is a high price paid for control, particularly when the devices are so imbed- ded in the child within the adult, who no longer experiences choice.
