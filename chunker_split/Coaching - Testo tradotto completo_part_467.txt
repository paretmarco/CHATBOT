Being in need of earning, of money, of predicting the direction the market is going to take, of closing each and every deal with a gain, of perceiving ourselves to be exceptionally good every time one carries out a successful operation â€¦ All these needs might prove to be destructive! In trading, what matters is not to be in the right in every situation. Sooner or later, in fact, mistakes might be committed, and yet all of that should help teach us the purpose for which we have resolved on working in the financial markets, along with teaching us the lesson that one can learn from his errors. We can notice that, paradoxically, the road to financial wellbeing does not wind its way through having an absolute focus on money itself. A bicycle rider who restricted his whole attention solely to the act of pedalling would not be a good cyclist, and, in addition, he would soon feel tired. In order for him to win, he must also think about why he is pedalling, and where he wants to go. In the same way, money is but a means to the end of living better.
