Indeed, you can even Di.n, suppose the presence of regression in any symptom, for sucV symptom must have a time frozen quality to it that pennits repetition. Being stuck in a past "place" creates the guidelines for current interpersonal limitations. Age regression creates developmental gaps that interrupt, impede, and/or undermine adult functioning. As with all Deep Trance Phenomena, age regression wac originally created as a result of interpersonal interactions which, for whatever reasons, the child was not able to integrate. In order 'lotto integrate an experience—in essence, to resist it—the child freezei his body by tightening his muscles and holding his breath. This physiological pattern may then become the somatic basis for an automatic response an intrapersonal self-to-self trance that en- dures for decades to come. For example, Dad has a terrible habit of telling Mikie that he'll never make it—that he'll be as much a failure as his father is. Statements to that effect become part of Mikie's daily psychologi- cal menu, and he learns to deflect them by freezing his body and holding his breath. The formation of hypnotic identities and oppositional identities is discussed in detail in Chapters 10 and 19.
