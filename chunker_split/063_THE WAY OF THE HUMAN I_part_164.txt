CULTIVATING THE SECOND DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS ASPECTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS2 Differentiated Consciousness involves the making of distinctions. It is that subtle something which makes distinctions.' It is that subtle something which makes distinctions.' For example, differentiated consciousness lets us know the difference between a table and a chair, your arm and my head. On a more subtle level, it lets us know the difference between a thought and a feeling, a sound and a vision, a memory and present time.
