Notice we are separate and let the relationship be between your ESSENCE and my ESSENCE simultaneously. Notice that you have a relationship ESSENCE to ESSENCE and have simultaneously separation from me. 64 Chapter 1 Therapeutic Note This is very importantâ€”acknowledging separation at a biological, thinking and emotional level, and the total relationship at the level of ESSENCE and BEYOND. Debra:Yeah, hmrn. That answers that. I would like for you to look at your mom and to experience your ESSENCE and look at her ESSENCE so you notice the separation at a biological-thinking-emotional level, and simultaneously you notice the ESSENCE to ESSENCE relationship. It's a little harder, but yeah I could do that. Do that with your dad. It's easier to do it with mom. Notice the men out there. Notice the ESSENCE to ESSENCE relationship but there's also a separation at other levels. Yeah, this is what I was feeling with John the other night. I still love him but as a separate person on that level. Wolinsky:How are you doing now? Debra:Good, I like the way that feels. I feel very solid. Wolinsky:Good.
