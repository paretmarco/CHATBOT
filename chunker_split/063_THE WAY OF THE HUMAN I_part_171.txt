For this reason, it becomes important to notice how we interpret present time reality through the vehicle of this dimension. In this way, we can begin to discard these thoughts, which act as lenses through which we view ourself and the world. "In order to let go of something you must first know what it is." One dimension is not higher or lower than another dimension. One dimension can be clear (not pull "your" awareness) while others pull your awareness. For example, I gave a talk in Germany. Collapsing the levels kept coming up for people. There was a woman who talked about some guru in India and he kept telling her to "focus (fixate) on me, look at me, focus on me, keep your mind on me. The only way to THAT is through me." So what you have here is a fusion of the VOID and his uncooked narcissism of the thinking and emotional dimension. One Tibetan guru, died of sclerosis of the liver from alcoholism. His life and death were subsequently spiritualized as "crazy wisdom."
