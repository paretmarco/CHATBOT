ideal as outcome of a sequence of stages aiming at a purposeful goal Today’s action arises out of yesterday’s action, and is in turn the basis of tomorrow’s action. In essence, we must therefore come to conceive life as one single day where the years are represented by the hours, and the hours by the seconds: The day of eternity. Our own life, indeed, is nothing other than some part of a vaster whole. If we really want to inject meaningfulness into it, we must take this higher dimension into account. Whoever fails to pay heed to that properly will be unable to confer a clearly demarcated purpose on his own existence 48. Once this concept is well entrenched in our mind, the natural corollary which is inferred from it is that every single day will be obliged to accomplish, even to a most negligible extent, part of the overall task assigned to life as a whole, in spite of the fact that, simultaneously, any such separate day has its own validity as a self-contained lesser whole.
