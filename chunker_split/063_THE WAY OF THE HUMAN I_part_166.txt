INTUITION: A direct understanding independent of any reasoning process. An immediate cognition of an object not inferred or determined by a previous cognition. Therapeutic Note I want to give an example of intuition since it's often confused with training. Let's say someone comes to me for therapy and says, "I have a problem with relationships." If I say, "I wonder if this has something to do with your parents," this is not intuition, it's training. If I say to the client, "Did you have a dog named Fred who died when you were two?" that's intuition. To paraphrase Pir Vilayat, a Sufi teacher, intuition is when there is no way you could have known it Training is what you have been trained to know or do. MEMORY: The mental capacity or faculty of retaining and reviving impressions, or of recalling or recognizing previous experiences. This definition and those which follow in this chapter are all drawn from The American College Dictionary, (Syracuse, NY: Random House, 1963). REACTION: Action in response to some influence or event; the action caused by the resistance to another action.
