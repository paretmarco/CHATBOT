Sometimes the spouse tries to get the partner to change to fit the dream. Sometimes the dream is so idealized that the adult with a dreaming inner child suffers greatly. The work begins with my asking the adult to look at the inner child's dream rather than trying to change the spouse. The tragedy of this common situation is that the spouse never experi- ences the present-time relationship. The idealized dream is overlaid on top of what is. It must be recognized, while working with oneself, that there are feelings of grief, disillusionment, discontent, and general emo- tional confusion, when past dreams are confronted. The present world does not match the child within' s dream, which has solidified in the adult. Trance dreams are important for many reasons. Certain people do not daydream. Being unable to dream, daydream, or fantasize becomes a liability, because the ability to access one's intuition is cut off. The opposite is also true; a trance dream on automatic creates disconnections from now, since it is the child within who stops and starts the trance, rather than the observer in present time.
