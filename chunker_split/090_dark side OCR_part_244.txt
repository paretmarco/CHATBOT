* It is not my goal to destroy belief structures. It is my purpose to empower you, the creator of the belief structure. When finding out Spiritualizing â€¢ 149 who you are, all belief structures, that are like sacred cows, stand in the way ! Noted philosopher Alfred Korsybski said, "The map, is not the territory." In this way beliefs, ideas, images are not you. Rather you are the observer and creator (the territory) of the images (the map). The Next Step Handling spiritualization 1. Notice what religious or spiritual philosophy your inner child seems to be attracted to. 2. Write down the basic beliefs of that spiritual or reli- gious philosophy. 3. Notice the beliefs of the inner child and write them down. Note that the beliefs of the inner infant, (being taken care of) are often "wishes." 4. Compare the two belief structures to see if there is a parallel. 5. Notice where the inner child may live in your body (mouth, heart, pelvis, etc.). 6. Notice which spiritualization trances you're inner in- fant/child uses.
