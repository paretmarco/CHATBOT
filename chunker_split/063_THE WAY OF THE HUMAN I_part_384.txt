The developmental skill which needs to be learned during this phase is the ability to move from inward (internal) to outward (external world) and from outward to inward at choice. This can be likened to Gurdjieff's self-remembering, wherein your focus of attention is split 50-50, outward and inward. This exercise suggests you can have both by splitting your attention inside and outside so that they are equally balanced. In the words of Ouspensky (1949) who was a student of Gurdjieff: I am speaking of the division of attention which is a characteristic feature of self-remembering. I represent it to myself in the following way: When I observe something, my attention is directed toward what I observe—a line with one arrowhead: 251 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness I—the observed phenomenon. When, at the same time, I try to remind myself, my attention is directed both inward and outward, and a second arrowhead appears on the line: I---+ +— —the observed phenomenon Having visualized the process in this manner, I saw that the problem consisted of directing attention on oneself without weakening or obliterating the attention directed on something else.
