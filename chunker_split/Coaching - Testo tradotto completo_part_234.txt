We would be entitled to speak, in this regard, of the fact that no one of such frames can be squeezed beyond a certain point, lest we were to experience a reduction in our performance, due to the fact that one might not otherwise witness a proper balance between the different parts of his own self. There is, however, a frame which is both essential and of primary relevance: It is the physical frame. It is linked to the organization of one’s own physical life, and represents the indispensable foundation of everything else, the primal source of vital energy. This frame must be present at all times. The various other frames will then be spontaneously made to connect with one another, in so doing bearing well in mind the principle of “alternation”. Nay, we might even go as far as to state that satisfaction in life derives precisely from letting our unconscious assist us in setting up these frames and linking them with one another. Whichever the level at which our life is unfolding, it has to be as “multidimensional” as possible.
