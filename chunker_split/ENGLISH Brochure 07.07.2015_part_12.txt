He would then instantly ‘hypnotise’ by fixating them with his eyes and seconds later he would feel, intuitively, the problem had gone where upon he would terminate the session. Because each session only last a matter of a few minutes he was able to see up to 300 people per day without feeling drained of energy at the end of the day. How did it work? A psychiatrist, Professor Muzzana tried to explain it. He said ‘Erminio acts on the autonomous thalamus and hypothalamus within our cerebral axis, namely, the vegetative brain. He extirpates distress and restores happiness and self confidence. He removes addiction to smoking, alcohol and drugs. He has an exceptional rate of success with asthmatics, people affected by hypertension, and those beset by sexual problems or treated by dermatologists. I have attended hundreds of conferences on hypnosis: Whenever the speaker was asked to give a practical demonstration, he was almost always to bring it off successfully. This was not the case of Erminio Di Pisa. He is sure of succeeding!.... The doctor who cures six or seven patients is one who displays an abundant command of his art. Erminio goes further, by seeking to harmonize his nature with his individual subjects!’.1 (Paret, M.
