A woman I worked with, who had teen sexually abused as a child, was plagued by chronic back pain. whenever she was in a sexual situation, her back and pelvic area would respond with sensations of pain. Consequently, she did not have sex- In looking at how she created this traumatized response in present time, I saw that it began by her focusing all her attention to that arta---she was aware solely of the sensations in her back and relv15. Secondly, she dissociated from the experience; her self or"1" would go into trances of dissociation and amnesia which were the Mme trance phenomena she had developed as a child to handle the nperience of being made to have sex with her stepfather. In reversing this response pattern, I began by expanding her COMO of the sensation of her symptoms by using hypnotic sug- *RS that put her in touch with all the other regions of her body thatwere not in pain. Her body could then be experienced as an organic wholeâ€”a physical organism with unity and integrity.
