When you shake hands with someone over whom you desire to exercise an influence, you should let your handshake and look be escorted by the desire to communicate mental orders. Listening to your own selves talking: In order for your look to be effective, it must coordinate its specific action with the action which is undertaken by thought when it is conveyed through the medium of words. The following will therefore represent an essential element: "The look must never reflect a feeling which differs from the one deriving from one’s thought and expressed in the form of words. More specifically, it must never clash with such thought". It is in fact by no means an infrequent occurrence that, in the course of a conversation or a discussion, one gets assaulted by thoughts which are extraneous to the issue that is being spoken about. These thoughts unconsciously give rise to changes in one’s expression, which would then pose the risk of being devoid of the level of inner conviction which is needed so as to impress the interlocutor. An extremely valid tactic in this sense is thus provided by the following motto: Hearing and listening to our selves talking.
