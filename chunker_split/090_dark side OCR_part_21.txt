Generally, we create trances as children to handle situations that we think we cannot handle nor understand. Albert Ellis would say, "We create profound musturbatory beliefs about many instances." (Ellis, personal letter) The ones we decide we must not, should not or can not handle. These musts act as cognitive glue which hold our resistance to incoming situations or circumstances. This must not thinking tendency greatly influences our subjective experience, and Dr. Albert Ellis calls this tendency, jokingly, musturbation. For example, A child of an overbearing parent will disconnect from the situation to avoid the emotional pain. If the strategy works, the child puts the trance on "automatic." He finds himself dis- connecting and daydreaming through school, work, and eventually in relationships. A child who has a history of alcoholism and co-dependence in the family might exhibit amnesia, forget the past to avoid the pain. Later in life amnesia or forgetfulness might become a problem in work, school, or relationships. An incest survivor who went "numb" to survive the painful trauma may experience difficulty feeling sensations during sexual experiences. Women may have an inability to have an orgasm.
