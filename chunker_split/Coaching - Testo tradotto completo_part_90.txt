When the Zen manager reads a letter, he truly reads a letter, and when he takes part in a meeting, he truly participates in the meeting, and so on. As for the non-Zen manager, when he reads a letter he is thinking of the meeting, when he attends the meeting he is ruminating about what he is going to do thereafter, and so on and so forth. The former is obviously endowed with greater effectiveness than the latter. Even Raja Yoga, which is the Royal Yoga, draws a lot of attention to this concept of the benefit entailed by the knowledge of how to avoid dispersions. We already know that the thought is a force, and that whatever is not applied to the thing which one has to focus his thought on, is accordingly a wasted strength that has been dissipated forever. “When you carry out some physical action — you will waste away your strength and your thought so long as you are thinking of something radically different. Before you plunge a needle into a cushion, you would have projected outside your being the thought, in essence, a plan for thrusting this needle. This plan is a force.
