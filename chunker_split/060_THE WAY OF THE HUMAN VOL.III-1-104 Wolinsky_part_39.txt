How will I know that I exist if this person isn't witnessing me, what significance does my life have? And where it's come up around my mother. I don't have her to call up and say, "Oh boy this is what it was like going through the past and all that." In the past, I think there would have been more sense, did I really experience that if I couldn't have that person as a witness. So if we go with this, "how do I exist if I don't have this person there?" Is that correct? Yeah, there's an element of that. How do I exist if this person is not there? What have been the consequences in your life to have the structure that says "how do I exist if this person is not there?" I had to keep that person right here all the time. I had to keep creating them. I did that with my father for 18 years. Constantly having that person there to prove my existence and to prove my love for them or to prove their importance of their existence to me. It's both ways. What's happening now?
