That was the beginning of an experiential journey which alternated satisfactions and failures, until, all of a sudden, he realized that he was going nowhere and that he was possibly escaping from something. He knew what he did not want, fine, but he did not really know where he wanted to go.

What is the use of all the studies of technical analysis and all the market tools if, ultimately, the decisions are conditional on one's varying moods and as such dictated by them? Could an automatic trading system be the solution?
