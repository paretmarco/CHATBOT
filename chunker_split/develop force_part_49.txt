25: body flexibility Exercise Another very valuable exercise to maintain the elasticity of the torso is to put hands on the hips, and turn body from right to left. In this way, we avoid tensions that could block the energy. Exercise 26: head They also rotate their heads from right to left. It is indeed up to the neck, which often create tension which can block the energy. Even more effective is the rotation is made before bringing back the head. Exercise: 27. Resume exercises of presence indicated previously In our book, Mesmerismus and "Trance" there are many exercises are useful for this purpose. At this point, we are ready for the "exercises for hemispheres" that are symbolically linked to polarities in humans. Probably a school of this type, connected with the development of the power of gaze, is probably present in Italy even since pre-Roman eras, which would explain how there are still many people who know and practice this technique. The Etruscans had in fact represented the eye on many everyday objects. Moreover, their winged deity in the symbology below implies the same concepts of the exercise that we will be presenting shortly. In it, we may see how the power of breathing (represented by the wing, which is the element of air) relates to the eye. At the same time we see clearly how this is a force, represented by the sword. The two aquatic tails show clearly the dual aspect behind this energy.
