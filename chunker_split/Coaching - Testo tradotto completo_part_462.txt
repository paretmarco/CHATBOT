The main reason why most people do not achieve what they are aiming at, in fact, is the circumstance that they do not actually know what it is that they want. The future is an unknown variable, and the only thing we can know for sure is whatever has taken place until the current moment. History teaches us a wealth of different things, and all that has occurred in the markets up to the present day can be analyzed by us in such a way that we might discern, at the root of those events, the existence of underlying conditions which statistically granted us a chance to score gains. One gets an abundance of persons who engage in trading and wish never to experience failure in any one of their operations; the market, instead, has its own rules and drives on in terms of its own rules. We are, therefore, the component who is required to adapt to it. It is difficult, for a person who engages in trading, to set for himself a goal which is disconnected from money.
