2) Re-inhale to the left keeping closed the right nostril 3) Exhale right while closing the left nostril 4) Keep on doing it You can add a particular respiratory rhythm in the exercise above, or run it just as well. Presence to head sides with the two seconds’ rhythm Be aware of the right side of the head, and then of the left one. Continue alternating for a short time. Follow with presence at the front of the head and the back of the head. Continue with the top of the head and the bottom. As you develop a stronger Central, you will feel increasingly centered on you. The rate shall be the following: a second to right and a second to left, repeating for some times, then a second ahead and a second back, repeating for several times too, and similarly for top and bottom. This rhythm according to the researches of Prof. Lefebure improves brain and opens the way to the psychic faculties. In particular the exercise above will enable you to rekindle the "central fire" whenever is about to become extinct. Symbolism of Caduceus repeats what was said earlier about the reported Etruscan deity. The two snakes symbolize the side energies, and the Central stick corresponds to the Central energy. Ernest Rossi, "The mind-body Biology" Respirazione per dominare le polarità La nostra respirazione, senza che noi ce ne accorgiamo, passa alternativamente da una narice all'altra. Il ricercatore Ernest Rossi[1] ha osservato come questo alternarsi segua dei ritmi specifici e corrisponda al differente attivarsi dei due emisferi cerebrali.
