It is in other words important to define certain temporal moments in which we carry out some specific operation, with a view never to reaching breaking point. Two principles are essential in this regard: 1. The principle of oscillation and rhythm 2. The principle of effort The principle of oscillation: Nothing is constant in the world. Even as regards the energy field, it would be more correct to speak of “wave” and “flux”. One of the essential aspects consists in alternating periods of activity with periods of rest. In order to maintain a strong energy, we inevitably need to learn how to spend our energy rhythmically. Energy which is managed cyclically (alternation) is far stronger than linear energy (concentration without any rest). The principle of the effort: In order to create capacity and to acquire ever greater efficacy, we must transcend our ordinary limit, the way athletes do, and to subsequently grant ourselves some periods of rest. In order to apply this principle of oscillation effectively, it might be useful to work in a “multidimensional” way, by examining the physical, mental and emotional dimensions of man.
