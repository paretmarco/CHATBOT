In Quantum Psychology we are not talking about "acting it out" as if imagining expressing sexuality equals liberationâ€”as some gurus suggest. We are not talking about the repression-expression continuum. We are talking about taking the label off and being with the energy of it. Many forms of therapy consider substitution a "good" thing. For Quantum Psychology, substitution can be repressing some basic animal drive and substituting it for some socially acceptable behavior. For example, let's say when you expressed sexuality as a child, you were rebuked by your parents but when you expressed interests in achievement and success, you were rewarded. You then substitute sexual impulse for achievement. Some say this is "good." Quantum Psychology suggests two major pitfalls: That the achievement never reaches a state of satisfaction or completion (climax). 2.The repressed-substituted sexual impulse comes out in other ways. First of all, substitution yields no satisfaction, it only yields more escalating substitution (i.e., driving for more and more success). Secondly, as homeopathic medicine suggests, sexual and other impulses do not go away with substitution but create a supression and sometimes a perversion of symptoms, since the energy must come out in some way.
