We move from self-to-other in present time, to child-to-parents in past time. The inner child becomes the hypnotist making suggestions to the present-time adult, who is the subject. In doing this, we lose our connection with the other person and the present world and hence feel lonely, misunderstood, and alienated. AB Illustration #2 Age Regression + 31 In illustration #2 we see the inner child of person B hypnotizing the internalized parent in person A. Interestingly, the inner child of person A is hypnotizing the parent of person B. This is trance- ference, and counter trance-ference, and is the cornerstone of problem states that occur in relationships. In the former example, where the woman goes into the "I'm not smart enough" a inner child trance, she probably will pick a man who treats her that way. This mutual inner child trance between her and her husband possibly might be a re-creation of both her inner child and his inner-child family trance. (See Illustration 2.) The inner child's trance becomes frozen or created by a series of interpersonal interactions in the family, which take over individual experiences of NOW.
