Also, the child places no evaluations on things, such as this is better than that. Further, the observer places no significance on what it observes, such as, because this happens, it means this about me or about who I am. The observer however, does begin to make creative decisions. First, this is my body, and that is their body. Later on, the parents begin to reward and punish, giving the child their judgements, evaluations, and significances about what life is, should be, could be, or what things mean. The observer becomes the creator and adapts by pushing the record button, tape-recording the parents voices, and taking a picture of a time frozen child who will hold onto these voices. For example, a parent may say to the child, "You should never trust people." The observerlcreator takes a photocopy (picture) and creates a child within who records these voices. Many of the voices we have in our heads about who or what we are, are the taped duplications of our parents' voices held within the frozen inner child. The observer has a blank audio tape with the record button on.
