Our partner looks a certain way, and suddenly we are drenched in a sea of emotions. This is the dark side of the inner child, an automatic response pattern, which overwhelms us, making the present look like the past. Age regression, or feeling younger than you are, is the corner- stone of the wounded child identity. Here, the observer takes a picture of a traumatic incident and holds that picture (memory) of this little child going through a trauma. The picture records the look, the pain, the feelings. Whenever anything resembles the picture, the dark side of the inner child takes over, reproducing memories and feelings that have little to do with present time reality. In short, the dark side of the inner child projects the past incident onto the present situation. Age regression is the most widely experienced trance and relates directly to a time frozen experience that was uncomfortable and too confusing or chaotic for the child to experience and integrate completely; hence, the observer resisted the experience, causing the memory of what occurred to freeze.
