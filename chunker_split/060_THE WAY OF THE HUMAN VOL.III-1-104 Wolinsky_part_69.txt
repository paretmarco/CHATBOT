If you are not using them, you are in pure beingâ€”or what Nisargadatta Maharaj would call I AM, the no-state, the stateless state of the non-being being. It should be noted that the NON-VERBAL I AM uses no lenses or frames; hence, the NON-VERBAL I AM has no frames of reference, no references to frame. Throughout most of the trilogy we have been looking at psychology and spirituality through various lenses.' But when the NONVERBAL I AM is revealed, all lenses, all diagnoses, all frames are seen as just maps, gone beyond and dissolve, leaving you with no frames of reference and no references to frame. ESSENCE has Essential qualities, such as love with no object, compassion, observation with no object, etc. ESSENCE is the end point for some forms of spiritual practice. One of Nisargadatta Maharaj's major teachings was, "Hold onto this I AM (No-State state) and let go of everything else." Quantum Psychology can only imagine that it was his way of cutting through the False Core-False Self. Being with Nisargadatta Maharaj, this experience of the NON-VERBAL I AM and BEYOND was transmittable and transmitted from "him" to "you."
