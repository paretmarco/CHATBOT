In this case, it is the Minotaur, the unwanted child born out of wedlock. At a deeper level, however, it is the problem of separation, i.e. imagining sex and the fruit of sex (the Minotaur) as separate from everything else (i.e., the underlying unity). Children born out of wedlock are called bastards, certainly a derogatory term. From a family therapy perspective to save the marriage, the Minotaur (the by-product of separation and sexuality) is considered an evil bastard and is sent by Minos (who now has fallen and experiences sexuality separate from himself and the underlying unity) to a Labyrinth (the syrilbol for the divided or unconscious mind). A Labyrinth (unconscious mind) is outside of the view of awareness and is a maze, which, once entered into is near impossible to "get out" of. There, within the depths of the unconscious mind (Labyrinth), is placed the Minotaur (sexuality). Hidden from the world, Minos is now separate, obsessed (unconsciously) by the sexuality that the Minotaur represents, and unconsciously fixated on it.
