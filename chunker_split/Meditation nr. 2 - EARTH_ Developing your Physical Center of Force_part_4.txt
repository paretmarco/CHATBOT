Most probably all psychoactive drugs have an e ect on the ENS. Furthermore, current research about the ENS seems to have found correspondences to the ethnomedical concept of the lower Dantian (traditional Asian medicine), Swadhisthana (Hindu Trantrism), and the Sacral orange-colored chakra (New Age). This center is the key of access to the ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM also called ENS. ENS controls the gastrointestinal system in humans. It contains 100 million neurons, and the brain contains ~100 billion (±20%). It is located in the gastrointestinal area. The ENS can be considered part of the collective whole called the autonomic nervous system (ANS), but also as an independent system of its own. ANS controls various systems, including the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, urinary, reproductive, and integumentary (hair, skin, nails)—all of which are considered to function below the level of consciousness. The CNS and ENS are in strong communication with one another (via the BGA, brain–gut axis), and similar neurotransmitters can be found in both. The neuroplasticity of the ENS has not yet been studied.Medical studies of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) analyze the role of the brain–gut axis (BGA) in detail. It seems that the BGA is involved in various important physiological processes (regulation of glucose and fat metabolism, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and even in bone metabolism).
