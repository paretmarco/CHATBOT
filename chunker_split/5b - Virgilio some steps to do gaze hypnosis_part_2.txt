standing, back of the feet touching themselves What do you do at the begin? I widen my gaze. I call this action "taking control of the room". In this way my peripheral view get more open and my whole brain begins working. To be sure I'm widening my gaze I imagine the subject becoming smaller. I do also some specific exercises for this task before even seeing the person. And after? I imagine a colour. Everything of this colour. This action will put my right brain also in action as my right brain is very sensible to colours. And after? At the same time I breath in. And breathing I feel I'm getting the energy of the person upfront. After I will hold my breathing during the whole exercise. Only at certain moments, when I will feel without air I will very fast breath in. And what you do also? I move my hand with the finger pointed doing a circle clockwise in face of the person and for putting the hand away I change the direction of the motion, this will put his third eye chakra in action. Why you touch his kin?
