The system, applied exactly as described by Braid, corresponded only in a very small part to what in reality the magnetizer of this time did, and Lafontaine himself in his book "l'art de magnetiser" said it, but the word has remained without any plausible reason and has dethroned the more exact term of somnambulism. In any case Braid brought attention to some physiological facts and acknowledged the main importance of the eye to get an altered state. Magnetism in any case, meant a strong departure from the traditional medical paradigm. Therefore in most medical societies Animal Magnetism wasn't well accepted and it got strong condemnation pronounced by the scientific societies and particularly by the Academy of Medicine of Paris, which in 1842 had solemnly declared that the whole thing was only a tissue of frauds and impostures. Hardly would at this time a doctor admit the possibility of even inducing sleep. Some dissenting opinions in any case manifested themselves even between medical men.
