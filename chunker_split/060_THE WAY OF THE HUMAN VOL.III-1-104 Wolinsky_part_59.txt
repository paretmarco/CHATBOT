Debra:Well, that the world is a place that doesn't respond to me, doesn't think I am important enough or worthwhile enough. Therapeutic Note For an infant, their parents are the world. Therefore, the six-step defusion process. Wolinsky:If you fuse together world and parents, what are you resisting? Debra:I'm resisting people who don't pay attention to me. Wolinsky:If you separate world and parents, what are you creating? Debra:Well, it is just knowing, it doesn't matter if some- body doesn't pay attention to me. That will get even with your parents? I'll show them. Can you say I will prove to you that I will have worth? ________________ Debra:My solar plexus. Wolinsky:So look at your parents over there. Who modeled (one or both of them) worthless? Debra:Both of them. Yeah. I will prove to you that I have worth. I've been doing it for years. By being successful, by having men in my life, by everything I do and none of it works. Prove to them that I am worthwhile. They just don't get it.
