Lastly, if a conversation requires some kind of concatenation, one must always be careful not to reply too automatically. When you give expression to an idea, you ought to ponder the meaning of every word, and to avoid using more words than those needed to asseverate that idea 13. If we throw a glance at history, we will find that though successful people used to keep their acting well-focused, they always exerted a strong impression on the environments around them. As with an image drawn against a white background, their acting and being always seemed to be clear and with neat contours. We in fact perceive as "magnetic" a person whose way of acting is confident and coordinated, and who evinces self-mastery. These attributes of “self-conviction” have a tendency to coincide with the fact that the person we are facing expresses himself in a self-consistent manner at all levels of communication and throughout the different areas of his mind. Accordingly, he thinks only of one thing, motions the eyes and the hands in a harmoniously consistent fashion, and exudes self-coherence in every one of his acts.
