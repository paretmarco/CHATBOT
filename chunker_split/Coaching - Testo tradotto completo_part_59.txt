Some people have asserted that the human mind has not ceased to be the mind of the caveman: The man whose aim is not to attain any goal, but to survive and preserve the “status quo”. Other people choose instead to speak of “comfort zone”. Our mind is forever inclined to be stuck in the same “comfort zone”, that is, to repeat what it already knows, purely because it is simpler for him. The goal of the brain ought to be the one of adapting to the environment and working out creative solutions. If the brain is left to itself, however, it will after a while keep on repeating earlier patterns. Oftentimes, thoughts get reiterated even after they have ceased to be useful, nay, even thoughts which never proved to be useful are repeated in this fashion. As for the person who derives satisfaction from life, he is able to assign a purpose to the work which the brain engages in. In order to pilot it, however, it is necessary to be conscious of the way in which the brain operates. Achieving results in our life is thus obligatorily dependent on us gradually attaining self-mastery 10.
