On each day of your life, you should first create a state of emotional calm, and follow that up by saying to yourselves: "What am I going to do today in order to approximate the ideal I have set for myself?”. The duty you are going to envision, as you pose the said question to yourselves, should not be something abstract. It must be a concrete vision of your duty in this regard: Doing this, doing that, doing this before tackling that, but in any case doing, as opposed to you thinking of doing. Today’s activity must be connected, at least partially, to the ones of yesterday and tomorrow; otherwise you will walk through life as an inebriated person, incapable as such of moving forward. It is here that the beneficial usefulness of the plan lies. Once, however, — the general orientation of your daily activity has been demarcated —, you should stop worrying about what you are going to do next.
