We can observe how this exercise encompasses two levels of coenesthetic perception 105: The first one, comprising sensations, is pure, whereas the second one is located in the body which manages to find its balance and true position. Finally, this kind of presence might become connected to energy sensations. Exercise 54 – The enumeration Another interesting exercise consists in enumerating whatever one is doing 106. For example: I am turning the steering wheel to the right, I am pressing on the accelerator, etc. This exercise must be embarked upon at the initial stage, so as to augment one’s consciousness, not only the perceptive one but even the consciousness of what one is busy doing. After such initial stage, one should of course stop talking while he acts. We must of course take care not to confuse this exercise with a form of materialization. We are in fact dealing here with primary descriptions rather than with reflections, with concrete facts 107.
