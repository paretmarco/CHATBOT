"When" THAT ONE SUBSTANCE contracts you get the universal concept of archetypes a by-product of the physics divisions which is that which archetypes of the collective unconscious are made (Volume III). The Collective Dimension forms and creates our deepest Archetype, the Archetype and concept of the I AM. As the No-State The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness State of I AM contracts further ESSENCE appears. With further contraction the personal unconscious, the body (nervous system), the external world, and the personal conscious mind are made manifest. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: What is true at one level may not be true at another level. So let's begin by differentiating so that we can go beyond each dimension of manifestation in order to liberate awareness (which had become fixated) within each dimension and then to go beyond even awareness and the awarER itself (to be discussed later). DEVELOPING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS As mentioned earlier the most frequently asked question is, "How do I maintain my humanness and awareness of my body while keeping spiritually connected?" The possible answer might lie in the ability to develop and maintain multi-dimensional awareness. This means first becoming aware of how and where you place your awareness.
