Unbeknownst to your friends, you are phobic about actually being in the water, and you begin to panic and feel like you are drowning (phobia trance). You survive this ordeal, pack up and begin to walk home, whereupon you come across a teenager trying to give away several kittens. You stop dead in your tracks, pick up one of the kittens and begin talking like a five-year-old. You are so enchanted by the kitten that you spend 30 minutes there, talking "kitty-talk" and being completely oblivious to the time (kitty trance). You get home and promptly get into a fight with your partner in which you both scream and yell for 30 minutes because you were late (fight trance). Then you make up and cuddle, kiss, and tell each other how much you love one another for an hour (love trance). There are two common factors in all of these trance experiences. The first is that each one had a beginning point, a middle, and an endpoint â€” which means that you are the one common factor in the comings and goings of these particular trances.
