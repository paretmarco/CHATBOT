In addition, the abovementioned method has an impact on chance, and you will discover that events which are often unexpected will lend you a helping hand. Developing more than one path We have conferred the name “ideal” on what represents the exteriorization, on the level of the imagination, of your initial impulse. One aspect we would like to draw your attention to is the inclination towards unique, grandiose and inflexible conceptions. What we recommend in this regard is to avoid building up a level which is like a single long flight of stairs leading to one top exclusively. You should rather be knowledgeable in the art of dreaming frequently and gladly. For the sake of granting satisfaction to the mind, in the light of the right and correlated duty which each one of us has to look beyond the fence, we would advice you to devise a project which is centred on traversing different paths and studying new combinations, by driving forward the analysis of the most daring dreams with the same calm with which you would approach the most trivial realities. Why would that preclude, in fact, the materialization of something good? You should multiply your conscious forces through the help of the unconscious.
