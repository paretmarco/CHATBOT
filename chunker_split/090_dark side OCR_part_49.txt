In India (see Chapter 14, "Spiritualization") they believe that saying what you want or even wanting is the source of all human problems. In many situations, the child learns how to get what is wanted not by asking directly, but rather by acting indirectly. This is often modeled by Mom and Dad, who show the child how to get what is wanted without asking. The parents can model this manipulation, and years later the child within the adult gets angry at a spouse because the spouse doesn't "mind read" the inner child's signals. Complaints in a relationship occur often times because the spouse doesn't know what is wanted, since it wasn't asked for. I once had a client who was working on his relationship with his mother. I asked, "What do you want from her?" The inner child responded, "I wanted her to give me everything I wanted, whenever I wanted it, without having to ask." The adult saw how out of line the inner child' s demand was and was able to let it go. Cutting off our feelings is traumatic.
