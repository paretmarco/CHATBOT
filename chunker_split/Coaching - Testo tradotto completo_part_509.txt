In the world of finance or in the realm of economics, every assertion which is capable of being expressed through paradigms of cause and effect can only possess validity at the level of probabilities 114. In the field of human behaviour, and thus in the market, one will always come across expressions which are traced to the fact that such an operational arena encompasses factors that are independent and not susceptible of being repeated. The financial markets are in the last analysis a form of human expression, and it is thus unthinkable that today the identical events which took place yesterday shall be re-enacted. If, therefore, we apply deterministic, i.e. excessively sequential theories, in the arena of finance, we will reach a stalemate sooner or later, or even worse, we will plunge into a loss. There is another fact, however, which is likewise undeniable, namely: No human mind is capable of logically analysing the entire multiplicity of market variables in a sufficiently short time as to enable it to take a decision. In spite if that, there are traders who earn REALLY A LOT on a constant basis. The other people say of them that â€œthey are endowed with an intuitive acumen".
