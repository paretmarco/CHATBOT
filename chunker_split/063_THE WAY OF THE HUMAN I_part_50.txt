But if you do not acknowledge how your awareness is chronically fixated, then no matter what beautiful experiences you have of ESSENCE or the VOID (samadhi) during meditation, when you come out and open your eyes, talk to your relationship, your boss, etc., you are going to get smacked in the face with your own concepts. In other words, your issues will all come up again. ESSENCE AM COLLECTIVE-ARCHETYPICAL NOT-I-I VOID NAMELESS ABSOLUTE BEYOND THE QUESTION The most commonly asked question is, "Why is Multi-Dimensional Awareness—and specifically, the awareness of ESSENCE, I AM, etc.—unknown to us?" "Why aren't they available?" The answer seems to be that if all of your awareness is fixated on thoughts and emotions around the False Core-False Self concept—for example, "I am inadequate," etc.—then there is no awareness left to be aware of ESSENCE, I AM, etc. In other words our awareness is gobbled up by that fixation in this one arena (dimension) and cannot become stabilized in any of the other dimensions. Simply stated, awareness that is fixated on a particular dimension cannot be liberated. But this tendency disappears and awareness which is chronically ensnared becomes liberated.
