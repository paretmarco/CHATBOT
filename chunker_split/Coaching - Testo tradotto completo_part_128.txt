If softening automatism is carried out by us in a methodical fashion, by making an effort to first dominate the insignificant impulses and later to move to the attempt of dominating the most significant ones, while at the same time seeking to be present to ourselves, that will progressively ensure the prompt and smooth subjugation of automatism to the representations made by thoughtful reflection, and will further guarantee the development of a central principle in man. It consists in regaining control of our selves, and of gestures and movements which would otherwise be guided by the subconscious. SELF-REMEMBRANCE Being present to oneâ€™s own self is the straight path one has to tread in order to rise above automatism and unconsciousness, and accordingly soar to the higher levels in which we might find the totality of our potentialities, both the conscious and the unconscious one, to be within our reach. A tangible example which embodies the opposite reality is the situation where we make a promise, either to ourselves or to other people, and then, only a few seconds afterwards, we have already consigned it to oblivion.
