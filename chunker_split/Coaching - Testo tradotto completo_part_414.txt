An essential role in the process of retrieving one’s power and mental clarity is played by the process of de-mystifying. How much energy do we indeed spend in the construction, and even more so in the maintenance, of our individual reality and our array of habits? Scientific researches have indeed shown that an adult is engaged in some kind of mental work even during the moments of quiet. The assumption has been put forward that such an incessant functioning is designed to “construct reality”. What we call "reality" is, therefore, as a matter of ordinary business, a construction of thoughts, though one which stays unaltered, since average man is afraid of chaos and the uncertain. Presence leads us to have conscious realization of such a fact. Presence is indeed devoid of any investment, since one finds in it consciousness of the present. Presence is what guides us to the essential layer which underpins consciousness. Some techniques approximate the actualization thereof, insofar as they succeed in demystifying several things 101. An additionally important element is to make our objectives clear to ourselves. Presence, however, goes even further, as it works on a non-verbal level as well.
