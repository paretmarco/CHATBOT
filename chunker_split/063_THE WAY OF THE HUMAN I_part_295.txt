What I did was to keep differentiating her present time body and person from the three year old body image of a little girl which she was identified with and operating out of unknowing. The question always is, Is she experiencing her body image in present time or through a past time body image which she is unknowingly acting out of in present time? If someone were overweight as a child, are they seeing themselves in present time or through the past-time body image? When you chip away at the False Core (see also Volume II), you are going to get somatic reactions. This happens because your past time body images and stresses are going to move to the foreground and be given up so that you can live out of a present time body image or, better yet, no body image. ________________ Chapter VIII DESIRES AND SUBSTITUTIONS When Nisargadatta Marahaj got up in the morning I'm sure he had the biological desire to shit, the biological desire to eat, etc. It's all part of what desires are. Desires become a problem when you are in substitution.
