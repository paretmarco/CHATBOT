Dissociation. In a state of dissociation, we detach ourselves from one part of us. We might, for instance, be unable to feel our own sensations. An example from daily life of a person in such a condition is one who cannot experience emotions at all. 2. Positive hallucination, which might for instance cause us to perceive people around us being different from what they really are. In that event, such phenomenon will coincide with the one which is termed "transference". 3. Progression in the future, to wit, one which, in its pathological varieties, corresponds to imaginations distancing us from reality. 4. Daily imaginations, being the type which keeps us fixed in another dimension. It is the hypnotic dream preventing us from being in the here and now: The relevant person is “lost in the clouds”. 5. Hypermnesia, i.e. focusing in an excessive manner on past moments. This occurs for instance in cases of traumas when a person declares himself “unable to forget”. 6. Temporal distortion, which makes us lose awareness of the fact that time passes, and which precludes us from accomplishing our objectives.
