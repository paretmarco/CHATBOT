Always congratulate your client once the deal has been struck and he has placed with you the order; remain behind to chat with him for a while, become his friend, and, before you bide him farewell, ask him to supply you with a list of «active references». The energy and resoluteness you are going to utilize while you do your sales will have turned out to be fully successful: No one will possibly be able to counter your will, which has been moulded and trained to perfection; you have become the owners of a power, of a live and real force which, the more it earns your confidence, the more it will assist you in routing any adversity or discomforting opposition. This will open up all roads for you and succeed in demolishing iron walls, until such stage when neither chance nor destiny might debar or restrict your hypnotic power. Enthusiasm combined with an open smile, organizational skills wedded to competence, sincerity, lavishing appreciative remarks and praises, and the exteriorised actualization of your steely resolution, this big hypnotic X-factor, will all converge so as to enable you to conclude any deal in a short period of time.
