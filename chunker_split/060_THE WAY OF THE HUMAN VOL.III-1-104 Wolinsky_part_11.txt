The problem is that, as the physical body organizes around the pure spaciousness of ESSENCE, the awareness of ESSENCE and the I AM diminishes as identities are formed to aid in the survival of the body . Observers, too, are formed to enable the physical body to survive (see Tao of Chaos). With the loss of the Essential qualities of ESSENCE, you lose the access to "your deepest self." The False Core-False Self and identities attempt unsuccessfully to capture, externally (i.e., in the external dimension) what ESSENCE is and contains—and which you already are. Metaphorically speaking, the False Self identities face outward looking for things such as love (or fill in the blank) from the external dimension. For this reason, the False Self and its identities are doomed to failure because they are collapsing dimensions. These identities are trying to get from the external dimension that which is contained within the Essential dimension. In other words, they are searching for Essential qualities like unconditional love in the external dimension or compassion in the thinking or emotional dimension. Other dimensions—thinking, emotional, etc.—cannot experience ESSENCE since this is not their function. Only ESSENCE can experience Essential Qualities.
