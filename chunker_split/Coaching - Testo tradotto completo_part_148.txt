One does not reason with lunatics or drunkards. What one has to do in this context is to let the nerves be restored to their normal state. The problem, here, resembles the one of bringing back to rest the strings of an instrument that has been violently plucked. Two procedures exist for that purpose. Through the first such procedure, which is the more natural one of the two, all that one has to do is to let vibrations turn progressively shorter until complete stasis is reached. Rest is something which materializes without fail. It is only a question of time as to when it will set in. Based on that, one procedure (which is actually a form of not proceeding to do anything) for quenching emotion, is let it flow out of one’s own self by acquiring conscious awareness of one’s body and, if necessary, by carrying out some breathing exercises, whereupon the nervous fluid is dispersed at every moment, until quiet is reached. One single warning must however be necessarily be borne in mind in such instance: Do not accumulate the motivational causes which might keep the emotional state alive.
