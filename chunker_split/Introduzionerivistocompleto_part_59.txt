You would have acquired the technique of consciously working on yourself, therefore, you would always be the craftsmen of your own progress. Obviously, you need to add a different mental approach, a more joyous way of seeing life almost as if it was a game. Remember, a person who is a “possibilist” is a positive person who has enormous internal energy, making him/ her active and capable even when faced with problems, for s/he can find winning strategies to solve them. Dedicate 10% to the problem and 90% to the solution. Take control of your life!!!! PART EIGHT: IL R.E.I. R.E.I., or Emotional Release, is a powerful technique for emotional problem resolving. It is based on new principles, which can be added to what has already been discussed up until now on NLP, Hypnosis and Enneagram, improving the finished result. Since this is a new subject, we advise you to visit our web site or telephone us on 348-3053013. WHY CHOOSE THESE NEW METHODS? “Because nothing exists outside of yourself that can have control over what is inside of you”. (W.W.Dyer) Unlike other models or psychologies, NLP and the other methods outlined here work on revealed behavior. As well as providing a different conception of the person and therefore the discomfort, the group of models suggested by these methods allow for the participation on a therapeutic, educative and preventative level in a controllable and measurable way.
