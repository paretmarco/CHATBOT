It is at this difficult juncture when the individual first fully appreciates his separation, deals emotionally with the impact of that reality, and is called upon to integrate his magnificence with his vulnerability. This rapprochement with reality represents the individual's first attempt to reconcile an idealized dream, which includes the illusions of symbiosis and grandiosity, with the realities of existence, which include separateness and limitation (Ibid., p. 41) The narcissist's salvation is not in his accomplishments, specialness, or uniqueness. The "drama of the gifted child" (Miller, 1981) is in his discovery of his human orditiariness. In that ordinariness is his ability to feel real human feelings unaffected by his internalized (or externalized) parents' acceptance or rejection of his feelings. Once his ordinariness is realized, he can express his gift as just that--a gift. His gift is not who he is but humanness is who he is. (Ibid. p. 49) ________________ Special Section In Quantum Psychology, true spirituality is to be aware of the underlying unity, aware of your ESSENCE, aware of your psycho-emotional nature, aware of your animal nature and aware of the external world, etc.
