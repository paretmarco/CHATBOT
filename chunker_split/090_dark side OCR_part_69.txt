The dark side of the inner child alleviates emotional stress but functions without feedback from the real world. The child within the adult thinks the fantasy is reality. It' s not that the inner child is wrong or bad, but just that what worked at ages two through six does not work at age 36. 42 4- The Dark Side of the Inner Child At first, futurizing is dependent on the events of early life. Problems arise when futurizing becomes autonomous, has a life of its own. It acts on its own, independently, being cut adrift from its original source, the family. In this way fantasies arise on their own, and people live life fantasizing about the future, rather than expe- riencing "now." Another trance form associated with futurizing occurs when the individual creates self-talk, an internal dialogue (see Chapter 7, Inner Dialogue). "I never get what I want," is an example. Not only is now catastrophic for the child, but the future also is imagined as catastrophic. This orientation is a combination of age regression, in which the past is "fixed," but also the past pain is trance-fered to the future.
