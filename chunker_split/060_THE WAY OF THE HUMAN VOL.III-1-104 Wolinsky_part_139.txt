This is not created out of a disso6ation caused by resisting a present-time experience. The pain or pleasure occurs when we do not appreciate the Archetypical pattern, but rather fuse with it, identify with it, imagine it is us and hence "act it out," either externally in the world or by trying to integrate a part of us (which is also an Archetype). Repressed spiritualization (creating a false spirituality through denial or repression), is from the personal bottom to a deeper bottom a personal unconscious dissociative spiritual which is more solid rigidified and defended not from the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (top) down. To illustrate this False Archetypical developmental distortion, VOID—*superstrings--+ Physics Dimensions-4collective unconsciousness and Archetypes--+ personal unconsciousness—►ersonal conscious mind—►more unconscious mind---dissociative spiritual. In other words, with repressed spirituality, it is from the bottom to a more solidified dissociated bottom—if I don't like my mother, the personal "I" represses and moves from the bottom down and uses spiritualization as a defense. This is not an Archetype but rather a fotiti of repression which gives the illusion of an Archetype. With a true Archetype things go from the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS to solidity.
