Because my inner defenses are acting so quickly that I will get a sense of something like a spark and then it will be like a box going over me. To harness and contain the primal energy. Right and it is faster than what I can verbalize or feel, the first part, before it gets contained. Let me make sure I understand. So there is a spark but instantaneously there is a containment of the spark. ________________ Therapeutic Note: Here I assumed thatian internalized mother was the container for her spark. Nancy:It happened real fast. The containment feels like a box, like a coffin almost. I feel numb. And yet, in my genital area, there is a little bit of energy that the coffin didn't get. Wolinsky:So when you had energy as a kid, it was like your mother tried to bury it, and tried to put you in a coffin and bury you. Nancy:Yes. Wolinsky:What I would like for you to do is to have an im- age of mom over there (another physical location) as an undertaker. And I would like for you to have this coffin next to mom, the undertaker.
