They come "after the experience" to explain what and/or why something, which has already occurred, occurred. 133 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Reasons and their accompanying beliefs are just that. They occur at the thinking dimension but are a by-product of the nervous system and can only give reasons and justifications much later for what has already occurred in the past. Furthermore, the reasons and justifications are further away from reality (the experience itself) and hence, more disconnected from what is. Still, even though these are Quantum Psychological Principles, we will have to meet the problem at the level of the problem in order to understand the BIOLOGICAL CORE and what Quantum Psychology calls BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION. THE BIOLOGICAL CORE: THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF ESSENCE The development of awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE seems to be one of the "slowest" for two reasons: First, because it is in physical matter (as opposed to a thought or a feeling), it is denser. Second, the present time demands of our industrial society force us to lose awareness of our biology and push us beyond what a body can do.
