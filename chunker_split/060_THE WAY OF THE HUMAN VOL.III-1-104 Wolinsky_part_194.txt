Allow that power with no object to be reabsorbed into the EMPTINESS. Go further into the VOID and allow the EMPTINESS to condense down into a representation of truth and wisdom with no subject/object. Take the label off and reasborb that into the EMPTINESS. Allow the EMPTINESS to condense down and form a configuration, condensation representing connection or connectedness with no subject/object. Take the label off and allow that connection with no subject/object to be reabsorbed into the EMPTINESS. Allow awareness to expand further and further into the VOID and allow the VOID to condense down and form the EMPTINESS of observation with no object. Once again, take the label off, allow that observation with no object to be reabsorbed into the EMPTINESS. Go further into the VOID.
