Often with incest survivors, the child creates beliefs like, "I made it happen." If I'm seductive, it will happen; if I'm not, it won't. I'm in charge of turning him/her on." or "I' m Spiritualizing + 129 special because I am so powerful." All of these cognitions resist the powerlessness of the situation. The child, to avoid the chaos and pain, goes into a trance of making herself feel powerful, in charge, rather than acknowledging she was powerless, and the abuser was in charge. The cognition helps protect her from being overwhelmed by the emotions of powerlessness, feeling helpless, and victimization. Adult Problem State: Rigidity. Here the adult is being hypnotized by the inner child to control his feelings, thoughts, and expressions as a way to be loved. Often the child within the adult will try to control everyone else' s feelings, thoughts, or expressions. Their emotional rigidity prevents them from feeling their vulnerability and need for love. The rigidity allows them to believe they can live without love, or can withdraw love to control people.
