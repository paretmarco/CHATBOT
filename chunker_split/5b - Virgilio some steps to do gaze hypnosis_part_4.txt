No after a moment I look at his lunar (moon) eye, the left one. Do you do it how many times? Two times. How is your face at the moment tense and the teeth will touch themselves How is your body in this moment? Tense, and the hand gives energy to the solar plexus that also is tense Are your arm tense? Yes And your legs? Yes Is tense similar to rigid? Not at all, you must be tense but not rigid. What you must do also You must be tense in the perineum, in order to give a flash of energy upward that it is what is called "kundalini" Do you imagine energy going out from you hand? Not at all, you know it is happening. What you do with you hands? I move them in a circular fashion (anticlockwise) And what you do after? You must have your thumb distant from the other fingers: this will confound the subject that will not see you coming closer How do you come closer? I must have my shoulder tenses and move my head forward. This will press a specific zone in the head (the cerebellum) activating some basic reactions And after?
