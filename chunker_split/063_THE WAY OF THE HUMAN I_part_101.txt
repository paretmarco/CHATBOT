Part of the reason traumas are so intense is that there's a collapsing of the dimensions. In other words, your external thinking, feeling and biology all get collapsed and stuck together. This is why a trauma, now labeled as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, is so powerful and hard to take apart (see The Tao of Chaos). 51 Chapter II THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS, THE ARCHETYPAL DIMENSION (VOLUME III) The Collective Unconscious is a condensation of THAT VOID. It contains the physics dimensions' of energy, space, mass, time, gravity, strong and weak nuclear forces, light and electro-magnetics. It is the "ground" of archetypes, and the birthplace of our "ruling" forces which lie far outside of awareness. For this reason, the physics dimensions must be processed too as we see how psycho-spirituality is a br-product of the interaction of the physics dimensions. Finally, the key archetype, the I AM is in this dimension. As Nisargadatta Maharaj said, "The I AM comes from the collective." THE NOT-I-I The "NOT-I-I" is where the WITNESS WITNESSes the observer-observed dyad with no effect.
