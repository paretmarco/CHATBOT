Path B of Human Development and Quantum Technologies If implemented wisely, following path B is positive and acts as a first useful step allowing a person to develop to its fullest potential and resources. This brochure will deal essentially with path B, as we do not believe that there are at this time a sufficient number of people able to deal directly via A. In addition, those who are not able to get results in life it is probable that they are in such a situation because they don’t have all of their resources. Therefore it is very unlikely they will have the energy required to follow the path A. But there is another even more important reason. In today’s world, we assist to the fact that there is a continuous search for way B procedures forgetting the man who practices them. Only a few techniques work in the best direction for the operator. While allowing you to achieve results in the short, or even in the medium term if we have in the mind a direction of development that is aligned only with contingent elements, instead that with the real and profound human nature, the risk of psychosomatic problems, or to move away from the center more and more is too high. Our method unlike any previous technology focuses on the doer rather than on the done. We think it therefore important to indicate a feasible and positive path. Three INNER STEPS FOR REAL development In our view, learning these techniques must be part of a path also and transformation of the human being.
