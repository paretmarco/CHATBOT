This kind of movement is very strange when perceived from the clients, as the fascinated subject is aware of being there but at the same time does not know in reality what he is doing. It is their unconscious, their animal mind, that excited begins to react and move the body. In a second she said: "I'm in a corridor, I'm walking". The scene became immediately clear and she also gave me all other details. Then we healed her negative emotions. From the beginning of the induction to this moment of the corridor 6 or 7 seconds were elapsed. You cannot realize an instant regression in so few seconds with verbal techniques, as these techniques rely on words and words need time to be said. Instead a big advantage of fascination is that this example is not the exception, it is the rule. Another interesting phenomenon is that many times we can get amnesia even after a very short span of time, more often than with any other method. Other uses are coupling fascination first and relaxation techniques afterwards. You will see that the relaxation will be the strongest one you had ever experienced.
