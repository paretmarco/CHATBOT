After writing what you want, readably and briefly, set yourself at ease and focus on your script, concentrating the thought with intensity, but calmly, on the meaning of the lines you have on sight. Breathe deeply and slowly. The procedure just described bases on the theory that by this means you get to produce in a perfect way some mental streams in full strength. Another explanation could come by considering the quantum nature of reality, or by the principle of synchronicity stated the first time by Carl Gustav Jung. Those who finally want to adopt a fully psychological point of view may think that it works because we create a "matrix" in our unconscious mind that tends to facilitate the occurrence of certain events. If you at first express simple and reasonable wishes as to enjoy better health, mental abilities, a sweeter character, you will probably succeed immediately. Insofar as you exercise, you can do more precise and detailed questions, such as those that we have mentioned. Until you will not ask for something harmful, either directly or indirectly, for the rights and happiness of your neighbor, you will get a measure of success based on the sincerity and intelligence you will show following this procedure. Second Method The second method is that of solar plexus. The solar plexus is the large central nerve of the spinal cord, behind the stomach hollow. Some scientists claim that the solar plexus is a brain — the abdominal brain — and that has an influence not only on body functions like breathing and heartbeat, but also on the emotional nature of the individual.
