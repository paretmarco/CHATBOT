Gossen, who has studied the constituent elements of hedonometry, to wit, the laws to which prolonged or reiterated pleasures are subject, lays down the following rule as the essential general norm: «Any pleasure, through its iteration, has a lower initial intensity and a shorter duration than the first experiencing of it. Its intensity and time span decrease at a velocity which is commensurate with the increasingly rapid pace at which the repetitions thereof take place». The abovementioned law, after all, is merely one application of the more general law on repetition, which is a factor that enfeebles and discolours feeling. A pleasure, therefore, is such especially by virtue of its novelty. To put it in a condensed form, pleasure behaves in the same way as time does. Accordingly, it gets swallowed by routine and appears to vanish away after a while. The person who frequents theatre once a month is spontaneously inclined to think that the subscribers taste a pleasure comparable with his which is further multiplied by the number of shows they are specifically allowed to attend by their subscriptions. The truth, instead, is that the subscriber ... yawns!
