In other words, you are doing yoga from the outside—how do I look?—in. In this way, you are doing it from your compensating identities as a way to resist, or hide your False Core. This reinforces thoughts and breakages in your biology—and your psychology. This is the reason why people who have mastered Hatha Yoga rarely, if ever, have quiet minds, or they have a very large ego about postures they can get into. Although their health might improve, because certainly Hatha Yoga is a health practice, at the same time, the purpose of Hatha Yoga is much deeper. One of its purposes is to realign your physical body so that you can realize that it is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. The purpose of Hatha Yoga is not to "look" better and reinforce your compensating identities which reinforce your False Core. It is through Core Yoga that your biology and your BIOLOGICAL CORE meet your ESSENTIAL CORE (Volume III). This is Biological I AM THAT. YOUR IMAGE OF THE BODY IS NOT THE BODY Korzbyski said that, "The idea is not the thing it is referring to."
