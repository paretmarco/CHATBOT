Hence, the more subtle search for who we are and our complete nature took a back seat. For many years the exploration of problem states and, of course, problem resolution have been in the driver's seat. Our search became limited to diagnosis and the treatment of problems. How do we cope with and solve the dilemmas of life? In a real sense, the industrial revolution and technology could be seen as having dehumanized people, asking people to behave as The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness machines. Historically, as you trace the industrial revolution, you can see how it played a major role. For example, as Europe became more industrialized, philosophy whose focus was "Who Am I?" shifted to psychology's focus of, "How can I survive, cope and handle today's problems and conflicts?" The question, "Who Am I? What is my nature?" was abandoned and in its place came "How can I cope?" "How can I survive?" And when someone could not fit into the fast-paced industrial world, rather than asking what was wrong with the system, it became "What is wrong with me?"
