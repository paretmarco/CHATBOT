Three things revealed themselvesâ€”I) she had her concepts connected to her spine and they were activated by her sitting up straight (in a meditation posture); 2), her concepts and trauma were attached around, and re-activated by, the control of her breathing and thinking (i.e., slowing her breath and stopping her thoughts); and 3) to defend herself against "feeling" the trauma she had developed an image of herself as a little girl standing in the sunlight and hanging-up clothes which relaxed her yielding safety and comfort. If we examine this, we can easily see that if she got involved with a "spiritual" system which said you needed to sit up straight, spine erect, or watch or control your breathing or thoughts, it would only re-enforce her concepts and the trauma itself because it would ask her to unknowingly re-enforce the biological component (body position) which held the system together. If she went to a therapist who stressed a "symbol of safety" (like an Ericksonian hypnotherapist), this might make her "feel" more comfortable and relaxed.
