One of the methods Donato used to produce fascination was the following manner: He would cause the subject to lean on his hands, thus fatiguing the muscles. The excitement produced by the concentrated gaze also assisted in weakening the nervous resistance. At last the operator would suddenly call out: “Look at me!” The subject would look up and gaze steadily into the operator’s eyes, who would stare steadily back with round, glaring eyes, and subdue him. When working with the hypnotic subject, Morselli tells us, he make him act “like a dramatic artist who intends to represent different parts in a comedy or tragedy". Hypnosis produces “dramas, comedies and farces, without number and without end, that can multiply according to the pleasurable fantasy of the one conducting the experiment and of those undergoing it3 plays whose termination must always feel like a curtain falling on a scene that "chills the dramatic sympathy of o spectator". And here Donato operates on healthy individuals whom he doesn't know.
