What I am saying here needs to be emphasized since for many this is more than just controversialâ€”it is BLASPHEMOUS. Many therapists believe that trance-ference is beneficial and that by being the "good enough parent," they can guide the client through their developmental phases. Thus, they encourage trance- ference as part of the healing process. Quantum Psychology believes that this merely psychologizing and only justifies and serves the un- resolved counter- trance-ference issues in the world of psychology. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Encouraging, allowing or supporting trance-ference only begets more dependency and trance-ference. THE QUANTUM APPROACH TO TRANCE-FERENCE BUST THE TRANCE-FERENCE FIRST I would like to share my own experience of the most important intervention that I, as a student, ever experienced. I had lived in India about two years,,and without realizing it, I had trance-ference issues with my Indian teachers/gurus. In other words, if I had a question like, "What should I do?" "Where should I live?" "Should I get married?" many gurus with counter-trance-ference issues would play the super-spiritualized, all-knowing parent and give me answers.
