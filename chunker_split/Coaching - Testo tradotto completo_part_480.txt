The “projection into the future” A trader does project things into the future whenever he constructs, for his own benefit, a fantasy by which he manages to metabolize a loss by accepting it. In the field of traditional hypnosis, temporal progression (or temporal pseudo-orientation) might be regarded as a variant of the “hypnotic dream”. It is further linked to entertaining a certain belief: “It is a foregone conclusion that I will earn well”, as well as: “It is actually easy to earn, all one has to do is to hang in there firmly”. In this temporal progression, the trader’s mind discerns an imaginary future, on the basis of which he interprets the present. The person who is immersed in a continuous "temporal progression" speaks by making use of the future tense: "The market shall bring about”, “I shall be", etc.
