This operation is capable of encompassing not only the elimination of the activities which have become useless because they are automatic and accordingly deprived of meaning, be it pleasant or unpleasant, but also the moral eradication of passions, resentful grudges, useless memories, which represent a real cumbersome load we drag along for several years, in the absence, that is, of a deliberate effort to rid ourselves thereof 19. Each one of us must pose the following question to his self: Why am I still retaining these emotions? Do I not want to let go of them? Let us reiterate the point. When, by virtue of the automatism of mental images or due to the concatenation of events, a certain problem, a certain desire to act, arises in us, the first step we should take is to quickly analyze whether the problem ought to be unavoidably solved (in which event one resorts to pre-ideation), or whether, conversely, it merely consists in an arbitrary problem or fact, in which case the pros and cons of giving effect to it will have to be weighed up.
