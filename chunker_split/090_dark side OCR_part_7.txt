The adult of witnessing self is the one who created the trances in the first place. The witnessing self is the I of I or the you of you. When we grasp that we are the true source of our own frozen life, an empowering enlightenment takes place and adult responsi- bility follows. Wolinsky's work thus serves the important task of safeguard- ing the regressive tendencies inherent in inner child work. For whether we intend to are not, there is an ever present temptation to "objectify" the inner child so that the various states of childhood being are given a kind of functional autonomy. Once this happens, the "inner child" is idealized and becomes an end in itself. With Wolinsky's work, there can be no confusion on this point. The inner child is not all precious and wonderful. By grasping the ways we continue to use the frozen and outdated trances of survival, we deprive ourselves of some essential areas of human experience. These areas include behaviors like curiosity, question- ing, resiliency, exuberance, and spontaneity. Wolinsky calls this limiting function the "dark side of the inner child" . We need our feelings of curiosity, spontaneity, and exuberance.
