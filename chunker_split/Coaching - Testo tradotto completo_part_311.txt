Exercise 51 – Abolishing the first person singular When you identify your own actions, you should abolish the first person singular “I”. One method for achieving that is to emulate Julius Caesar, who made use of the third person singular when referring to his own self. In this manner, you might be able to “see yourselves acting”, instead of merely “acting”. An alternative way, which might actually complement the preceding one, is to resort to using the infinitive verb “to act”, “to do”, rather than the formulas “I am acting”, “I do”. You are going to find that this simple linguistic method changes your perception of reality. Instantaneous mono-ideation It appears to be clear, based on what has been stated up to now, that in our view the best guarantee of success is provided, in the first place, by the clarity and comprehensiveness of our predeterminations, and, secondly, by the emotional power by which we might be able to re-vivify them, thereby making their practical implementation — so to speak — an inevitably pre-destined occurrence.
