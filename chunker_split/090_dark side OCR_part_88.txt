Years later at work or in relationships, the inner child within the adult will 54 â€¢:* The Dark Side of the inner Child automatically play the game and go into a disconnection-from-self trance. I once had a man come into a session who had a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Harvard. He complained of impotence, and as I began working with him, he experienced his head disconnected and floating above his body. As he began to reconnect his head to his body, his repressed sexual feelings toward his mother came up. Here his sexuality was so fused with his mother that he felt no sensation in the head of his penis, and the sensations were in his head (Ph.D. Chemist from Harvard). Reconnecting his head to his body somehow forced the sensations of sexuality for his mother to emerge. Developmentally, disconnection helps a child survive. Dis- connection means being over there, rather than here. Disconnection occurs when external reality is threatening. The child handled this and survived by taking off, checking out, or disconnecting. A child of an alcoholic or abusive family might check out to avoid the painful present. Often in cases of incest, a person might check out to avoid contact.
