Also when visibility is poor, the eye tends to relax and focus on its best distance, technically known as "empty field" or "dark focus". This distance is usually just under one meter (one yard), but varies considerably among people. The tendency is aggravated by objects close to the eye, drawing focus closer. Since resting accommodation is approximately one metre objects the operator, in the case he will move himself farther he will be also out of focus. We should note that the Mandelbaum Effect is not refractive error in the usual sense. It is instead something happening inside the brain: it is not a structural characteristic of the eyes, but the Effect arises from normal variations of perception in the brain. When there is spatial disorientation, it is posited some people are severely affected by the effect, some mildly, and some not at all. Curiosity: The effect is well known in aviation where dirty glass can aggravate the effect, potentially causing a pilot or driver to miss seeing an obstacle or hazard, and therefore it is a strong safety argument for keeping windows clean.
