Yet another illustrating example is that of an individual who is unable to ever commit himself to a relationship, as he incessantly formulates mental projections, spanning many years, of a possible life together with any person he meets. We might think of an additional scenario, one in which an error in respect of a time horizon might even make us feel devoid of any control over the situation, whereas, by starting from small steps, we might possibly be able to dominate it. This is for instance the case of a person who lets his self be swayed by panic. Conversely, too short a horizon might screen us from noticing the consequences of what we are busy doing. If we are capable of selecting the appropriate time sequence, if we, that is, can manage to detach ourselves from too static a “self”, we are then enabled to function better and to better channel our vital energy towards an intended objective. The framing time horizon is normally unconscious. How can we then succeed in expanding the vision?
