Pain and pleasure, in fact, are two such narrow peaks that one can only be in a state of balance atop them for no more than a flashing moment 61; by contrast, happiness and unhappiness represent two states. Normally, pleasure is experienced by many people only within the “change in state” which is the consequence of a stimulus. It is however a physiological law that repeated equal stimuli will turn the recipient organism insensitive. Accordingly, in order for pleasure to endure, what we need is either for the stimulus to be constantly stronger, or for it to be rare enough to enable the organism to welcome it as if it were a novelty. In order for one to keep on tasting pleasure, it is therefore necessary that he should have a certain mental attitude, which ensures that gratifications are not swallowed by our mind as a result of such mind viewing them as usual fare.
