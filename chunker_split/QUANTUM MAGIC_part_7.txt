We are one and the same as the structures that underlie the matter and energy that we manifest as; and that structure is continuous, interconnected, and non local in nature. Whatever the underlying structure behind the interconnected wave pattern described by quantum mechanics (if any), we are that. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND CONSCIOUSNESS Getting back to established scientific theory, normal waking consciousness occurs when the nerve cell firing rate (synaptic switching rate) is high enough to spread out the waves associated with electrons to fill the gaps between nerve cells (synaptic clefts) with waves of probability of similar amplitude. This is described mathematically by the quantum mechanical mechanism of tunneling. These waves are interconnected throughout regions of the brain through resonances, resulting in a large, complex, unified, quantum mechanically defined resonance matrix filling a region in the brain. The waves are interconnected with each other and with information storage and sensory input mechanisms within these regions of the brain. The nerve cell firing rate (v') at which this occurs has been modeled mathematically by Evan Harris Walker (at the U.S. Army Ballistics Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground) and corresponds to the threshold between waking and sleeping consciousness in people and animals.
