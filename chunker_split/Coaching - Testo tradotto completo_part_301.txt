The multiplication of the idea by means of the light represents a quantum technique having a close connection with the techniques utilized for the sake of making ourselves magnetic, which techniques are going to be set out in the next chapter. By resorting to such techniques, practical implementation of the idea is multiplied, and we come to appropriate it more as part of our usual assets. Verbalize your presentification. Look now at the light, and repeat such verbalization as you do so. Close your eyes. Follow the luminous trace with your sight. When time comes to reopen your eyes, you will realize how your own idea has further permeated the inner core of your being, how it has turned into something which now pervades you. Substitution of personality It is also possible to combine presentification with personality substitution, and go even as far as anticipating an action as one which is carried out by some other people. Our self, in fact, what we term “our personality”, is in actual truth a blend devoid of any permanent value, and one which changes by its self every single moment. We are able a fortiori to resolve on choosing for ourselves the personality we want to have.
