By noticing the stage or phase, the experiencERexperience or knowER-known are in, they disappear. Ramana Maharishi used to say it was important to trace the source of the "T' thought. Four stages: 1) arising; 2) maintaining; 3) ending; 4) "Quanturn-fying." Step I Step II Step HI Step IV Step V Notice an experience or known. Notice the experiencER or knowER. Notice the stage the dyad is in and name the phase. Notice what occurs when "you" say to "yourself," "What knowER is knowing that?"
