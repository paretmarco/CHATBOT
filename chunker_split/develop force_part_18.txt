We are now going to pay notice to how we are capable of coming across these very same elements in different civilizations. According to the ancient Egyptians, for instance, the eye of Horus might be both the right eye and the left eye. Traditionally, the right eye is linked to the sun, while the left one is connected to the moon 16. In the East, Shiva is often depicted with three eyes: Two such eyes, which correspond to the sun and the moon, are directed towards the outside world, towards the things, which accordingly seem to exist in a state of “duality”. There is yet a third eye, centrally located, a unifying eye which faces a different dimension, one of self-consciousnes and self-intuition, which is symbolized by a spiral in the drawing set out here under. From an anatomical point of view, we can notice how in man the location of the right eye and the left eye corresponds to the two hemispheres of the brain, and are often related to rational value (linked to the masculine principle) and emotional value (which is more feminine). The eye in the middle or third eye, therefore, is neither masculine nor feminine. At a physiological level, this point corresponds to the epiphysis, which is where the pineal gland regulating man’s day / night cycle, and which secretes melatonin, is situated. Such pineal gland has a relation with intuition.
