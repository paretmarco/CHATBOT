Now you must further extend your consciousness to your speech. Listen to yourselves talking. Be aware of the fact you are talking. This particular exercise has a visible effect even on the people around you. If you speak while you LISTEN TO YOURSELVES SPEAKING, your voice will come out clearer and neater. These exercises which are centred on direct sensory perception will gift you greater awareness of your body, and will gradually free you from a whole array of psychosomatic reactions. Although the body is the foundation of physical actions, many people confuse the body’s physiological reactions with its emotional responses. In some instances, indeed, some of these persons go as far as turning other people into the victims of such physiological reactions. For instance, a person suffering from stomach ache becomes irritated with other individuals. We must of necessity distinguish physiological reactions from mental responses, as otherwise the former would turn into hooks which will no longer allow us to live serenely. Having consciousness of the side which is responsible for bodily reactions is further useful as a tool to get rid of one’s excessive mental dialogues.
