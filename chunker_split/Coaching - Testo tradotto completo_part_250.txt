The arenas of feelings and interpersonal relationships Our sentimental activity leads us into the depths of individuality, into those recesses where we are truly ourselves, ignored by the rest, inaccessible to anybody else inside our tight bag which separates us from the Universe. What avails in this arena, more than a program of action, is to find an “ideal frame”. What is it that we want? Which type of relationship is the one we desire? Each one of us gives tangible expression to his own sentimental and moral self within a specific conception of the world. At the same time, if he is not watchful over himself, he runs the risk of manifesting that self through acts which are often totally antithetical to what he outwardly proclaims. It is necessary to remember that, when we face other than ourselves, we essentially fade in accordance with how we actually deal with them, and that neither this nor that exteriorized declaration will be of any value unless it is reflected in our acts. Every one of us, on the other hand, represents a freely choosing individuality, as such having an unrestricted capacity to imagine what would be the best for itself.
