The reason behind my visit is, first of all, to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance ... Might you be so kind as to allow me five minutes now, or do you actually prefer to receive a phone call from me during which we might arrange an appointment?» The answer is going to be as follows: «Please tell me ... what is it all about?». Set yourself in the mental state of one who has already arranged the appointment.

You will thereby gain time without increasing your working hours at all, simply by programming matters in a rational and intelligent way. 2.
