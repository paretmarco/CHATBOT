Examples of such verbal expressions would be, ‘Are there any past events which justify this behaviour?’. Even if the subject is unable to remember them, his unconscious will be reignited, and at that moment he will also meet your look. By fixing our look on him, we become at such stage an integral part of the process [46], and we, too, are included among the resources. We might then proceed to act in one of several manners: * We might stare at him and lead him, through the use of words, to extend his visual field by noticing other elements in the picture which have an intrinsic ability to alter his automatic reaction. We would then say to him, ‘Extend your look, can’t you see around elements that might instead lend you tranquillity or stability?’. Note: This type of technique might even be practiced independently, on one’s own. We might bring back to mind, as a form of re-enactment, a particular scene which instils fear in us, and we then extend our look widely.
