"Mirroring" in modern hypnosis is often used to mean "bringing verbally unconscious reactions to the attention of the subject ". Somebody calls it "verbally ratifying the trance". In fascination you do not do it. Animals do not say themselves what they are doing. Verbalizing what is happening would risk breaking the "animal state" and plunging to a "normal psychological verbal hypnosis" where reactions could appear sometimes enhanced, but also in a more conscious way. On the other hand, in fascination you want the subject to have the possibility to really answer in a totally unconscious way and to get the change that he deeply wants to achieve, with the least conscious interference. Even here we can observe that the ancient, from which we have retrieved this tradition, used the same phrasing I have yet described. They also obtained results even stronger than the moderns in the fields of telepathy and distance healing. Mind to mind communication does not rely on words. Even animals can perceive it as many researches have tried to show. Even what we call "magnetic fascination therapy" does not rely on words. It couples the power of fascination with "magnetism" for achieving best effects.
