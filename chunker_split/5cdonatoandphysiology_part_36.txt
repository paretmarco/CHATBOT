It was first scientifically codified by Mandelbaum in 1960 in relation to something observed during pilot flights. The use of the hand in fascination can be explained with factors related to the Mandelbaum effect, i.e. the tendency of the eye to approach "resting" accommodation. The resting point of accommodation is also called the "dark focus" as it is the distance where the eyes accommodate as they look in the dark. We note that there are disciplines, as the "dzogchen", that teach "sky gazing". Sky gazing will result in the eyes accommodating to the space of nothing and in this space we can experience non duality. Also when visibility is poor, the eye tends to relax and focus on its best distance, technically known as "empty field" or "dark focus". This distance is usually just under one meter (one yard), but varies considerably among people. The tendency is aggravated by objects close to the eye, drawing focus closer. Since resting accommodation is approximately one meter objects the operator, in the case he will move himself farther he will be also out of focus. We should note that the Mandelbaum Effect is not refractive error in the usual sense.
