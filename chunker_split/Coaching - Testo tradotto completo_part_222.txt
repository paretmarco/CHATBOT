The problem is that the grand idea is but a natural by-product of our mind, and can only materialize after this mind has put some small ideas into practice and has successfully accomplished them. It is as if the Universe was going to give us more, as if it was going to progressively strengthen our energy the more we venture inside it. Besides, if we were not already accustomed to “doing”, we would not be able to translate the “grand idea” into practice even if it were to face us directly, inasmuch as the “muscle of active doing” would be atrophied. When, conversely, the person who follows the method of this book formulates a “grand idea”, he is able to recognize it for what it is and to give practical effect to it.

What would then be the purpose of dreaming of an itinerary which might actually turn out to be different?
