Having a supine attitude to social dictates, which is a trait that begins as a mere outward approach and eventually turns into a way of thinking, is one of the first causes of what we mentioned. Man, who might be otherwise solely dependent on the natural elements, begins to fill up his existence, to encage himself in a social mechanism which he cannot escape from other than by breaching certain conventions that are deemed indispensable to the reputation of his entire caste. Thereafter, he bonds himself to an enslaving career which is determined by other people, and which tosses him this way or that way, while he remains at the mercy of someone else’s capricious whims. He subsequently attempts to confer on himself a “social position”, the preservation of which wears him out. Not happy with all of that, he then gives himself to some political party. Whichever side he turns to, modern man is encircled by a barbed wire fence he cannot trespass with impunity, without, that is, exposing his self to the risk of death. He lacks the freedom either to disengage or contradict himself.
