By secluding ourselves to our best capacity, we might be able to focus our undivided thought on the obstacles we are called upon to surmount, on the different points concerning which we neatly perceive the route leading us to their successful implementation. In this manner, we would be creating an “accumulation of thought”. Let us also think of possible solutions, without however straining ourselves excessively in the process. We should in any event think that we are eventually going to find a way out of those problems. We ought to say to our own selves: “This is what I like to see materializing irrespective of any thing”. The time required for the accumulation of thought which is suitable to activate the answer ranges from ten to fifteen minutes. If more than just one problem exists, you should classify them, first and foremost in order of urgency, and then direct your attention to each one of them separately.
