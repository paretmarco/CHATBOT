Rather there are numerous inner children, each with a different perception, a different awareness, a different world view, etc. (See Illustration #1, page 4). This is, therefore, an inner child with a dark side; rather than being just precious, it has a dysfunctional shadow side. One of the purposes of this book is to get the reader in touch with that frozen, inner-child memory that keeps creating problems by filtering real- ity through outmoded, limited, and distorted lenses. 4 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child Not one inner child or SchemaMany inner children or Schema Illustration #1 This illustration shows a picture of not one, but many inner children. Conventional professional therapy would try to change the inner child's view, to re-frame it, "complete" its unfinished busi- ness, or "champion" it. In psychotherapy, a client might present a frozen memory-like picture in his or her mind of a parent doing something abusive to him/her. The therapist might then ask the client to "miniaturize" him/herself and "go into" the picture to re- experience the trauma and all its attendant pain and suffering.
