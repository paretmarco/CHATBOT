Our specific importance is limited to the portion of space occupied by our body in the Universe, and is never too much of a thing, whichever way we turn it to 39. It is therefore absurd to pretend that we also occupy a place in somebody elseâ€™s soul, or demand gratitude, affection, or what is even worse, recollection and loyalty after our death, when our body will have returned to the nothingness it had just now exited for a short while only. True Man advances by Retreating / He is always present by Staying outside / By not turning himself into the centre he attains perfection (Tao Te king) We ought to be objective with our own selves and our external circumstances as they factually exist in time and space, so as for us to perceive our minimal significance while at the same time realizing that precisely due to that fact we are able to do a lot. The state of permanent attention which is predominantly focused on our own selves and circumstances does in fact engender a pronounced neglect of external things, a neglect which accrues to our detriment. The accessing key to true success is to be found instead in being attentive to what lies outside us.
