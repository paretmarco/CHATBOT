My reply is always the same; 1) a willingness to look at and confront whatever stands in the way of this unity consciousness, 2) a willingness to let go of belief structures no matter how "comfort- able", and 3) awareness, which I have called the solvent to the glue of trance states, the trance-ending ingredient. This is the attitude, a warrior's attitude, of being called to be aware, to confront and let go of concepts, many of which have never been looked at as concepts, but assumed to be truths. To illustrate this let me narrate a story of what happened to me in India in about 1979. I was visiting my teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj. He asked me, "Do you know youiself?" I replied, "I feel a lot of love and bliss, and I can even see energy." He snarled back, "I'm not interested in knowing if you are satisfied or pacified with your spiritual life, do you know yourself?" I said, "no." He said, "Then shut your mouth." Two years later I appreciated what he was so dramatically saying.
