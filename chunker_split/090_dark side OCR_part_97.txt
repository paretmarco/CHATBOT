Actually, the overwhelming, compulsive attraction is the inner child's attraction to another' s inner child. Very often, inner-child to inner-child connections are so strong that the child within the adult adapts a spiritual philosophy like, "This was meant to be," or "We are soul mates." Although this falls under the trance of spiritualization, dis-connection and other trances overlap and work in tandem. As with all trances, fusion is created by a series of family interactions. For example, an individual may be an "adult child of an alcoholic" and had to take care of parents or siblings. They experienced not being able to let go, daydream, fantasize, or even play. Fear of possible catastrophic outcomes in the environment cause the child to be overly responsible (for the non-functioning parent). Thus, a hyper-vigilance trance. I had a woman whose father was alcoholic and she always took care of him. Her philosophy was, "I'll take care of him, so that he can take care of me." She had to over-identify and watch every move Dad made so that she could survive.
