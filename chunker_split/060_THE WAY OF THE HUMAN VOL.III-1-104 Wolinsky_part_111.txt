10s * Mantras are used in an attempt to change this "you" to another vibrational pattern at a higher frequency used to change sound patterns in the Electro-magnetic mechanism. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism uses mantras, yantras, and tantras as an attempt to change the "you" to another vibrational pattern, a higher frequency used to change the patterns of perception of the Electro-magnetics The vibration of sound makes me believe I AM. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism creates a unique sound like a snowflake and, therefore, a unique nervous system, and I AM is just based on its different locations in space-time. * Electro-magnetic mechanism gives the perception that we are all the sameâ€”when each sound vibration makes us different only the same through sound which is a by-product of light which is a by-product of the NOTHING. ________________ * The sense of I AM is frozen light. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism uses light to create the illusion of a seeER separate from the seen. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism makes you believe there is a you made of light. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism makes "me" believe in enlightenment. * When the light disperses there is no-me.
