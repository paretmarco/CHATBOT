Naturally, personal power, too, expands, as that course leads man to the only point where the springhead of such power is situated, namely, his own self. Being centralized, being present to ourselves, also leads one to understand the relativity of every thing and every fact. We must make the following saying by the Arab sage part of our existential lexicon: — Have you conquered the earthly dominium? Do not rejoice about that, as it is nothing. Have you lost the worldly dominium? Do not grieve, as it is nothing. Everything in the world passes away and is nothing. — This concept must be used to benefit to us, not in order to give up acting, but rather in order to act more freely, and to endure on firmer grounds fortune’s wrongs and caprices. Whoever wants to look back and remember his anxieties, or the worries he experienced as a result of some fact on which his destiny in life seemed at that time to depend, will realize that his life has almost always unfolded itself independently of the outcome of that fact. He will realize therefore that being so concerned with it was undeserving of the effort.
