This desire to model another, to look for a model, or to want to be a model, is an age-regressed reenactment of that early childhood state. Think about who's good at modeling behaviors, matching words and positions to gain rapport, and who is good at fusing with a person. Children do that all the time with their parents. But therapies and spiritual groups often encourage and support this trance-ference and the creation of a brand new shiny identity. This attracts, seduces and is easy for the client or trainee because it reinforces the unprocessed age-regression, or better said, it reinforces a false grandiose self. For example, in India I saw many people beginning to walk like, talk like, and have the same mannerisms as their gurus. These early age-regressions or spiritualizations are misunderstood as a person being spiritual. I often meet therapists who look, act, and think that they are their false selves by acting out of an unconditionally positive regard identity. Very often they have so integrated this false self therapist's identity, that they have placed it on top of a neurotic self.
