Then, all of sudden your mind thinks," I like the way they look," or "I like how they are," or "I like the way he/she sleeps next 'Many of these exercises are in Quantum Consciousness and Hearts of Fire. if you do not need a reviewâ€”skip them. The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness to me," etc. Two or three days later, you wake up and look at your lover and a thought goes by, "Oh, no, what am I doing with her/ him?" The next thing you find yourself thinking, "I really would like to go out with somebody else," or "Maybe I should get a divorce," or "What a mistake, I am wasting my time." An even more common experience is to wake up in the morning feeling very good; a thought goes by your awareness called "I feel good" and you identify with that thought. Your mind will then start coming up with reasons why you feel good: "I feel good because I got a lot of sleep." "I feel good because I didn't sleep very much."
