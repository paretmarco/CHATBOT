For example, if a personality is dominated by the compulsions of the type to which it belongs, we refer to “false personality” or “destructive self”. The enneagram is a new answer to the research of understanding ourselves and others, communication, and relationships between human beings. “He that has made a door and a lock has also made a key” (Chabreuil) Hypnosis in NLP is a developed ability to communicate which allows us to establish excellent relations with others, and grow towards autonomy, freedom and the appreciation of life in all of its glory. We can control our brain together with its functioning in its relationship with ourselves and we can make it carry out the instructions we give it. For example, if we speak angrily, the brain selects anger and arranges an adequate state of mind to the thoughts activated. On the other hand, if we express ourselves with enthusiasm, the brain will process this type of response and produces a happy state of mind. “Our brain is a learning machine and we are its programmers!!!!! !” Passing from one state of mind to another is an automatic ability. This is demonstrable when we watch two lovers together: both of them depend on smiles and words of love in order to feel being in hell or heaven.
