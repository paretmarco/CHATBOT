The False Core Driver-False Self Compensator cannot exist without the verbal I AM, because then whose False core Driver-False Self Compensator would it be? and the verbal I AM cannot exist without the NON-VERBAL I AM. For many "psycho-spiritual" traditions this is the end point. For Nisargadatta Maharaj, this was a beginning point(er), which, when it falls away, takes you beyond consciousness itself. He believed that once the I AM is or becomes stabilized, then the I AM itself can fall away.' In 1976 a French psychiatrist asked Nisargadatta Maharaj a long-winded question about births-deaths, credits-debits, etc. Nisargadatta Maharaj replied, "Who told you that you exist? He then waited a few minutes for a response. When there was none, he said, Your mind tells you that you exist, consciousness tells you that you exist and you believe it. "If you understand just this, it is enough." QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The I AM, as Nisargadatta Maharaj says, is the seed of "your consciousness." No I AM, no consciousness.
