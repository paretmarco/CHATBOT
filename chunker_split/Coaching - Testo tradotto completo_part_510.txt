In order to develop such intuitive acumen, we need to understand that our mind has two ways in which it functions: 1. A linear way 2. A second mode of functioning, which might be called "intuitive", or alternatively "quantistic". If we succeed in making the mind work in accordance with the said second mode, we might then be able to naturally reproduce the mental mechanism which governs superior achievers. Opening oneself up to intuition A prerequisite to financial intuition manifesting is a state of mental opening; it is in fact important that we should surmount the negative emotions, as they would otherwise pile upon our inner sensations, thereby screening the latter from our view. It is important that we should be “larger” than problems and situations. What matters is never the dimension of the problem. What matters is your own mental dimension. If you perceive a problem as huge is only because you are small. Or as it is also put: “If every thing seems to you to be blue, you should change your pair of glasses”115. It is only at such point that we might open ourselves up to something more, to what represents a plus.
