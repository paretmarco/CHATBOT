The true way of acting efficiently, however, is regaled with one quality: It happens effortlessly. It is the consciousness of the action which gives birth to the efficient action, rather than the quantity of energy that is spent in the process. Since, moreover, the body executes what the mind truly wills, one method which is of benefit to the aim of facilitating the implementation of the plan as a whole is thus presentification, being a superior form of concentration, and one which is closely linked to self-hypnosis, of which it represents its preparatory stage. Presentification might in turn be “multiplied” as far as its effects are concerned, and made more extensively “ours” through the use of the “technique of light”. Attaining control over one’s own personality We must be the masters in charge of our personality if we want to act efficiently. Many people surrender control of the steering wheel to their egotistic selves, for them to be piloted by such external selves, whereas in fact we can take control over what we are and turn ourselves into the persons we are eager to become.
