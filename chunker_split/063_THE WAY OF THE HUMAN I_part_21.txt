This is The Way of the Human, to understand and allow all dimensions to function, without resistance, the way they were meant to function. This can be called the development of a FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS. FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS can be defined as the ability to place awareness on any single dimension, all dimensions simultaneously, or no dimensions, until awareness itself disappears in the VOID rather than having awareness habitually fixated and placed on only one or two dimensions. 5 The Way of the Human 0 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Nisargadatta Maharaj once asked a man, "Why are you coming here to see me?" "Because the guru takes away the negative and gives us our true nature," he said. Maharaj replied, "There is nothing that anyone can take away from you or give to you which you are not already since there is only THAT ONE CONSCIOUSNESS." All this considered, I am proposing that as humans we have an animal nature, a thinking nature, an emotional nature which contains feelings, and an ESSENCE with its essential qualities, etc. Awareness "unfortunately" seems to get fixated in one or more dimension.
