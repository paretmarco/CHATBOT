This is another one of the key rules, since every thing which is perfectly done or verbally expressed is an instance of acting which is free from any wastage, trimmed down therefore to the maximum possible simplicity, and which will be in need of no subsequent repetition. Understanding our direction Daily activity, which is an infinitesimal part of our life, might be compared to the activity carried out within a single minute when it is weighed up with the activity of a full day. What we mean to say is that (exactly as in the case of a single minute’s activity), its significance is not disclosed by examining on its own the entire day, but is rather grasped once we relate it to the activity which preceded it and to the goal we ultimately intend to accomplish. In other terms, we cannot develop a clear conceptual vision of a day’s task unless, at the same time, we have a distinct idea in our mind of what we want to attain in our life. We must nevertheless take care of refraining from thinking on the strength of conditioning and advices which reach us from the outside.
