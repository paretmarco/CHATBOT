For years I looked at the corning and going of "my" mind looking for the answer. Even though my eyes were closed, I was looking forward or outside at the content of my consciousness (i.e., "I love myself," "I'm good," "I'm bad," etc.). Real looking or real going within is turning your attention around and noticing there is no you, that there is NOTHING there. This has been eluded to by Nisargadatta Maharaj when he would answer students by saying, "Find out who wants to know." In Chapter XII of the Bhagavad Gita, it says, "To know the knower." To turn your attention around so that you realize the knower of the body and the mind are the same; and when the knower is actually looked for, the knower-known disappears and is discovered to be non-existent. This is what is meant by looking "within," looking for the "looker." This leads to Quantumfying (the disappearance of the appearance of (fill in the blank)). I was once sitting with Nisargadatta Maharaj and having memories of what I thought were "past lives."
