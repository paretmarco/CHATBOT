This concept might denote “doing things at the right moment”, as well as “being synchronized with reality”, or “being aligned with the now”. The ancient Greeks used to say that it was the time in which the god would manifest. This god, as we interpret it, might be deemed to represent potentiality and opportunity. They are in fact the dual set of coincidences which open up novel possibilities. Kairòs is the time in which we can gain access to our potential. It is the time in which chances and opportunities originate, and in which synchronicities occur. It is by paying attention to the now that possibilities arise and fall into our view, and that we are able to discover genial opportunities! Recognize the right moment! (???????? ? ?????) (Pittaco of Mytilene) Characteristic features of man’s two times We have, therefore, two different times in man: One of them is programmed and logical time, a time of becoming which we might call by the Greek term chronos.
