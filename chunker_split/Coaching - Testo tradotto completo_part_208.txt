There is no idea which is valid in itself. An idea is always an interdependent reality: In order to confer on it its due importance, it is necessary to pigeonhole it within the general context of our activity. Practical ideation has the additional effect of creating interest in work or in some form of pleasure, as both work and pleasure would thereby prove to be more organized, logical and clear in one’s mind, and would also be better orientated towards the goal we intend reaching. Accordingly, one could define ideation as follows: “The elucidation of the idea”, that is, the “art of obtaining through reflection some good advance knowledge of what one wants to do”. It thus enables the elimination of extraneous, dispersive and parasitical ideas. Predicting alternative possibilities Let us premeditate well. Man does not err due to a lack of will as much as he does as a result of mistaken or incomplete judgments. An inadequate judgment is echoed by an erroneous or defective action.
