Though this is something which is present in every person, we might only unravel it and lay it bare by establishing a connection with our own selves. It is indeed possible to assert that the one who has lived happily is he who has been able to work all his life on the accomplishment of his specific ideal, without suffering either material or moral lapses along the way. Discovering our own ideals by establishing connection with our own self Without seeking to delve into the moral sphere, being a sphere where we do not wish to set foot in the least, we can notice that exercising a higher human faculty, namely, will, is fundamentally nothing other than the ability to set limits on one’s own action and coordinate one’s acts towards it. WILL = SETTING AIMS WHICH ARE COORDINATED WITH ONE’S OWN ACTION Disciplining one’s will carries the meaning of giving rise to new, well arranged masses of mental representations, being systems of ideational functions capable of turning into autonomous centres of interest and activity.
