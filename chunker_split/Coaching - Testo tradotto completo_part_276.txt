In the simplified version, you will limit yourselves to writing down the things which need to be done in accordance with their required order of execution, and you will thus tick them off one by one as you go on finalizing them. As for the comprehensive version, a double page will be consecrated to each day. The left part of the double page is divided into two distinct sections. In the first part, you will note down all the operations which should be embarked upon, based on what will be highlighted by the plan for the next day, the formulation of which we have just explained to you. The operations which need to be repeated periodically or the predetermined long-term operations (holidays, trips, greetings to be sent, etc) might be noted down in advance, taking care to link each one of them to its own scheduled day. The operations might possibly have to be noted down in accordance with the sequential order in which they should be carried out. It is important to plan in our mind the order to follow in executing the different operations.
