And it is certainly true that many abused people have found solace in meditation because the disidentification that is the goal of many Eastern approaches seems so similar to the patterns of dissociation underlying their own emotional lives. The schizoid's adaptation to an insufficiently nourishing, indeed punitive, environment is to internally migrate. The false, compensatory self of the schizoid person is characterized by distance rather than by grounded, accessible living. (Johnson, 1987, p. 19) In Quantum Psychology, the schizoid must do lots of body work, such as Rolfing and Feldenkrais, coupled with an ongoing practice of yoga. This will enable them to feel their body first, before moving onto dismantling identities. In fact, in Quantum Psychology workshops, I always suggest that people get ongoing body work, as a way to integrate the Quantum work into a daily walking-around, integrative experience. ________________ THE DESIRE FOR UNION It is the resistance to the natural biological merger-separation process, particularly separation and individuation that causes the spiritualized trance of trying to return to unconscious union, often with the mother later spiritualized as God or a relationship (soulmate).
