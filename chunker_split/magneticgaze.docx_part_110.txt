Technical characteristics: It is often as if a small filter (time regression-like) were to drop down before the eyes of a person, who, as a result thereof, is thus prevented from accurately focusing upon the scene. Even the short-sighted attitude of the one affected by myopia might be related to the concept of negative hallucinations, as do some phenomena of astigmatism. Treatment: A modus operandi that might be resorted to in this context consists in suggesting variations to the type of mist surrounding the person. Possibly divide that mist into quadrants. All of this should take place as the patient is urged not to drop his look. It has the effect of changing the structure of the phenomenon which the patient is suffering, and of altering the entrenched state of trance. Passages the treatment should go through: 1 – Encouraging the negative hallucination to reach its maximum potential (while it is in a state of entrenchment) 2 – Causing it to turn even stronger 3 – Modifying the structure thereof 4 – Suggesting positive hallucinations 5 – Expanding it further, in order to encompass even things which were either not perceived (because they lay beyond the original visual field) or whose contours were vaguely indecisive 5.
