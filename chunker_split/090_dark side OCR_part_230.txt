In that way the inner child is compulsively drawn to a guru who claims to know the truth and will, since she is special, impart this secret to her. In my circumstance, it was the truth of my incest that set me free from the trance of spiritualizing. In my case I went to gurus to help me find the secret that was hidden from me, and which the inner child had hidden from me. I had transferred my parents on the guru, who I imagined knew the "secret" The guru exhibits counter-trance- ference. He represents the other side of the identity, pretending either he knows the secret of freedom, or claims he is free and, therefore, can unlock the hidden secret within you. Often the guru suggests methods or ways to unlock these secrets of the universe. Here the guru believes he has the way, and the child within the adult trance-fers his parents onto the guru, in hope of finding the way out of the maze of the secret, (i.e. the incest or dysfunction.) The secret is spiritualized, being called "maya" (the illusion) in some Asian systems. The Guru did not know the secret of my incest.
