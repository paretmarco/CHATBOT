I think we have failed to take notice of the phenomenon in adult life of the wide-ranging collective search for an object (mother) that is identified with the metamorphosis of the self. In many religious faiths, for example, when the subject believes in the deity's actual potential to transform the total environment, he sustains the structure. (pp. 16-17) This is the over-spiritual seeker identity looking for another to transform you rather than taking responsibility for your own transformation. Often in guru/disciple, teacher/student or therapist/client relationships, the guru, teacher or therapist becomes the transformational mother (object). In fact, many a teacher, guru or therapist has adopted a whole philosophy or system to re-enforce this age-regression. For example, one system has made statements like, "The guru is the root of all action," or "The guru takes responsibility for your spiritual unfoldment." These are classic "red flags" of the mother being trance-ferred as a transformational object by the disciple (child) onto the guru (mother), and the guru's counter-tranceference and narcissism placed back on the disciple.
