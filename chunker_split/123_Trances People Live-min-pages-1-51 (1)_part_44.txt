For me it change the means that the therapist learns to communicate with the creative being, the "self," behind the trance; it is the self that can ceeds or fails trance and hence the symptom. The reason therapy suc pist, or to the severity or is not always due to the skill of the thera always due to the trance states tenacity of early traumas; nor is it themselves. It can be due to the being as a creative self. As I have said, it is my view that whenever a client presents a problem or symptom to me, he or she is also presenting a trance state. Symptom structures are supported by Deep Trance Phenom- enon that come in clusters and form an internal latticing of associations and responses that the person experiences as problem- atic. These clusters of trance phenomena will reveal themsel ves in an autonomous fashion to the observant therapist. I mentioned the alcoholic client who, as the session tit ifolded, spontaneously began to age regress. I requested that she maintain continued eye contact with me during the regression.
