In one situation, the memory in the form of a picture of the child relating to the parent is fused with and they become the child, transferring the parent onto the other. This is trance-ference. In the other situation, the memory in the form of a picture of the child reacting to the parent, the parent is fused with trance-ferring the child onto another. This is counter-trance-ference. This impacts us in many ways. If the fusion is with the child, she/he can get involved with "omniscient" teachers, therapists, politicians, or religious leaders since they trance-fer mom/dad onto the authority figure. In other words, just as the infant sees morn as a magical omniscient being who fulfills all their desires, so too does the adult operating out of a child identity sees a guru, teacher, or spiritual system as all knowing, all powerful and magical. For example, in India, heaven is called Vaikunta. Vaikunta is seen as a place where, whenever a desire arises, it is magically filled. Notice how in this scenario, the magical trance-ference is placed onto the hereafter.
