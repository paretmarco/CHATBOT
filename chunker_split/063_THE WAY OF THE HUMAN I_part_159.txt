I'd like you to let your eyes close very gently. Notice the way you're sitting. As thoughts arise in your consciousness, I'd like you to ask yourself, "To whom does this thought arise?" Answer, "To me." Then ask, "Who is this I?" and notice what happens. ________________ Chapter VI THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #3 Focus: When a thought arises ask, "Who told you that?" then answer, "The mind." The purpose of this practice is to cultivate the understanding that all information comes from the mind. To emphasize this, since it is the nature of the mind to always change its mind, it is apparent that one must understand that thoughts are the mind. By practicing this meditation, the identification with the "mind stuff' loosens its grip. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to say, "To go beyond the mind you must look away from the mind and its contents." This practice can be done with a partner. Each time a thought arises, ask yourself, "Who told you that?" Then answer, "The mind."
