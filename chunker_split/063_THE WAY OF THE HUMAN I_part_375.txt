It occurs when you split-off from the experience of a painful event, refusing to feel the pain or fear or humiliation. Usually, we learn to dissociate as children, when 245 e have few internal defenses to fall back upon. A child who is molested by her father cannot allow herself to fully feel the horror, so she "shuts down" part of her reaction by splitting-off from it. . . .
