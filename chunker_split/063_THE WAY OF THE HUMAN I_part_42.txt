The presuppositions, conclusions and assumptions, the stories, and lies about who you are and who you are not are taken apart so that they can be seen for what they are: misinformation. Then not only do all the old presuppositions and premises disappear but also the "you" you called yourself. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to say, "What you know about yourself came from outside of you, therefore discard it." The enquiry and questions used are the tools which provide a "way" to follow Maharaj's premise, "Question everythingâ€”do not believe anything." It should also be noted that many "Advaitists" feel that the use of any kind of "technique" presupposes an "I" which does it. Quantum Psychology appreciates this, however, knowing that ultimately both the enquirer-enquiree naturally disappear. For this reason, Quantum Psychology suggests that you not give up your boat [techniques] on the sea of existence until you know how to swim. It should also be borne in mind that Quantum Psychology is not for everybody. In fact, "I" often discourage people from taking workshops and turn people down if "I" don't think it's right for them.
