Spiritualizing + 133 imagines his parents as God. The infant believes his parents are all- good, all-powerful, all-loving and all-knowing. This is re-enforced by parents that suggest this is true. For example, a little girl has to play Dad' s game in order to survive. In order not to feel the pain of giving up oneself to survive, the observer creates the idea within the infant that Dad is a god-like figure. A possible outcome is, years later the infant within the adult is attracted to and joins a "spiritual group." This group has a philoso- phy and rules for getting God's Love (which is really Dad's and Mom's love), or rules for getting to heaven, winning grace, getting liberation, bliss, etc. It is the infant within the adult who is drawn into this Tamil-iar game of the family. Simply put, the infant within feels overwhelmingly connected and attracted to spiritual groups and philosophies that mirror her family of origin. This attraction to such groups, communities or philosophies is because they are family replicas from the past. This is the spiritualization process.
