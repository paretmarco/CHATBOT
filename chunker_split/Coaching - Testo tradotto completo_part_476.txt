focusing excessively on moments from the past. We might for instance remember with vivid intensity the gains we have made in the past, and this memory influences us despite the fact that the market is now different. 6. Temporal distortion, which leads us not to be aware of time passing by, and which prevents us from successfully demarcating our objectives. 7. Hypnotic Regression and Post-hypnotic Suggestion, namely, acting in obedience of phrases and beliefs which have been learnt during childhood, such as “do not make mistakes”. The trader suffering from it would then invent reasons that might tend to explain and justify why he is losing. 8. Sensory distortion, which is also present in several compulsive habits such as “compulsive trading”. In it, we distort attention to reality by replacing it with attention to our own excitement. 9. Amnesia, meaning that one leaves aside or wipes out elements from his past and, in the field of trading specifically, not to keep track of one's losses. That gives rise to compulsive trading, one in which the subject drives on until the total squandering of his capital.
