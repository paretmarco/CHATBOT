The developing infant re-enforces her cognitions, beliefs, and strategies in an attempt to organize her world. More simply put, when facing her dysfunctional situation, the child employs survival strategies to defend herself from the fear of annihilation. Second Level Processes The second level of development is "idealizing." The develop- ing child creates his parents as ideals, in order to avoid facing the terror of death, chaos, or annihilation. For example in a house where one or both parents are dysfunctional, the child does not have the strength to face the chaos which he views as possible death through neglect or abuse. The observer has the child go into a trance to not feel, not see, or not know what the situation is. The observer creates the child idealizing the parents and creates them as perfect. This helps the child resist the chaos of seeing them as dysfunctional and provides him with a strategy to handle his own internal chaos. If he saw his parents' dysfunction, it would be too horrifying; so ideali- zation seems like the only sane path.
