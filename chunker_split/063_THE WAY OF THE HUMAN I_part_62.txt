In psychotherapy or even spiritual work, there is a story created even further after the fact to explain how to overcome this false conclusion. 29 The Way of the Human 9 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness project essential qualities onto others as if having a relationship with another or owning this or that will "get me love." In a workshop recently, a woman told me, "Gurdjieff said that you have to grow ESSENCE." I think what he meant was, You have to grow the awareness of ESSENCE. And this requires freeing up the awareness you have fixated on your False Core-False Self. Simply put, we deny and resist our ESSENCE because it is fused with the shock of the Realization of Separation and thus we blame and want to get rid of that (mislabeled) emptiness, too. Once we realize that we are resisting only our ESSENCE, everything shifts and the fixation on the False Core-False Self begins to soften. This is a major awakening. If the trance of the False Core-False Self does not end, you will always unknowingly "act it out" (see Volume II). That was the piece I found missing in India.
