For example, many clients and friends tell me that when they decided they wanted to leave (separate) from a therapist or a teacher, they (the therapists or teachers) began to lecture them, scold them, and put them down for asserting their independence. This is also what parents do when teenagers want to leave home and become independent. In ego psychology, there is a belief that by using trance-ference, the therapist can re-parent the client into health or provide the corrective experience Quantum Psychology says, "Any therapist or teacher who believes that you can be the 'good enough' parent in present time and re-parent or provide the corrective experience for a client or student by guiding them through developmental phases into health has counter-trance-ference issues." Why? For two reasons: One, the therapist or teacher is being the "good enough" parent for a price. Secondly, what happened happened, and to imagine that a 1995 therapist can be a parent and "put in" in 1995 what was left out in 1955 is both magical and grandiose thinking on the part of the therapist or teacher.
