I would like for the present time you to say to the undertaker morn, "You were able to bury her energy (this little girl's energy), but you are not able to bury my energy any more." Therapeutic Note Internalized mom and little girl. The only way this little girl identity could stay connected to her mother and be taken care of was to bury her energy the way her mom had buried her own energy when she was a little girl. This is also representative again of what Reich called an emotional plague (see The Murder of Christ) whereby we squash another's life force the way ours was squashed. In other words, Dad squashed your life force, then you internalize Dad and when you see another person you see them through the eyes of the internalized dad and so you feel like you have to squash their life force. Nancy:Well, I feel sadness about seeing that life. I mean that's life energy. That's been squashed and repressed. That's really sad. I think I still do that.
