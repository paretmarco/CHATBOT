In the process of counter-trance-ference you identify more with the mommy/daddy or significant person from the past. This can be best illustrated in relationships. Notice how one partner might act like a child in the relationship while the other might act like the parent. The age-regressed adultxis in trance-ference, acting like a child, while the one acting like a parent is also age-regressed and in counter-tranceference, unknowingly seeing their partner as a child through the eyes of their parent, or you might say seeing their partner as their parents saw them as a child, and then projecting it on their partner. Quantum Psychology sees counter-trance-ference occurring when the person has an internalized other (momidad) and an internalized child. In this process, the person trance-fers the child onto another, and acts like a parent. It should be noted that therapists and teachers can go into trance-ference—making their client into dad or mom—or counter-trance-ference-----becoming a parent and making the client into a child. This usually occurs in forms of psychotherapy which teach therapists that they should be the "good-enough" morn or dad to their clients, guiding them through the developmental phases and giving them the "corrective experience" (to be discussed later).
