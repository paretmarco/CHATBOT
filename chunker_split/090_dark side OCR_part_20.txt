In our culture we all go in and out of trance states, and each of us acts as both hypnotist and subject, through most of our relation- ships. The purpose of this book is to awaken the you behind the trance, so that problems that are caused by trance states no longer can occur. Self-hypnosis and trance happen daily. If you notice the move- Where It All Began for Me + 9 meet of the mind, you are continually offering suggestions to yourself about how to be, what to do, and what to have. For example, you might suggest to yourself in your relation- ship, "He really loves me," creating a relaxed "He really loves me" trance. You might suggest to yourself, "She never gives me what I want," creating an angry trance. You might suggest to yourself, "I know what that (boss) wants; he wants to "cheat me," creating a self-righteous trance. All of these tapes are played by the inner child within the adult. The child within takes on the voices and suggestions of parents, and years later the child within the adult hypnotizes the adult. How does this occur?
