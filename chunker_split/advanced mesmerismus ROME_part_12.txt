================================================= Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) ==================================================== There are two ways of doing non verbal hypnosis: Accompanying Symbolic We advise not to be completely symbolic as you risk to lose yourself in excessive thought and symbolism It is better to mix the two styles You will follow your client through some main axes ===================================================== MAIN AXES: Approaching (Attack) / Going Away (Abandon) Touching or arriving from the right side (father) / Touching or arriving from the left side mother Direct touch (male) / Soft touch (female) / no touch or just small touch (for people that doesnt like touch) The same you can have in sounds ===================================================== In combination with the former elements you can use "words without a meaning" These are words as DOS, DOOH, DEST that have no specific meaning and the mind will create imagination around these sounds ===================================================== INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before.
