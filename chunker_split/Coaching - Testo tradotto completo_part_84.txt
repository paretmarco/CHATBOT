All the scientific studies concur on the following point: To reproduce in the neurons the relaxation associated with a half-asleep condition has the import of “regenerating” both body and brain, mind and muscles. Prof. Clifford Saron from the Center for Mind and Brain at the California University has noticed that, over a number of days, those people who practiced relaxation mentally became ever more rapid, were able to maintain concentration more easily and for longer periods, were less anxious, had greater awareness of their emotions, and knew how to manage them better 22. Prof. Benson, in his book “The Relaxation Response”, shows us how a daily relaxation ranging from ten to fifteen minutes might cause a positive reduction in psychosomatic diseases. The self and tensions Relaxation, both the physical and the psychological types, helps one eliminate the permanent or predominant attention directed onto his own self, which is activated inappropriately due to the fact that such a self is not related by a bond of necessity to anything extrinsic, such as a situation to exploit or an idea to pursue. We must learn from animals and children the art of fully relaxing all those muscles of the body which momentarily have no role to play.
