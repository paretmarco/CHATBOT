Single individuals, too, might have a strong potential deriving from their position of authority which, as will be explained here under, is one of the source elements through which a suggestion can be deeply infixed in the human brain.

There are, moreover, certain particular states, called states of "wakeful” or “vigilant” hypnosis, in which the hypnotized subject engages in actions although he is seemingly fully awake. Several public personalities use their language in such a manner as to induce hypnotic states in their interlocutors. In doing that they pile up their prestige, which on its own is already a hypnotic factor, over some specific linguistic and gesture-based models. We are capable of realizing that by watching how they move their hands and by observing their method of conversing. In some instances, these are abilities which have been acquired spontaneously, whereas, at other times, they represent capacities which have been deliberately mastered.
