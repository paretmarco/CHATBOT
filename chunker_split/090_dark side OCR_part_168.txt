I worked with a woman who was so love addicted to an abusive man that the child within' s dream would not let go. After years of therapy, she continually chose the dream rather than the reality; she dreamed he would change. (He never has). I mention this example because she never gave up the dream, or the abusive man, so intense was her inner child's trance. This dream now comes from the child within the adult, not the present time observer. The task is to wake-up the present time observer from the past time child identity that is dreaming. This is done with the following exercises: 1. Ask yourself where in your body you feel the child who is dreaming. 2. Intentionally create a dream and place it inside the body part where the dreaming child resides. 3. Notice the difference between you and the inner child' s dream. 4. Create the dreaming child several times. The dream is deeply layered in the child and often becomes a major, motivational impetuous for the adult, as a lifestyle or rationale for ongoing behavior.
