SUMMARY Dissociating from our body and animal nature not only dissociates us from the world and from people, but ultimately from the underlying unity as well. It is no wonder that spiritual and psychological philosophies which diminish the body as "not you," or "unimportant," act as impairments to "spiritual" and psychological understanding. They ask us to deny the "body," and in the case of psychology, our "human-animal nature," in favor of our "mind." Once you can appreciate the thinking and emotional world and external world, let your attention be split four ways: 1/4 external, 1/4 thinking, 1/4 emotional and 1/4 biological. Psychological and archetypical explanations are created by the newer brain; hence, they're further from experience and only exist as a way to order the chaos of a shock or of a biological deprivation. Mystification, a creation of the new brain, occurs when the biological animal is repressed. This repression takes us out of biological and into psychological and interpretations which lead to False Conclusions that yield unresolvable False Solutions. We are all going to die. All we know and think we are will die.
