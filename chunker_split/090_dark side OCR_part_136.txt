This concept of the power of thoughts or the power of positive thinking will be dis- cussed in Chapter 14, Spiritualization. To form illusions, the child must shrink her focus of attention to a very small part of total reality, which part becomes magnified and greatly distorted. The remedy for seeing what is not there, is seeing what is there. Illusioning, Futurizing, Fantasizing Often, trances work together to create an illusion. A woman client reported she had been talking with "beings," guides that came to see her. They told her of events in the future, and that she was a chosen person. People would admire her and were waiting for her to become almost like Christ. She was further informed that she would have thousands of followers. These were very strong illu- sions. The problem at this point was she felt very anxious, because she was not ready to become like Christ. The client was reluctant to tell anyone of these illusions for fear she would be thought crazy. As we talked of these beings or guides, she became very young, and I could see in front of me the little girl inside the grown woman.
