In this case, too, the question arose: “What can I possibly do to learn how to build a trading system and use it in an automatic fashion when operating in the market?” It sounds like a utopia, and yet a method of building one such system truly exists. It does last for a short while, though. The truth is that, had an automatic system capable of always reaping gains, regardless of the direction taken by the market, truly existed, sooner or later every trader would start using it. The bottom line is that systems work for a period only, after which they cease to work.
