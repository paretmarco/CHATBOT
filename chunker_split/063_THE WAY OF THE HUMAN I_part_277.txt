This can collapse the thinking dimension with the biology. Identities can prove others crazy because this justifies and gives reasons for you wanting to be separate (sour grapes) (see Volume II). This structure makes for a therapist. We feel crazy and out of control because we deny our natural animal tendencies, labeling them as bad, as something to be controlled. Thus, we cut ourselves off from the biological context of our animal nature. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, the ego (the mediator) between the id (animal) and the superego (society/parents, etc.) must feel crazy. Why? Because the ego is a coping device that sells out the animal for some societally substituted rewards which can never satisfy the biological urges. It would be like your wanting food and someone giving you a photograph of a barbecued chicken, or your wanting sex and someone give you a photograph of a naked man or woman, or your wanting food or sex and someone handing you a dollar bill or a diploma as an attempt to satisfy you. It won't work.
