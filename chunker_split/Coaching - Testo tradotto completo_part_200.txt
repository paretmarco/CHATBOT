General direction in life ***** Single “self-contained” moments placed on one line In order for us to understand how every day is a complete self-contained unit while at the same time being part of a line, we might compare the passing of time, understood in that sense, with the relationship existing between a given social group and the individual members thereof who make it up. Every person within the group is complete, self-sufficient and happy in himself and by himself, and is also independent, and yet, together with the other persons, he represents a larger entity. Things therefore happen in this manner: Pleasures and affections, the whole spectrum of our bodily and spiritual instincts, gather around the practical implementation of our daily commitment 50. The totality of those pleasures, etc, must however gather in such a manner as not to harm the execution of the following day’s imperative task, and so on. At the same time, this is no more than an essential beam allowing us to lend shape and direction to a day in which we might discover new opportunities able to lead us onto some positive paradigm shift.
