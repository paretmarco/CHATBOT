Why? Because sensation is not experienced as sensation. Rather, the thinking and/or the emotional dimension get collapsed with the biological sensation level. When this occurs, interpretations of past emotions are placed on top of sensations themselves. Hence, people judge sensations as "bad" or something to be gotten rid of in some way rather than just having sensations as sensations themselves, without judgment, evaluation or significance placed on them. Unlike psychologies which imagine a body-mind split, to repeat again Korzybski in Science and Sanity refers to the organism as a whole: Experience and experiments show us that the natural order is sensation first, idea next; the sensation being an abstraction of some (lower) (earlier) order, and the idea clearly an abstraction of an abstraction, (sensation). . . . This reversal of order in its mild form is involved in . . or the confusion of orders of abstractions; namely that we act as if an idea were an experience." (p. 76).
