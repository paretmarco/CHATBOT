The observer-observed arose and will subside together, and neither arose and subsided together. The idea of before is an idea of the observer only. In the NOT-I-I and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS there is no before or prior, everything arises and will subside as one piece in NOTIME-TIME. 145 The Way of the Human ■ Beyond Quantum Psychology THE OBSERVER AND THE WITNESS The observer is part of the observed, The WITNESS is pure awareness beyond the observer-observed dyad. Many systems confuse observation and WITNESSING. For example, if I watch a thought—but think I am the " which is watching—then I am observing. If I move "my" arm, and believe it is "I" which moves the arm—then I am observing. If I watch with judgment, evaluation or significance, then it is observing. The WITNESS, on the other hand, is aware, but is not identified with an experiencer or an exerpience nor is it identified with an "I" which is observing it. The WITNESS is beyond even mindfulness, such as "I " am mindful of a psychological pattern. The WITNESS is pure awareness. The WITNESS is amazed at what occurs.
