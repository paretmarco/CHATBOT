To handle that, he created a fantasy of money coming to him. His distress would subside. In both cases, fantasizing worked for the child to handle the situation. Problems arose however when the child within became automatic and time-frozen. When the woman came for therapy, she had a history of picking men she wanted to have take care of her. She never developed a career, and these men did not want to take care of her. She came to my office lamenting, very needy, having driven men away, and without a relationship. The child within the man, in the latter example, was continually obsessing about not having enough money. Instead of working to make a living, he would fantasize money coming to him. The inner child within the man began to develop "New Age" philosophies that believe visualizing money makes it come. (See Chapter 14, Spiri- tualization.) When he came to see me, he was broke, married, living in a trailer, not working, selling possessions for food. Such is the power of the fantasizing trance of "futurizing".
