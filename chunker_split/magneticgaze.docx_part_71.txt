The human personality is made up of a fear to lose the objects of its own fascination. The personality of the average man is a blend that is founded on the fear to lose one’s beloved, money, the house, etc. All the psychological categories we are able to discern grow out of some fundamental fear. Through the medium of fascination, therefore, we give birth to a state of void in which a spontaneous self-reorganization can occur, one that is facilitated by no longer concentrating on the outside, but rather on the inside and on the operator who then turns into a resource. 8. Further comparisons with Eastern techniques The usefulness of being detached from involvement and from external “fascination” is something evidenced even by the comparison between the technique of fascination and some techniques of Trataka (that is, the prolonged staring at an object without flapping one’s eyelids) which are practiced in the East in order to engender a mental void. We can observe that sometimes, in the course of such practices, an image gets crystallized, thereby allowing one to appropriate its qualities. These practices have the further result of distancing one even physically from being involved with the outside.
