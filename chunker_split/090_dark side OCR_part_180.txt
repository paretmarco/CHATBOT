is used, it surrounds the identity and the reason the coping device was formed is not remembered, (i.e., the trauma). Amnesia is forgetting, and it is a defense. Amnesia developed because the observer did not want the child to remember. If someone comes into therapy and says, "Hey, I just can't remem- bell," she also exhibits symptoms such as stopping her breath and holding her muscles, in order to maintain the forgetting. Amnesia is a defense, a way that the observer helped the child to survive the circumstances in which she grew up. When a client verbalizes, "I have the worst memory in the world, and I'd like to work on it," or, "I can't remember what happened, but I sense I was sexually molested," then the strategy for a therapist is very simple. Have them breathe and look at you. This will access the "forgotten" experience. Patterns are held in the body and breath. This is why I suggest that traumatized clients receive some form of body therapy: Rolfing, Bio-Energetics, Feldenkrais, Alexander or massage. Body memories of trauma are buried in the body.
