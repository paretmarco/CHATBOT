Actually, the eye transmits our personality, and afterwards, combined with it, there are other skills to develop, including a fundamental quality called personal magnetism. Let us examine closely an individual who possesses these qualities. 1. His appearance is harmonic. The magnetic individual is often noted at first glance. The concept is that of "personal charm". It does not matter the person is either handsome or ugly: his figure always releases a pleasant impression. His defects do not affect the view proportionally to their importance: on the contrary, what he has best is strangely striking in. In other words, you will see merits, not defects. His eyes have a brightness that gently fascinates. His voice seduces the ear. His attitude is both, sober and natural. 2. He seems to permeate the environment of a penetrating radiation. His presence seems to generate in those who approaches an odd sensation of well-being, a real inner pleasure. With him, the spirit seems to become lighter. The exact word to describe the status is "eurhythmy". In fact, a eurhythmy infinitely sweet is conquering and subduing you, leaving to you a lasting memory. This memory, rather than fade becomes intrusive and soon you are taken by an almost craving desire to relive that ineffable fascination. When you find yourself in the company of the magnetic man, the first impression he gives to you is that he is at rest: he is not nervous, not in a state.
