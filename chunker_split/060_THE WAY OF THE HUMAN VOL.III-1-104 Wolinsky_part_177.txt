Stated another way, when "you experience" that the experiencER, the experience and the problem are one and the same and that everything is interconnected and made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, everything disappears or becomes quantumfied. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Since there is no separate self and no separate object, all there is, is the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. By turning your attention around, the self disappears, is quantumfied. At that "moment" there is a blank on the screen. EXERCISE #19 Turn your attention around and notice if there is a self which is experiencing anything Turn your attention outward and notice an object. Look at an object from No-self and No-me as just pure Awareness. Notice a feeling. Try to find the self that's feeling the feeling, and notice there is just feeling with no feeler. Notice that there is no "you" feeling, that a feeler is contained within the feeling itself. Realize there is just feelings which do not belong to a "you" but just come into and out of the VOID. ________________ Notice an association.
