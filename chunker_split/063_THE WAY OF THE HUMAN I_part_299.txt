To paraphrase the Vijnana Bhairava, from the mere remembrance of what it's like to be touching, pressing, kissing and holding, certain delightful sensations arise inside of you; since there's nobody there they come from you. This seemed very profound to me at the time, that the sensations are coming from inside of me because there's no one there. In other words, if you're fantasizing, and you have the remembrance of those types of things, it brings about such feelings in your body. Since there's nobody there these feelings are coming from inside of you. Therefore, rather than focusing on the fantasy and trying to fulfill it by looking outside of yourself, begin to shift your attention. This simply means moving your 190 Chapter VIII attention off of the fantasy and into the experience itself as energy, rather than seeing it as sexual energy and something to work with. It's energy, it's not good or bad, wrong right, high or lowâ€”it's simply energy. I remember saying to Baba Prakashananda that I was having problems with my second chakra. Babaji said, "Only one chakra: energy."
