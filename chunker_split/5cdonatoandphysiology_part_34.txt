That is an unnecessary activity added to the basic condition of just being...just observing. Fascination gets these results using many elements connected to eyes accommodation. Accommodation Accommodation to natural vistas depends in a complicated way on: The dark focus of the individual, The retinal locus The spatial frequency of visible texture, The sharpness of focus needed for the discrimination of object identity, for example, reading a sign. In fascination we observe: - Dark Focus position will be influenced by several conditions, and become nearer the more the individual is excited - Retinal Locus is better on the left on the individual, as vision is different from left to right - When sharpness of focus is increased results are faster ALTERATION IN SENSORY PERCEPTIONS - THE "BIG FACE" The apparent size of an object changes with shifts in the distance to which the eye is accommodated. This phenomenon happens in fascination, where the face of the operator become big and can even be a sign of entering a specific state as it is physiological as well psychological as it touches what we call "dimension" of an object, that is also a psychological construction.
