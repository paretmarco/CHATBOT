Knots are meant to be loosened Many people have the tendency of formulating extremely long-term plans, or to allow themselves to be intimidated by the fact that certain results appear to extend too far into the future.

A mind which is ever more focused, in fact, might be able to perceive opportunities which initially eluded its attention.
