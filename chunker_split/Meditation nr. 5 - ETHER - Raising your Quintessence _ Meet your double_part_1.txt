Meditation nr. 5 - ETHER What is your real I? Many times we feel that is another I in ourselves. An I that knows better than our actual I I who we are. The initiate chevalier, after having worked on himself, liberates the divine seed in his heart. This dimension is called "the double" We get in contact with an higher dimension of ourself The quality to develop here is SENSITIVITY. Try to be sensitive to your inner being and also to the other ones around you. Ether - Quintessence: Meeting our double Practising presence is like a travel The goal is getting back in connection with ourselves. This other ourself comes out in dreams, in intuitions. Why the double image of the knight? We are double. There is an elevated part of us. And at the same time another part of us in the matter. To connect them we must come back to the present. How can we practice? As we walk. Try to stay very aware of yourself. Try to feel your body You will notice a sensation behind you This sensation will be of something strong that you always have behind you Your gaze must be completely open Two half moons your eyes Progressively you will understand the meaning of the ancient templar seal with a knight sitting behind another knight Chivalry of the Graal After having gone through the first level of the initiation a higher power was born.
