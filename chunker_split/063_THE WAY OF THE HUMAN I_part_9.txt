What begins to occur is that upon inquiry not only does the imaging and the notions disappear but so does the imager the notioner and ultimately the knower. xi For this reason, Quantum work asks readers to question and "look at" the concepts and psychic structures by which you define, organize and justify the "you" "you" call "yourself," be they spiritual or psychological, and to go beyond them. Questioning is not an irreverent sin or a sacrilegeâ€”rather, it is the duty and responsibility of every sincere "seeker." We need to question the underlying assumptions of psychological and spiritual practice to see how they might re-enforce, mask or hide much deeper structures which lie beneath the surface. Ques tioning is imperative to understanding "why am I not getting much out of my psychological or spiritual practice even after years." Maybe, the practices are not right for you maybe they re-enforce deeper patterns, or maybe their effects and limitations have been overstated or understated respectively. But once you begin to explore, you might be surprised how these practices which are supposed to "liberate" actually re-enforce self-fulfilling concepts thus continuing our underlying presuppositions about who we think we are.
