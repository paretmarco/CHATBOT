Such a kink of phenomenon is a "behavioural occurrence of daily trance". [44] If we were to examine it in detail, we would actually unveil the truth that, rather than being merely a single trance, the aforesaid example evinces the existence of a series of micro-trances. The first trance that takes place is part of a phenomenology of amnesia. Our subject, despite having told us a short while earlier that she would have restrained herself, no longer remembers the promise she made. The second “trance” consists in a time regression to an earlier age: Why, in fact, does she eat the sweet? She is behaving like a child facing a table fully laid out with food, and so on. Our life, which we believe to be “fully conscious”, is saturated with such kinds of phenomena. Some people, in order to indicate this concept, are accustomed to state that most of human beings “are asleep” instead of being inside reality.
