The trance-fer of the parent to idealized parent to the God who grants grace by giving rewards, or a fall from the parental/God path or grace and receiving punishments, is a process the child frequently goes through. From the infant' s point of view, it is by the power of parents/Gods that the child came to earth. Why? Because to an infant, his whole universe, life and death are dependent upon parents/God. The infant/child remains frozen within the adult seeking "the answer," or ways to get to heaven, peace or liberation. Often this is trance-fered to a teacher or guide who gives the answer to the question, "how do I get free?" Transpersonal trance-ference onto guides or teachers who have the answers, similar to parents, runs parallel. For example, many clients I have worked with look for their purpose or the meaning of life, seeking teacher after teacher for that "higher purpose." The problem is that the infant/child within is running the show. The infant/child within the adult is the seeker. This is a very age-regressed, and pre-verbal trance, which requires the looking to another for power, love, or enlightenment, rather than to oneself.
