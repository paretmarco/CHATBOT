A New Understanding of Trances and Hypnosis Some people feel that trance and hypnosis are similar to the Svengali Phenomenon, in which the subject is overpowered and instructed to do something against his/her will, by an outside power 8 *The Dark Side of the Inner Child or person. Sometimes hypnosis is thought of as a state resembling sleep, induced by a hypnotizer, who makes suggestions readily accepted by the subject. "Trance" is defined by Webster's as "a state of partly suspended animation or inability to function, a state of prolonged absorption." (American College Dictionary, Random House, New York, 1963:1285) From my years of psycho-spiritual inner work, it became clear to me that we are all already in a trance, already hypnotized. Most of us think "trances" exclude our daily experience, but actually they engulf our every experience. Within the mystery of hypnosis or trance lies the key to de-hypnosis. What will follow are examples and histories of everyday people being "entranced." A child is the subject, the mom and dad the hypnotists.
