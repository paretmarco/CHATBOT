Naturally, this WHO AM I quest (as mentioned in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I) began as far back as "I" can remember. So there is the organization of the material to be dealt with. Then, the reader's previous knowledge of Quantum Psychology has to be called into question as a context for the trilogy. The trilogy attempts to stand on its own; but, it is highly recommended that Quantum Consciousness, Volume I and The Tao of Chaos, Quantum Consciousness, Volume II be considered as aids so that readers can appreciate and expand their context and understanding of this work. This chapter is an attempt to give an overview of some of the basic principles of Quantum Psychology and in which Volume of the Trilogy "I" will focus on what specific subject. Hopefully, this "never-ending story" does reach an end and conclusion in Volume III, Beyond Quantum Psychology. Readers might be tempted to flip to the end to see "who done it," as if they were reading a detective novel but my suggestion is to go through each Volume from beginning to end because the ending is the surprise you always knew.
