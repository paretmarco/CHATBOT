This conscious awareness is going to make us forget the materiality of the acts which the relevant work consists of, as those acts would no longer be a goal in themselves but only a means to an end. We will, in short, view professional work more through the spirit of the glutton who, as he prepares some tasteful meal, gladly endures the tedium of cleaning, mixing, frying, and greasing, because he can taste in advance the fruit of his patient and sagacious work. It is within the ambit of this section of intellectual activity that the economic aspect, as indicated before, finds its place. Economic aspirations, too, vary remarkably from person to person. When one says jokingly that money does not make one happy, although to own money is a form of happiness, he is making a statement which is partly true and partly false.
