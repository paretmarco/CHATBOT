In truth, we look more often at the people who interest us or who are to our liking than at the others. Provided the eye is appositely trained, its power will be amplified. Although each person has in himself the peculiar psychological and mental elements which enable him to impact on his fellow human beings, not every one makes use of such elements to the same degree. We use the term "persuasive fascination" to denote the practical application of fascination within the context of daily communication. The most glaring and typical manifestation of “personal power" consists in the art of persuading 95. The person who holds the keys to that art is readily believed in respect of whatever he says, and evinces a form of hegemony over his fellow human beings. Apart from the aspect of competence, personal success rests on a person’s capacity to adequately manage his own aptitude in establishing relationships with other people. The laws governing such results are intrinsic to man’s very nature. Let us imagine a world devoid of any civilization: The world in which primitive man used to interact with his likes.
