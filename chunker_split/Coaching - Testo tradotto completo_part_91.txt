You should direct this force to your body, which is an instrument for it. You must avoid, at the time when your hand is going to infix this needle, mixing this plan with any other project, the aim of which is to accomplish something else. Were you to do otherwise, you would be dispatching your force — or at least attempting to dispatch it— to two directions at the same time. Every impatient thought or act, no matter how small, will cost you a loss of strength without letting you realize any profit. If sometimes you feel tired of walking, while your brain has worked, tortured itself, and elaborated some projects, you should then banish away all these thoughts and gather your whole intelligence, your whole attention, your whole strength, on your legs, whereupon you would be surprised to feel vigour coming back and exhaustion disappearing”. This law equally applies to all of one’s acts in life. You must train yourselves to concentrate on one act only, and you must train yourselves to pour the plenitude of your intelligence on the entirety of your acts.
