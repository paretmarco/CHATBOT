As "I" mentioned earlier, Nisargadatta Maharaj once said, "You must first know what something is before you can give it up." 'This process was originally written about in Trance People Liveâ€”Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology (1991), 'The Shuranyama Sutra, Buddhist Text Translation Society, Volume 3 (1980), California: The Sino-American Buddhist Association, p. 22. 4Please note that differentiated consciousness possesses a separate "1" which has all the psychological aspects of preferences, comparisons, etc. UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS does not have or know preferences or comparisons. UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is VOIDer than the VOID itself and has no separate "I." Hence, the Zen patriarch said "The great way is easy, except for those who have preferences." THOUGHT is the single act of thinking; an idea or a notion.' INTERNAL DIALOGUE: Also referred to in Trances People Live as a post-hypnotic suggestion. These are internal voices which suggest certain outcomes. For example, the internal voice: "It will never work out," or "I know you're going to break up with me so I'll detach and won't het involved."
