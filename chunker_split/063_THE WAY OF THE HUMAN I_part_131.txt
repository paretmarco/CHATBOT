Practice: First, pick an object in the room. Now I'd like you to begin to pull back your attention. In other words, your attention is moving forward, going out toward a particular object, like the couch, for instance. Pull your attention back. As you look at an object, pull your energy back prior to having the impression or knowledge of the object. A student commented that she could get beyond the knowledge of the object except for its color. "You will continue to see the color," I said, "but it will no longer register as, say, the rug in the living room. In other words, the color is still there, it's not going to disappear, but you're moving, withdrawing your energy prior to the thought and impression, even the knowledge of it. I'd like you to pair up with a partner for this next practice. Practice: Let your eyes close for a second, then make eye contact with your partner. Let your attention withdraw, prior to any knowledge or information or any impressions or thoughts you have about that person. Turn your attention backward, withdrawing it backward.
