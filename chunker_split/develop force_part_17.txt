It is in our look that the person facing us discerns the truth of who we are and where we are heading for. Eye in the Tradition The eye has always been at the heart of human culture, transmuted into a symbol, at the center of ritual ceremonies, and a protagonist in metaphors. It is the most precious sensory organ in the human body: It allows us to become aware of the surrounding environment, and assists us in creating the three-dimensional perception of space. The eye has been perennially linked to “knowledge”, owning the world and dominating it. The eye is, moreover, the sensory organ that is most closely related to light, which is an element that is fundamental to life 15. The eye is an essential organ of man, both as regards his life and his distinct individuality. We can discern both the following in the traditions that relate to this organ: • An attention that is extended to each one of the two eyes, which are related to pairs of opposite principles (sun and moon, male and female, etc); • An attention which is focused on the point between the two eyes, seen as a central locus and as the point in which intuitive faculties might be developed. In the practice of fascination through the look, both these elements are of significance, due to the fact that the median point between the eyes is one of the points which were traditionally used in order to observe this point itself.
