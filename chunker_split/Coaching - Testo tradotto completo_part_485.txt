Whoever thinks “he knows”, conversely, is actually “generalizing” and making speculative conjectures about the future having the ability to fully reproduce the past. What is even worse, however, is the scenario where generalizations transmogrify into “hallucinations” properly so-called. Traders’ hallucinations In the technical lexicon of hypnosis, the term "hallucination" is used to define an image which corresponds to something that is physically not there (the hypnotist, for example, says there is a chair where no such object is present, and yet the subject “sees” it); an illusion is in turn describable as a "modification of reality" (the subject, to give an illustration, sees a chair and thinks it is a bicycle, whereupon he climbs on it and begins to pedal). A generalization is nearly a species of "hallucination/illusion". What essentially occurs, as far as trading is concerned, is that we alter reality so as to bring it in greater line with our thought, to make it resemble to a greater extent a previous experience we went through to before.
