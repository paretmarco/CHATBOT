The most important step is to add context. This is done by expanding the focus of attention or trance so that the person includes the whole trigger, i.e., by allowing the whole face, not just the left eye, resources will emerge spontaneously from the client. Needless to say it is the continual expansion of the focus of attention or awareness of the inner child that allows the observer/creator to emerge and take back the power from the inner child. Conclusion In the final analysis, an individual is "stuck" because the inner child does not allow choice. The adult does not experience choice. The stimulus response worked for the inner child and the adult decides this is the way the world is. These conclusions, along with the trances shrinking the focus of attention, create a shrinking number of choices and available resources. Appendix I 4 165 Consequently, the more associations and creation of new mean- ings the inner child has, the weaker the "fixed" attention of the inner child becomes. Principle X: The more attention is narrowed and de- creased, the more the choices and resources are narrowed and decreased.
