On the one hand, this resolute conviction in our negligibility will render us less selfish, by making us acquainted with the extent of foolishness and ignorance which causes one to pretend that every person should be concerned with our affairs, whereas, on the other hand, it will make us more healthily selfish by conferring on us the coolness which is needed for the realization of the most arduous tasks. What is more is that we will also learn how to avoid that excessive earnestness which represents one of the major stumbles on the path to enjoying life and developing a more open-minded vision of it. Hardly, if at all, does the destiny of the world depend on the self of any one of us. As far as the world is concerned, we are in fact nothing. We should then pay the world back with the same coinage. That way, we will first and foremost learn how to strip every fact of its emotional content, by reducing it to its stark objective nature. Due to the fact that an idea is devoid of any consequence unless it is coloured by sentiment either in black or in pink, we must keep on training the spirit to welcome ideas in a calm way.
