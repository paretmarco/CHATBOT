QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater your connection to your BIOLOGICAL CORE, and the natural alignment of the gravitational pull of the sun and the earth, the greater your connection to the external world as one solid unity. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater your connection to the BIOLOGICAL CORE, the greater will be the probability that "you" might experience unity or experience the body as made of the same substance as everything else. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The more you are aware of the BIOLOGICAL CORE, the more making decisions becomes a nonissue, life becomes a nonissue and your psychology becomes a non-issue, you just are, things just occur. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The BIOLOGICAL CORE is the vehicle for the thinking and feeling dimensions. When they are aligned, there is pure being at a biological level: The NON-VERBAL I AM. Simply put, doing, or walking in your being occur. The being naturally becomes functional in its movement. That is the Tao, and what it means to be in your BIOLOGICAL CORE. In this way, the BIOLOGICAL CORE is what you cannot live fully without.
