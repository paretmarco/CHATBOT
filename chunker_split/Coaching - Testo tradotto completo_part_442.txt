Suddenly, the fear of falling seizes your being; your legs are shaking, you are breathing heavily, and your vision is getting blurred. If you, instead of losing control, were to successfully reason out things coolly, to study your position the way a surveyor who is specialized in topography would do, to ask yourselves: «Is it or not factually possible for me to walk through this track», then the difficulty, the level of predicament you are facing, would be vastly reduced. A corroborating proof of the aforesaid is that a careless child will firmly move along that track, whistling some tune as he does so, whereas you had trembled at the idea of carrying out precisely what he executed so nonchalantly. Any fact is either arbitrary or not. If it is indeed arbitrary, make your decision after a moment of pensive reflection; if it is not, give it up, exactly as you would relinquish the idea of landing on the moon, or else accept it a-critically as it is, without any further ado.
