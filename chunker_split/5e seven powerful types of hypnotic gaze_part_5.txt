There is also an internal reason. This practice is useful to make the mind still and clear. Raja Yoga in India and corresponding western traditional disciplines have always stressed the importance of being able to create one-pointedness in our mind. As body and mind are connected, one-pointedness in this way is not only mental, but also physical through the sense of sight. This training involves therefore exercising our attention, otherwise dispersed, and our concentration. To learn how to do it well, you need to begin exercising on looking at a point without closing your eyelids and with the least internal chattering. At the beginning your eyes will begin to tear after a few seconds. Do not despair. Just close them, wait some seconds, and afterwards try again. Continue practicing. A good way is to have 15 minutes each day to do it. These exercises must be undergone seriously for optimal results, as a promise you are making to yourself. On our site of magnetism there is a free course available on this kind of training writing at mesmerismus_eng@getresponse.com . You will find further ideas on staring. Staring is not just physical.
