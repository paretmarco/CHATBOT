The rest of the mind is not, however, a form of idleness, contrary to what some people think; it is rather the means we have at our disposal to «digest», to activate our quantum functioning and extract from what is formless that organic and living substance which is represented by a genial thought. It is known to all and sundry that genial discoveries have been made by their authors at the time they were thinking about them the least: As they were taking a walk, while they were conferring with one another or reading a newspaper, etc. A genial thought explodes, so to speak, out of the blue. But does that mean it springs out of nowhere? Not so. As we are aware, genial men were devotees of work. They were, however, workers who knew how to rest. Second Phase = Unconscious focusing The world is brimful of eager workers, who nevertheless never rise above mediocrity, because they never know how to “digest” what they swallow. That is why relaxation and being in a state of mental void are important. You must learn, therefore, to let the mind rest the way you are able to do with the body.
