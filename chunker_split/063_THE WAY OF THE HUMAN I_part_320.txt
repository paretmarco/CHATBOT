In the words of the Arica master Oscar Ichazo: The accumulation of experiences in my paracon- sciousness results in the formation of abstract con- 208 Special Section cepts called structure patterns which my psyche uses to explain reality.. Since my explanation of external reality is rooted in structure patterns which originate in accumulated . . . [past] experiences, my psyche cannot explain the present except in terms of the past. (The Fourteen Pillars of the Perfect Recognition). Notice how Ichazo understands that the present time is experienced as the past, as long as past-time structures, such as tranceference, are still operating. Let us define transference: Transference is the displacement or projection of the patient's feelings, attitudes, reactions, or thoughts that properly belong to significant figures of the past onto the analyst. (Marshall and Marshall, 1988). This rather traditional definition of the trance of transference was considered by many to be Freud's greatest contribution to the understanding of the therapist-client relationship. To further appreciate the implications of trance-ference, let us first look at the major components stressed in two earlier books, Trances People Live and The Dark Side of the Inner Child.
