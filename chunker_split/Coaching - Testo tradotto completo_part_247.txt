It is true inasmuch as wealth, or at least a state of material comfort, can alone enable one to fully taste life, which, conversely, is so monotonous and painful for the indigent people; it is at the same time false, because wealth has no fixed boundary, such that one either moves from unhappiness to happiness or turns from happy to happier depending on whether or not he has crossed it. From an economic point of view, the happy person is he who owns sufficient means to appease his range of appetites. Each one of us has a specific capacity to enjoy, which is limited by oneâ€™s physical constitution, age, temperament, and mental inclinations. The fiery, active temperaments which manifest themselves positively are in general in greater need of money than the passive, submissive and contemplative temperaments. Development of soul and spirit Moving back to the sphere of intellectual activity, it is worth discussing in this context, in addition to one's professional activity, which we have already hinted at, the so-called disinterested activity, i.e. activity of our choice and activity devoted to developing the spirit. If we want to evolve, we must become enriched in our spirit.
