The one who enjoys more, and thus also suffers more, is in that case he who is more sensitive to stimuli. Is there, however, a pleasure which is endlessly renewed? Yes, it exists, and it is in actual fact the one we are guiding you to through this work. Such an enduring pleasure consists, then, in being present not only to the sequence of life events (and, consequentially, to our own goal or ideal), but even to the current moment. The key to pleasure is not to be found in tension, unlike the way many people believe, but rather in attention. Pleasure is born out of the fact that one is in the present moment. It is represented by the ability to see reality as it is, to awaken ourselves to the perception of the world and thereby exit the routine, habit-driven mechanisms which debar us from experiencing wonderment. The pleasure is in the now. Tedium is solely generated when we let ourselves be taken as captives by habit, with the result that we then enter a state of automatic mechanisms. The key to serenity, therefore, is to taste pleasure in the now.
