When you label sexual sensations as bad, not only do you reinforce the fusion that they are bad but you also drive this natural biological response metaphorically upward, further away from experience, creating thoughts and philosophies which only reinforce and justify repression. Dissociating from sensation can occur as sensations intensify and you yourself disappear or dissociate. For this reason, first become grounded in your body, developing the ability to have and be a container for sensation. Once that occurs, you will naturally realize your body is made up of the same substance as everything else. If you are unwilling to have the body as it is, you will never stabilize in this awareness. If this step does not occur, dimensions and boundaries collapse leaving a person without the ability to be aware of separation, while simultaneously being aware of the underlying unity. TANTRIC YOGA The ability to have and contain sensation first is paramount in the practice of Tantric yoga. This yogic practice utilizes sensation to expand awareness. Its aim is to develop the ability to contain an intense amount of sensation and then be able to turn the attention around and see that the sensation is made of the same substance as everything else.
