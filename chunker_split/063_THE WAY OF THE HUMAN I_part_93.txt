Or if you went to a Rolfer, or to a Feldenkreis person, they might say bodywork can do it all, it does not. Every system has limitations as well as a very strong suit. And it is important to acknowledge at which level your system and you are going to be working in order to use them appropriately. Feldenkreis is fantastic, as is Rolfing. Is it going to change your phobia? Probably not. Is it going to dismantle your False Core? Probably not. But it will help you to integrate your experiences more fully. When you integrate all the dimensions of manifestations, you can walk around and live your life and still keep an awareness of ESSENCE, the I.AM, etc. Now, let us imagine an over-emotional client who goes to a psychotherapist. If he goes into an emotional release type of therapy, he will never get better. All this will do is reinforce his False Core-False Self distractions (see Volume II). If you have somebody who is schizoid, on the other hand, they are over-observers and use thinking as a defense against feeling, and dissociate from their emotions.
