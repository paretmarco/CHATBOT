It is my purpose to outline in this book many of the concepts and ideas that have come clear to me over the past 20 years working with clients, so that people can take the next step; de-hypnotize their own inner child, put it to rest, and move on in their lives. I am proposing a model of "recovered," rather than "in recovery" for a lifetime.
