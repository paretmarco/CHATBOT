Turning now to the accelerated or “modern” way, it is essential to emphasize that it is the method we practice more often. It is the same as the preceding one in terms of being structured around the said two moments, save that it will no longer be necessary to be either in the evening or in the morning for us to fulfil their purposes. This accelerated way might accordingly be gone through at any particular time of the day or the night, which explains why it is the version we normally require to be implemented in the course of our seminars. We shall utilize light as a form of aid. We will start by thinking about what we desire (until we succeed, as with the first method described by us earlier, in creating an “accumulation of thought”), and we will move from there to the task of staring at the light for some thirty seconds. As a last step, we are going to shut our eyes without thinking of any thing, staying anchored in the present and limiting ourselves to merely observe the luminous trace in the back of our closed eyes.
