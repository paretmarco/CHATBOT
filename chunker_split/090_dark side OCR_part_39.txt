Trance states are related to the flow of consciousness. They are states that are halts, distortions, and restrictions. Trance requires a shrinking of the focus of attention yielding symptomatic states of consciousness, or what are commonly called limitations and prob- lems. To de-hypnotize is to shift from a trance state of shrunken or contracted feeling to the expanded experience of being an observer! creator, thus freeing yourself. Over the past several years, I have continued to notice in my clinical practice that all symptoms my clients present have at least one trance associated with them. Stated another way, it has become very obvious that, in order for a problem to remain a problem, there must be at least one trance that the inner child's dark side uses like glue to hold the problem state together. The inner child identity sticks like glue to you, the observer, preventing you from experienc- ing present-time reality. Without the trance the symptom could not repeat itself again and again in different situations. As I began to define the trances of the dark side of the inner child, my task with my clients became one of de-hypnosis, or awakening the creator/observer from a deep trance or spell of which clients were unaware.
