The basic thinking error in personalization is that you interpret each experience, each conversation, each look as a clue to your worth and value. (McKay, 1981:21) When I'm late, my partner personalizes, "He doesn't love me." Somebody doesn't like my seminar, and I ask, "What did I do wrong?" When you are not personalizing, you realize this partner is always late, it doesn't pertain to me, or this person always says bad things about everyone. It's not just me. It's not personal. The personalizing style of hypersensitivity comes from a parent who is personalizing. For example, I worked with a woman who personalized everything her husband said. If her husband said, "I'm mad at you," she would go into the inner child identity and feel like there was something wrong with her. The key to this understanding is that in order to personalize you have to age-regress and become the wounded inner child and treat present time as if it were the past.
