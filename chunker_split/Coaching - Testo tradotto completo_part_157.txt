The intention, the desire to exercise a special influence on one individual from that pair, will channel most of your irradiation in his direction. Yet such irradiation operates in accordance with a way which reflects your own psycho-physical balance. If it is potent but disorderly, such irradiation will cause perturbing irritation; whereas, if you happen to be calm and full of serenity, but at the same time devoid of power of accumulation, or with an inadequate externalizing tension, your influence will prove to be sweet but hardly pronounced. Perfect self-control is required. If you do not learn how to dominate your emotions, you will be amenable to experiencing continuous losses of magnetism, which will have the effect of weakening your personal influence to a degree commensurate with the extent of any such loss. However little you might feel impressed, you will then experience a typical constriction in our epigastric area, precisely by the solar plexus, which is, on the other hand, the very centre from which influence radiates.
