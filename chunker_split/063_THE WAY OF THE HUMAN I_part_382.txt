Her spiritual premises also showed, by her inability to work, an expectation that God or the universe (i.e., the object mother, now her husband) would take care of her. There developed a deep confusion within her when this did not occur. I walked over to her, holding my hand near her head and asked, "Can you see a difference between my hand and your head?" "Yes," she said. "Can you feel a difference between my hand and your shoulder'?" "No." In other words, she bad no boundaries. For homework I asked her to see a picture frame around her husband this week to hopefully begin the long process of creating clearer boundaries. HATCHING The hatching period is the time when the infant hatches out of symbiotic union with the mother and begins to differentiate her/ himself from mom. This is the time of beginning to walk, talk, etc. The more the symbiotic partner helps the infant to become ready to hatch from the symbiotic orbit smoothly and gradually—that is, without undue strain upon his own resources—the better equipped the child becomes to separate out and to differentiate his self-representations from the hitherto fused symbiotic self- plus-object representations.
