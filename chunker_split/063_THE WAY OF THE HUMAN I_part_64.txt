In this way Quantum Psychology cooks the uncooked seeds of your psychology in the fry- ing pan of awareness so that they can no longer sprout and bear fruit. Now, in India you have gurus meditating their brains out, sitting somewhere in ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc. most of the ________________ Chapter II time. Whenever they need anything on a personal level, it is taken care of. If they're hungry, people bring food, if their clothes are dirty, people clean them. Then, they come to America or Western Europe. The context (external dimension) changes and their False Core-False Self kicks in causing their uncooked seeds to sprout. Soon they get into money, sex, creating meditation centers, etc. To explain this contradiction to their followers, bigger and better spiritual denial techniques have to be employed. For example, sex is no longer sex, it is tantra; seeking fame and money is not seeking fame and money, it is having a calling or a mission from God. Soon they wind up on the front cover of Yoga Journal! They have not acknowledged their False Core-False Self (uncooked seeds).
