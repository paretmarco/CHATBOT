866 There are other forms of magic, and much more detail to the forms I described. There are also ethical considerations. This paper provides a description of some aspects of the integration of quantum mechanics with magickal thinking, but it does not cover everything. SO WHAT? To read about theories of magic is like reading about sports. You may pick up a few ideas; but to become proficient, you must participate and play the game. People have been teaching and performing magic for thousands of years, without the benefit of quantum theory. Many magicians have had to separate their scientific training from their magical practice. Now, magical theory has been merged with scientific theory, and more of the mind of those trained in science can resonate with magic. Also, critics of magic can be shown the scientific theory and data validating it, to show that there is more to magic than superstition. I have not seen any other quantitative scientific theories that explain the results of experiments on psychokinesis, extrasensory perception, and consciousness as accurately as Walker's theory, or that give as satisfying of an explanation of the synchronicities that I, as a worker of magic and a scientist, have observed from personal experience.
