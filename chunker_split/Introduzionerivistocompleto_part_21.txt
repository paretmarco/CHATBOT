This type of person tends to focus on the other and is more passive than reactive. Hand movements are open or in a triangle position. PART FOUR: REPRESENTATIONAL OR SENSORIAL SYSTEMS From the beginning of time, all traditions have leaned towards the belief that perception of reality is a product of the senses. In recent times, NLP and other methods have thrown new light on what this really means. We do not directly perceive reality: we see (and feel, … etc) what our minds perceive of reality. What we distinguish as reality, we translate into internal representations that have an influence on our behavior and, therefore, condition it. Behavior strategies are created on the basis of the information we receive from our surroundings through our sensory channels. A subjective behavior model is the “world map that isn’t the world”. Representational systems are the sensorial formalities through which individual experience is given meaning. Information is collected through all sensorial channels, but is elaborated through a few favored ones following a given strategy. Every human being depicts the world, favoring at all times one of three channels (visual; auditory; coenaesthesis) from which s/he derives his/ her representational system from primary reality. The other two intervene to a lesser degree; in fact, they are defined as secondary representational systems. For example, one person may pay more attention to appearance rather than consistency, another to sound, … etc It can be useful to understand and tune into others’ strategies to create a better rapport.
