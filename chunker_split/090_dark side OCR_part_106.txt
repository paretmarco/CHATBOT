Spend a minute noticing the voices telling you things inside your head, and notice if you can discern whose voices they are (mother, father, teacher, brother, sister, etc.). The dark side of the inner child limits the adult by continuing to talk to him or her self, often forecasting behavioral inevitabilities ("It will never work"), or suggesting what he or she should or shouldn't have done ("You shouldn't have said what you feel"). In cognitive therapy, "shoulds" are considered a thinking distortion. "In this distortion, you operate from a list of inflexible rules of how you and others should act. The rules are right and 66 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child indisputable. Any deviation from your particular values are bad. As a result, you are often in a position of judging and finding fault." (McKay, 1981:24) In Gestalt therapy, "shoulds" are considered parental injunc- tions and are referred to as the "top dog." The child who "wants" is the underdog. In this situation, the child is in a double bind.
