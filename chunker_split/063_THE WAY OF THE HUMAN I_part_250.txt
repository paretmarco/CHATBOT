Upon entering a car (specific external [context] dimension), the person then enters the past time body image of the accident which has been frozen. As another example, let's imagine a five-year old is molested. Later during sex (specific eternal [context] dimension), they enter into the same past-time body image and hence experiences the same bodily experience in present time through the vehicle of the past-time image of being five years old. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: In order to experience your present time body, past time body images must be dissolved. In this way, you can have your present time biology without being fixated on the past or your past time body image. On a biological level, just as at a psychological level, there is a tendency to fuse with another, usually a parent, as a survival mechanism. In biology, there is a survival strategy for merging, which is the survival of the species. At a biological level, human beings have a merger responsea natural biological tendency to merge.
