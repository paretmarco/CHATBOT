Extending the help which the unconscious provides It is not only the acts of conservation, however, which ought to find their place within such modus operandi. Many more actions than what we might presume can be relinquished to the help of the unconscious: Break up the action, the work, into so many logically concatenated small actions, that is, into a series of small actions which are arranged in such a way that any one of them is going to inevitably summon the next one into being. Those difficulties which had previously appeared to be huge will then disappear as if through magic. One practicable method consists in reducing to a bare minimum the voluntary and conscious effort which is required to kick-start any thing. That is achieved by breaking up the act to be carried out into a sequence of minor acts. The beginning of a race consists in one initial step, the first part of swallowing up a bitter medicine is accosting the glass to one's lips, and the ignition key of a declaration of love is opening one's mouth!
