Gautama, the Buddha and founder of Buddhism, has as his most basic tenet, that there is no individual soul or self which transmigrates (incarnates) from lifetime to lifetime. However, throughout the world, this basic tenet of Buddhism has been ignored, lost and forgotten, and instead, we are offered a soul which incarnates again and again. This incarnation theory, said not to exist by Buddha, is still professed by popular teachers, that we are not the body, but rather a spirit which inhabits the body. ________________ Chapter VIII This can be illustrated by a story from the Buddhist tradition. One day a student of Buddhism asked the Buddha about the WITNESS. The Buddha replied by holding up his sandal and saying, "This [the sandal] is the WITNESS." Buddha was demonstrating that everything--not only mind, but body, spirit, the witness, even his sandalâ€”is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.
