Problems arise when the identity distortion becomes context- independent, or when the identity distortion becomes stuck and begins to function autonomously, without regard for interpersonal feedback from the family, school, or relationships. As an example, a child with no musical ability who imagines himself being admired as a rock and roll star operates without interpersonal feedback. It is the interpersonal feedback that enables the self-to-self trance of the child within to be questioned, so that the observer can let go of its creation. Developmentally, without appropriate interpersonal in- teractions, the trance becomes more solid. To move smoothly through this developmental experience, requires an appropriate interpersonal environment.
