What he did not understand, however, was that the nervous system is also condensed EMPTINESS and, hence, an abstraction of the Quantum world rather than the other way around. Metaphorically and anthropomorphically speaking, the Quantum world is an ocean and the nervous system a wave. The wave (nervous system) is only aware of the ocean from its own limited point of view. But Korzybski did not appreciate that the nervous system was a by-product of the condensed quantum EMPTINESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Because of this lack of understanding he could only claim in 1933 that EMPTINESS was incorrect and should be called Fullness or phelum. His misunderstanding was partly the result of the lack of scientific data at that time. Actually it is neither EMPTINESS or FULLNESSâ€”because in order to call it that there would have to be an "I" (Nervous System) there to say it was so. Furthermore, he could not know, for example, what the eminent physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking would say in A Brief History of Time that "in the beginning there was NOTHINGNESS."
