In other words, your perceptions must be grounded in physical reality otherwise you will be misled by the infantile understanding which collapses the levels and manifests as the distortionâ€”"If I control my internal (beliefs, images, etc. ), I can control my external" (the world). This can be related back to a child who, when they control their feelings, actions, thoughts, etc., mom or dad gives them what they want. They are told by mom and dad they got what they wanted because they deserved it for being good. Years later, they trance-fer mom and dad onto the world or God, imagining if they control their internal, and are good and virtuous, according to mom/dad's standards, they will get what they want from the world or God (mom/dad). because they deserve it. If you don't handle the external world and pay attention to the context in which you are living, at some point it will come up and bite you. You'll be blind-sided. The external world will pull up that which is unprocessed (uncooked seeds).
