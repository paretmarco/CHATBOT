This is a good sign of effectiveness. Then suggest a longer and longer space or gap between the painful sensations. It becomes very apparent that the sensation can then be further regulated utilizing appropriate suggestions. 6. Classical approach - acute pain: In the classical approach, the area to anesthetize can be marked off by imagining a mental circle around the painful area. Suggest that if the pain is in an ankle, for example, to see the leg as transparent, and see particularly the wiring of the nerves that carry the painful sensations of the leg. Eventually, the route of the nerves ("wiring") can be traced into the back of the brain. Suggestions offered for visualizing can be of a computer room or a telephone switchboard, where the wires con- nect from the ankle into the switchboard or into the computer room in the brain. Then (with permission of the unconscious), disconnect the painful sensations. Appendix II â€¢ 171 Conclusion As with all self-trancing, this chapter deals with present-time choice.
