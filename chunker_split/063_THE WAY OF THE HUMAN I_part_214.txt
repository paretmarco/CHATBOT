QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Changing inferences and maps only impacts the thinking dimension. The "I" trying to make the changes is part of the nervous system and thought itself. This is why change is so hard. Within each thought or belief (since it is a by-product of the nervous system) is the survival mechanism (fight/flight) of the nervous system itself. So each thought and changer of thought is part of the thought itself which is a by-product of the nervous system. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE To experience the Quantum level, one must go into the Nonverbal I AM, the silence and Beyond. With all of this in mind, in the Appendix of The Tao of Chaos, "I" wrote an article called "On Compassion" where I spoke about possible "stages" within the biological dimension. The first stage is the "grounding" in one's body, the second stage, the realization of the body being made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE as everything else. It should be noted that the body is ultimately not a vehicle of the soul. As will be discussed later, the body-soul are one and are made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.
