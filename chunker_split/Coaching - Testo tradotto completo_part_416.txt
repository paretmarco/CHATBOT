As for the (second) level we are busy describing now, there can no longer be emotion, and there is an extensive increase in one’s attention. What is essentially witnessed at this level is a sharpened self-control, and control over the surrounding environment. The average man sometimes gets into this state in situations characterized by extreme levels of danger or risk, being situations where he has to lean on the entire range of his strengths so as “transcend his own self”, and achieve “the impossible”102. The hub of this higher level of functioning lies in the fact that, whereas simple fascination might even be achieved merely through emotion and the desire to actualize the intended result, this higher form of fascination can only be reached via an absolute self-mastery 103. This is a very Yang technique 104. The fundamental aspect is the double level of consciousness, the first such level being directed at one's immediate sensory nature, and the second one being orientated so as to face the action which is being undertaken.
