Now, let us go back to our light-prism-rainbow metaphor and substitute the light with the NOTHINGNESS, and the prism with superstrings as the medium to form the Physics Dimensions. We could then say that the light was the NOTHING, superstring was the prism (medium contraction) and the rainbow the Physics dimensions. Therefore, it could be said that what we call archetypes and ultimately "a personal me" or "a personal you," is actually a manifestation or a combination of the physics dimensions and forces (the rainbow) which are, ultimately, made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE or NOTHINGNESS. In this way, you could say that the "you" "you" call "yourself," is a combination of interactions of the Physics dimensions and forces. Again, going back to our earlier metaphor of the prism (superstrings) and the physics dimensions (rainbow), we could say, metaphorically, we are a rainbow made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, which in appearance only imagines itself to be made of different substances. THE PLAY (INTERACTIONS) OF THE DIMENSIONS This idea of a "play" or interaction of the dimensions and forces is not new.
