The industrial revolution made technology our god and ownership of possessions our demi-god. Even in modern society the idea of discovering WHO YOU ARE is now confused with what you do or have. The sickness of our society was the giving-up of our connection to humanity for technological advances. This was deemed progress and healthy. And the individual that could not fit in or cope was unhealthy. It could be said that people no longer had the time or energy to explore the question of "Who Am IT' The assembly line increased productivity and "progress" but the price was high. Stress escalated and anxiety rose to new heights as we were taken out of our natural environment and placed in an industrial complex—in a sense, an anti-human situation. It could be said that, as technology and industry grew and became dehumanized, so did psychology as we presently know it. In fact, we can easily see the correlation. When I embarked on "my" journey in the late 1960s, psychology still had a shred of light—people in search of themselves. But when "I" returned from India in 1982 the field had become an industry.
