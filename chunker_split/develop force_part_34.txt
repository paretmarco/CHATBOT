The experience can be done with the same process in backward conditions; namely, passing you set one person at a window. Two action elements come into the scene in this series of experiences: the magnetic power of gaze and the concentration of thought. When these experiences have succeeded once on two, you have conscience that you can dominate others and impose your will in large measure. Other experiments you can then try with the help of a friend or an ordinary person. Suppose that you want to obtain from him a service or an object from which he does not want to part from. You will focus your thoughts on the idea that he must deliver this object, without having him to suspect what action you want to exercise. You will place yourself in front of him talking about the satisfaction you would feel if you had the object even only for a few minutes, you stare to the subject of the experiment with sweetness and persistence, like to let his brain absorb the idea of handing over the object. If the penetration of the gaze is sufficiently developed, and if thought concentration is quite large, you will quickly notice that every word has, on the subject, a physical effect that goes straight to the point you want to reach. The interlocutor, who does not take long to be more or less completely subjugated, abdicates the throne and ends up giving the object that you want. Here there is evidently a beginning of hypnotizing. Until you hold someone under your eyes, you greatly diminish more and more the strength of his judgment and his will.
