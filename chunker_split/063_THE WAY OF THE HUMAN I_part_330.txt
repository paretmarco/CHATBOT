Notice, however, that under stress when you are dealing with your own children, you sound just like your parents. Living so close to Santa Fe, New Mexico, I often jokingly say in workshops that if this is your experience, you are channeling your parents. To explain further, inherent within parents is the idea that if they want the child to agree with them, they should intensify their stance to get the child to succumb. In this way, the child will go along with them and play their game. Around 1975, "I" as a client had a particularly powerful therapy session. I was working with a woman who did a combination of Gestalt and Reichian therapy. Her sessions lasted several hours and in one, I got to the emotional place where I realized that, in order to survive, I had to play my father's game. The pain of this recognition was so overwhelming that I felt shattered. As time passed, however, the integration of this work freed me deeply at the level of individuality and broke open a major identity with my father but of which I had been unknowingly living.
