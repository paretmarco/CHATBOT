The central point Using a pen, draw a small black dot at the base of your nose which is situated between the eyelashes, whereafter you should place yourselves in front of a mirror, comfortably seated, and intensely fix your gaze on that point for growingly longer time periods. Exercise 13. The oblique mirror Turn your right shoulder in the direction of the mirror and, as you keep your head straight ahead of you in a motionless state, you must then attempt, by turning the eyes, to meet your own look. If you fail to bring that about, turn your head as little as possible, until you have managed to meet your look. At that point, you should stare at your eyes intensely for progressively more extended time spans. Repeat the exercise by your left side. Lift the mirror or sit in a low position, so that, for you to meet your own look, you will be required to lift up your eyes as high as you can.
