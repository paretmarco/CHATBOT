Normal phases in a Non Verbal Technique Seance are: 1) REP (positive empathic rapport) 2) Introduction of analog elements (elements creating emotional tension) 3) Introduction of symbolic elements (these elements break the old schemas) 4) Analog tests (optional; consist in non verbal suggestions) 5) Passing test (optional: show us if the subject is ready for the intervention) 6) intervention (multisensory hypnotherapy) MULTISENSORY HYPNOTHERAPY It is very simple and depends on the efficacity of the preceding induction; you use words to suggests some images that bring in the direction you want. You don't need to be logic; you need just that what you do be very integrated in a whole idea suggesting the change. Very useful is speaking directly to the subconscious as it were a separate identity. Very useful is too the use of symbolic elements during the hypnotherapeutic phase.

MULTISENSORY HYPNOSIS AND ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY Ericksonian hypnotherapy involves the use of complex phrases and expressions; through the correct use of the non verbal communication, you can get the client very involved in what you say and each word you use will have a stronger emphasis.
