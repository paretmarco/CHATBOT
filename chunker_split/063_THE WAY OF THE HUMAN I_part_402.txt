In short, a personification comes from the unconscious or conscious mind of an individual whereas an archetype is formed by the direct condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which fauns the COLLECTIVE (see Volume III, The Archetypes of the Collective). The mind as a unified whole is symbolically represented by the ocean. In Buddhism, for example, there are specific Mudras (hand positions) which the Buddha is depicted in. Each hand position depicts a different understanding. For example, the most famous position of Buddha sitting touching (tapping) the earth represents Buddha's acknowledgment of the earth as the witness to his enlightenment. This Mudra depicts the earth as the impartial witness to all of our thoughts, feelings, emotions and actions. I personally have in my house a Buddha statue where Buddha's hand position depicts the calming of the ocean (or the mind). Poseidon is a personification of the Greek God of the ocean or mind and he gives a beautiful Bull (representative of sexual energy and fertility) to King Minos (a King can be representative of the higher self).
