In this developmental sequence, the survival trance begins when children realize that they are separate and independent from their mother or father. This creation of an individual self is a crucial period. It is also a time for the development of a dissociative observer which is formed to defend against the loss of self in relationship to the world or to defend against the body's biological needs not being met. Identities begin to emerge to interact with the world and other people, hiding our deep feelings of total separateness. This dissociative observer might be a major reason for feeling apart from humanity. Since the trance of survival is so powerful, the dissociative observer feels both separate and special, often feeling more spiritual or more grandiose (since they are not connected to their bodies, hence losing the world [the trance of spiritualization will be discussed in greater detail later]). For example, I spoke to a woman in New York who wanted to be a guru and whose heart was broken in a relationship several years ago.
