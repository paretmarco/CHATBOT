The "delayed grief" apropos of these losses manifests itself in a set of symptoms which have been called the "adult child syndrome". Dr. Wolinsky shows clearly that since we created the defending trances, we can change them once we are aware of how we're continuing to create them. What I have called reclaiming the inner child is a way to dehypnotize oneself. By imagining ourselves embracing our vulnerability in the form of a little child, our adult self takes charge of a trance that originally protected us, but now limits us. What I called championing the child is a way to live in the present moment, by consciously changing the ways we have been rejecting our own childhood feelings, needs, and wants. In The Dark Side of the Inner Child, Wolinsky offers us a x variety of ways to become aware of how we are creating the defensive trances that constitute the frozen states of the inner child. I have stressed the essential role of one' s adult self in reintegrat- ing the experiences of the past. Wolinsky speaks of the "witnessing self." The adult in my model and the witnessing self are roughly equivalent.
