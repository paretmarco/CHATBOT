Exit peripherals Trances We often move eyes in various positions and without realizing it we enter into a trance. The phenomenon has been observed in PNL. The following exercise is useful to minimize this type of "trance." Infinity 1 Here is an exercise that seems easy, but it is very difficult to perform correctly. It is about tracking mentally without discontinuity and for a time growing the mathematical sign for infinity, similar to an 8 lying down. You can do it in the country or in open spaces.

This simple exercise helps the inter-hemispheric coordination as well as it makes it more difficult to lose your presence at certain times. Infinity 2 Observed a point in front of you and then executed movements as a lying eight (?) with the head, so that your pupils are obliged to perform this movement while always looking the point. Try to be always attentive to the point. This exercise develops attention a lot.
