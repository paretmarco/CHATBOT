We often observe that the same page of a financial newspaper includes, side-by-side, two different articles devoted to technical analysis, one of which uses a strategy or puts forward a viewpoint that is being advanced by those who see the market long (bullish), and the other typical of those who see it short (bearish). Traders are in the habit of employing such verbalizations as: “The market is due for a rise; it must first ensure; it must continue to; sooner or later it will have to; it just cannot go on like this, etc”. This happens when one establishes a connection with the market which is grounded on one point of view only, whereupon, on the strength of his subjective beliefs and convictions, he communicate with other people, and often even with his own self, by making use of the abovementioned vocabulary.
