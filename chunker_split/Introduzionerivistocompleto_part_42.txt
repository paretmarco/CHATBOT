The right hemisphere is the creative one, that of imaginative thought where dreams are developed and musical information is found. Think about musicians and painters, they are all people who have a more developed right hemisphere. The left hemisphere is specialized in rational thought, in logic and in language. These two parts of the brain communicate with each other via the corpus callosum, which mediates messages. SELF-HYPNOSIS and hypnosis, do nothing other than allow the right hemisphere to activate itself. We obviously use the left hemisphere more for everyday tasks and this is an obstacle to the activation of the right one, for the former evaluates and examines information that arrives via our senses, meaning images, sounds and sensations. To reach the right hemisphere, we need to distract the left using verbal commands or other techniques until whatever flows from the right hemisphere is not subjected to judgment. In hypnosis induced by others, the left hemisphere is deactivated by the hypnotist through the use of specific techniques. In SELF-HYPNOSIS, we are responsible for this operation. As you would have realized, we remain the protagonists in this experience, whether we are induced or there is auto-inducement. It is here that the importance of visualization arises: Create a clear image of the things that you want and before anything else, instill it with emotions. Just think that inventors are able to see the object they are inventing before they have even put together the parts.
