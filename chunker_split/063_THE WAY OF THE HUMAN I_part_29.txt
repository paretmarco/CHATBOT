In an introductory workshop I did in Seattle, much to the chagrin of some of the participants, I suggested that (contrary to what many seminar leaders insist and present in their training), you cannot get everything you want. I suggested that you can have what you want, given your personal limitations like IQ, talents, the external context and abilities. For example, if you were born with no vocal cords, no matter how much you want to be a professional singer, you probably won't be able to make it as one.' If your IQ is low, the probability is that you won't become a nuclear scientist, no matter how much you want to be one. In the movie, Chariots of Fire, Harold Abrahams (one of the runners) is told by his trainer, "There's an old expression in this business, you can't put in what God left out!" In the same way, don't be bummed-out reading this. Rather, the work is simple: to study and go beyond who you "think," "feel," etc. you are.
