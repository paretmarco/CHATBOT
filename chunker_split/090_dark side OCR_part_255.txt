The task becomes one of awakening the observer so that the inner child identity can be observed and dismantled. Resources can then become available and the trance or the inner child (automatic reaction) lessens. When a client comes to me as a therapist, each word of description lets me know how she creates her internal experience. My attitude is, "Teach me how the inner child creates your prob- lem." By listening to her words, and changing the meaning of the words, she can alter the groove in the record so that the song plays with a different tune. Let's say you give me limited associations with particular words. I expand on each of them. For example, in "all men are untrustworthy," untrustworthy is the limited meaning fused with "men." Changing this offers an opportunity to experi- ence new meanings for "men," thus yielding new perspectives on how to see men. In order to do this, the inner child within the adult must be seen for what it is, an identity created by the observer during trauma and chaos. This shifts how it views the world.
