To handle that, the little girl fogged out her parents drinking so she did not have to experience what was occurring. By having her hold eye contact with me in the therapeutic process, she went into the little girl within the adult who had fogged out to survive. What "popped up " was the memory of her parents drinking ( the other side of the inner child). As will be discussed later, the processes by which I got her to stop fogging out de- hypnotized her, so in her life she no longer fogged out automatically, and was no longer in denial about her parents drinking. The glue which held the drinking was the trance I call "blocking out," or not seeing what is there. I began to stop the blocking by suggesting that the child within see transparency, opaqueness, translucency, colors in the fog. (See "Blocking Out" Chapter 8.) Since the dark side of the inner child could no longer follow the path of blocking out as part of her "frozen pattern," she could no longer continue the child-like drinking trance in present time.
