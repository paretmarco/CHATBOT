When we are able to express without words phrases such "sleep", "relax", "is not important that your conscious mind hear, the important is that your subconsciuous mind understand" or "is important that you have a sincere subconscious movement" or other, we come surely to a better understanding of what hypnosis really is. It is fundamental to be able to understand what is the logic standing behind the words of the ericksonian inductions, or of the "Elmanlike" induction or any other possible induction. Using certain gestures (non verbal communication), we can put animals in a trance. The principle behind is valid for human persons, too. Normally, to hypnotize animals, we have to catch and block them, and after we use passes, or gaze, to hold their attention in a certain direction. For instance, to hypnotize a chicken, we have to force the hen's head flat to the ground, and to draw a line directly out from its beak. The animal will stay staring at this line; to hypnotize a guinea pig we have to roll the animal over and over some time on the table, and then lay it on its back. And the guinea pig will remain quiescent. We can suppose that these way of acting break some of the normal schemas of reacting of these animals and in some way suggest them to mantain their position without moving. There are strong analogies with the multisensory method of hypnosis.
