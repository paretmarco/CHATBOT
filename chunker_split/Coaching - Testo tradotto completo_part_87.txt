The exercise we are now going to describe addresses your unconscious mind and re-establishes an energy-related balance. Whenever you become aware of an emotion or a small tic, you should motion a bit with your hand, which is held open towards the body almost as if to brush it (such small movements are termed “steps”). This motion should be directed downwardly, as though it was sweeping emotionalism away. As you carry out that motion, you should keep your attention focused on the sensation which is established between your body and the palm of the hand. These steps have the effect of bringing about an energy balance. You should additionally take some circular “steps” over your belly. The key of stress, anxiety and tension is in fact situated in that area. It is here, indeed, that we find a true second brain, tasked with important functions which cast a reflection over the entire organism. It is an area characterized by a high density of nervous fibres.
