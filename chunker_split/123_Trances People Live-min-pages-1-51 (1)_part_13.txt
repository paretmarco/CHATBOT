Driving along in the car, I hear a tune from 20 years ago and spontaneously age regress to a particular experience that is linked in my memory with that tune. Or, I am sitting in my favorite chair absorbed in a basketball game on TV and somehow manage not to hear a word that is said to me by my wife. Or, I look up from my desk where I have been hard at work for the past hour and glance outside, staring into the sky and the trees in a daydreamy, absorbing moment. These examples of Erickson's common everyday trance invol ye a non-symptomatic and transitory use of Deep Trance Phenomena. In addition to these kinds of light trance states that Erickson described and utilized in his work are trance states that function at the core of the symptom structure. As we will see in Chapter 2, these kinds of trances are created by the child in response to threat and become sources of pathology as they are integrated into the child's habitual mode of response. By the time we reach adulthood, we have intricate patterns of defense woven out of clusters of Deep Trance Phenomena that appear to function autonomously within us.
