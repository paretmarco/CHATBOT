Simply stated, she attempted to fog out her father, and when that did not work, she fogged out herself in an attempt to become invisible. When she came to me in therapy, she told me that when she looked in the mirror, she could not see her body. It was fogged out! I have seen this in many cases of child abuse where there is an attempt to be invisible and fog out one's body. The child cannot make the perpetrator invisible, so he freezes himself, making his body invis- ible. Therapeutic Approach My strategy is to ask clients to look at me, which interrupts their child trance and starts a present time experience. As they look at me, they don't feel lonely. There is no blocking-out occurring with me. If she is connecting with me, and really connects, how could she experience loneliness? In present time, we are just here. If she blocks me out and goes into her child trance, she experiences loneliness because she is her inner child, which is not in present time but in past time.
