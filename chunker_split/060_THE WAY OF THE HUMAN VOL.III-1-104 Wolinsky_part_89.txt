The search which serves to fulfill Einstein's dream of "a theory of everything." Quantum Psychology is not saying Superstring Theory is correct, since whether the concept is correct or not does not directly matter to Quantum Psychology. What does matter is that superstrings include all forces and Physics Dimensions. Thus, it includes not only all Archetypes and all "you" call "you," but it actually provides a process to go beyond. Whether Superstring theory is right or wrong, the forces of the Physics Dimensions (energy, space, mass, time, grav ity, etc.) are here to stay. In this way, the Physics Dimensions and its 84 Chapter III forces might be included as a major piece in Quantum Psychology's theory of everything In Quantum Psychology workshops much time is spent dismantling concepts, the most critical being energy, space, mass and time. Why? Because according to David Bohm nothing could exist in the physical universe if it did not contain these four dimensions. Taking Bohm a bit further, we can see that there are other physics dimensions and forces.
