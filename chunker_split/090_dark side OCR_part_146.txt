In the Woody Allen film, Annie Hall, two characters have a conversation on the balcony. The conversation is about philosophy. Subtitles are added to the film, telling you what is being said behind Illusioning + 89 the words. In illusioning, however, the subtitles are seen, even when they are not present. The child within mind reads them and acts as if they were there and real in present time. Mind Reading "When you mind read you make snap judgements about others... There's no evidence but it just seems right. In most instances, mind readers make assumptions about how other people are feeling and what motivates them... As a mind reader, you also make assumptions about how people are reacting to things around them, particularly how they are reacting to you.... Mind reading depends on a process of projection. You imagine that people feel the same way you do and react to things the same way you do. Therefore you don't watch or listen closely enough to notice that they are actually different." (Mckay, 1981:20) For example, a sexually-abusive father might talk about the Boy Scouts with his son, but the child knows his father wants sex.
