The ocular greeting: An extremely forceful tool, if you wish to lend power to the first moment of your meeting, is to think of something and establish within yourselves a particular state of being, a specific inner mood prior to walking into the presence of your interlocutor. A very effective method consists in giving birth, within yourselves, to the kind of attitude you would have during a chance encounter with a dear friend you happen to see again after a long interval. When the time comes, therefore, to get into the presence of people you are scheduled to meet, what is going to happen is that your eyes shall engage, without any conscious effort on your part, in what is termed “flash” or “ocular” greeting 97. When, in fact, we meet a person we had not previously come to know, it might happen that, unwittingly and unexpectedly, we raise our eyebrows for a very brief moment. That is something which, conversely, does not happen if the person in question is known to us in advance. It is after all an extremely rapid movement which is very hard to reproduce by mere gestures.
