The Fascination Method of Donato Franz Anton Mesmer Toward the end of the 1700 the Austrian Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), discovered the genus of a science which had already been perceived by Maxwell in 1673, by Paracelsus in the sixteenth century, and by Van Helmont in 1630. He studied and presented it to the public under the name of animal magnetism. Mesmer claimed that men could exercise over each other a beneficent influence by means of a fluid which is universally distributed and which insinuates itself in the substance of the nerves, and transmits itself by contact or by passes or movements of the hands at a distance. This fluid was a harmonic fluid, and Mesmer spoke of a balance between the universe and man. Mesmer used his hands and also the power of the eyes that he steadily fixed on his patients while doing magnetic strokes on the arms and touching the epigastrium in some specific way. Mesmer had undergone himself also a series of inner exercises in order to increase his power. We don't know the exact sequence, but we know that one of the most notable was trying to stop the interior dialogue.
