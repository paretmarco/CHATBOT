An uncooked seed which remains unacknowledged has the potential to sprout as soon as the external dimension or context changes. Quantum Psychology suggests utilizing awareness and dismantling your uncooked seeds so that they no longer sprout and grab your awareness and pull you out of ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc. The #1 uncooked seed of your psychology is the False Core-False Self because it drives the entire machinery of what you call the individual Mind. You cannot meditate your False Core-False Self away. You cannot mantra your False Core-False Self away. You have to be willing to look at and acknowledge everything that is there. Without dismantling the False Core-False Self which drives "your" psychology, "you" can never stabilize in ESSENCE, I AM, etc. THROUGH THE FALSE CORE DRIVER-FALSE SELF COMPENSATOR LENS Let's look at this through the eyes of different False Core Drivers and False Self Compensators. Let's say at age five, a child is molested: One False Core would say, "There's something wrong with me, that's the reason this happened." Another False Core would say "I'm worthless, even Uncle Henry is treating me as if I'm worthless."
