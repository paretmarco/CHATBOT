130 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child Adult Problem State: Years later in relationships, the inner child within the adult idealizes her spouse. This prevents the present time adult from seeing her spouse in present time. Sometimes the inner child will idealize to the degree of only seeing, or falling in love with, the potential or imagined ideal of the spouse. In other words the child within the adult uses the trance with the spouse that worked with the parents. Illusioning, fantasizing or blocking out might be used. Unfortunately for the present time adult, they are unaware of these trances, while the observer remains fast asleep. In another scenario, the inner child within the adult makes his spouse into an ideal by "building her up," making the spouse feel good about herself. In this case, the child within believes, "If I build you up, you'll take care of me." To be taken care of is a normal wish. Unfortunately, in a dysfunctional family, this is a desperate wish because care and love are unavailable. Adult Problem State: Idealizing other people, lessening yourself in order to idealize others.
