The aforesaid does not mean the trader has to be cold. It simply denotes that he ought to be Free from the danger of his own subconscious reactions dictating matters. 3. Understanding and being connected to his objectives: The trading which produces the best results is founded upon targeted goals. Being FOCUSED is thus a necessary prerequisite. 4. Intuition and Lateral Thinking: We refer, by this term, to that ability possessed by our mind which enables us to avoid the trap of using only our logical side, in favour of a more comprehensive way which encompasses the capacity to grab and develop opportunities as well. 5. Intuitive acumen: It is a specific aspect of intuition, which will be elaborated upon in the course of the last chapter of the book. This aspect is closely linked to having the courage to gain access to one’s own inner resources. In a global market, it is the best operators who drive forward and progress. In the world of trading, we can see in action an even more intensified version of PARETO’s famous law, which states that 20% of all operations actually yield an 80% of actualized gains.
