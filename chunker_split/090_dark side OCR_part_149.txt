Acknowledge the illusioning as the inner child. 2. Identify which style of illusioning is occurring. 1. Selective trancing 2. Awfulizing 3. Wonderfulizing 4. Mind-reading 3. Call out. Each time the illusioning occurs, internally call out its Illusioning â€¢ 91 name. For example, if you find the inner child is making everything awful (awfulizing), internally call out that pro- cess by name, pointing internally to it. Say to yourself, that's awfulizing. 4. Vary.

Another way of dismantling illusioning is to move the images around, to see them smaller, bigger and then in different parts of the room.
