Everything is ultimately traced back to an issue of time: Learning a language, as well as succeeding in a business deal or in discovering something. The only Magical Formula: Knowing how to use Time well + Vital Energy = Doing and achieving ANYTHING we wish Time and consciousness are interconnected. Chronological time is in fact the same for all and sundry. It is the consciousness one has of such time that changes from person to person. As regards some people, a day is nothing more than a repetition of habits. For others, it is a great adventure in which every moment counts. In order to have more time, we must be present to life and to its wonder, to be conscious of what we do. We must, lastly, operate in each one of the different dimensions of time: In absolute time, the time of intuition and opportunities; and in linear time, which is the time of planning. The one who, at all times, limits himself to planning, or the one who, invariably, merely lives life as it comes, is only capable of exploiting some of the gifts which life extends to him.
