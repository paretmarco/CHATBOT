Everything you know about yourself came from outside of you—therefore, discard it. 5. Hold on to the I AM—let go of everything else. 6. The only way to find out who you are is to find out who you are not. 7. To let go of something, you must first know what it is. 8. The experiences is contained within the experience itself. 9. Anything you know about you cannot be. According to Quantum Psychology, this was a lot to ask in a Western culture. Following Nisargadatta's principles, Quantum Psychology found that if you dismantle enough of your False Core-False Self, the I AM which is pure being beyond ESSENCE is revealed. The I AM stands between the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and ESSENCE. I AM ERRORS Some people think that Nisargadatta Maharaj's I AM is a construct. I continually meet people who believe that you can create I AM as a primary experience. The NON-VERBAL I AM is beyond and prior to the label I AM. The NON-VERBAL I AM has no qualities, it is prior to description or label and is actually unnamable.
