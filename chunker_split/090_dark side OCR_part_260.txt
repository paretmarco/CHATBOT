I am already experiencing anxiety and tightness in my muscles. The policeman is the trigger. This trance is triggered by police and is from the past experience of having five policeman beat me up in the 1960s during an anti- Vietnam war demonstration. The stuck part of myself overlays the incident of the 1960s on the 1990s and, thus, creates a catastrophizing and fear trance. In my case, as with the others, there was no differentiation. I asked this man, "What exactly is the trigger?" He said, "Well, she hugs me. When she sees me she goes like this: she taps me on the back or puts an arm around me. I can tell that it' s becoming more of a friendly relationship than a lover relationship." The hand and touch are what triggers the response. To him that says she is being friendly rather than sexual. My task is to differentiate the trigger (to make into smaller pieces). I asked, "Which finger feels most friendly?" He said, "The middle finger." The trigger is the way she touches him.
