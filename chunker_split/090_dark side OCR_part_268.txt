So I chose to receive and acknowledge the message called pain, i.e., "I have a toothache," was received and acknowledged, and I agreed to go to the dentist the following day. The agreement, "I got the message, take care of the message (the pain) and allow myself some sleep." This is a self-to-self trance in present time utilizing anesthesia, which maintains the emotional health of the individual. Ways of Creating Anesthesia 1. Symbols: Ask yourself for a symbol (mountain, river, tiger, etc.) that might help you with the pain. Place the symbol into the physical body. I once saw a client with a headache who created the symbol of Richard Nixon' s head as his own head during a migraine. He smiled as Nixon had the pain, not him. 2. Differentiation: In any differentiation work, it can be first noted that pain is experienced as a block or undifferentiated mass. I divide the pain by asking the client or myself to describe it. (You can ask yourself, for example, if the pain is sharp.)
