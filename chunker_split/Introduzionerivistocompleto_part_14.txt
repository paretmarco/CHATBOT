For example, you have definitely once met a person and, not knowing anything about him, have made comments such as: “He is nice; I can feel it in my bones” or “Even though I’ve just met him, we get on well”. This happens when the rapport is triggered spontaneously, therefore, we have two people who unconsciously move their bodies in the same way, have the same gestures, walk alike, which in NLP terms takes the name of “Mirroring” a method that you use when you want to create a rapport. Mirroring is one of the simplest methods and, at the same time, the starting point to putting ourselves on the same level as our interlocutor so as to enter into a positive relationship with him/ her. Not everyone has a personality or mind open enough to immediately enter into harmony with an unknown, maybe because of past experiences or a present state of mind. Therefore, it sometimes takes a long time to accept a calm dialogue with another person. We can, therefore, decide to shorten this time using the mirroring technique and create a positive, emphatic rapport. “It is important to enter into the other’s world, if we want to bring him into ours!!!! !” When you establish that special understanding between two people, one of them will unconsciously and more easily respond in a positive way to the other’s stimulation.
