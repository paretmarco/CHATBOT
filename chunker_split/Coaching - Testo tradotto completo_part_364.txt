Thereupon, once the data or constituent elements of the problem occasioned by the circumstances are properly present to the spirit, it will become necessary (while taking care to still maintain one's attention to this mental picture) to turn towards another, vaster plane within our own selves, as if we were opening ourselves up to the infinite, and to follow such self-orientation by inwardly articulating our firm resolution to obtain a reply. The most effective form of such inward formulation would be an open-ended one, but that does not detract from the fact that a closed form, too, might be able to create a stimulation: «I must find a way of getting to the heart of this whole matter» — or even better: «I attract to my person the inspirations which can benefit me in this specific connection» — «I want to acquire a clear idea of what I am required to do in this regard», «I wonder how many different creative methods I might resort to in order to be capable of solving such a situation”, or indeed any other form which is essentially identical to the ones we have listed above.
