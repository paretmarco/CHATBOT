Sometimes, nothing is worse, in an effort to construct a hallucination, than the scenario where the underlying impulse of it is a prior achievement of success which had made us very proud. The mechanism is in essence the following: We engage in something whereby we achieve success; we then repeat it, once more successfully. We then infer that we will always experience success. If, as we engage in trading, we manage to obtain some gratifications through the pursuit of a certain line of conduct (and that especially during the early stages of that activity), such as carrying out operations which prove to be winners and fetch us good sums of money, we will in fact build a generalization to the effect that such behaviour will always and invariably occasion a satisfactory outcome. As soon, however, as the first inconveniences manifest, problems begin to arise. The truth is in fact that the earlier experiences caused us to feel pride, they have given us an ennobling sense of accomplishment, and yet, now, the selfsame conduct fails to work for us.
