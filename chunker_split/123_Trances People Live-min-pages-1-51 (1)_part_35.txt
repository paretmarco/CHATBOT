The point is that even when Erickson was focusing on evoking unc onscious. change, content issues were still involved: he meant that the necessary•insights and understandings could be grasped on an unconscious level. So he was still concerning himself with content to some extent; what•varied was the level of consciousness at which the content was appre- iscussing the two kinds of therapeutic work, conscious and itilenicidc(nndsdce ious, Erickson and Rossi ( 1979) explain that first, the patient is introduced to the "difference between the conscious and unconscious mind." Once that is achieved, Erickson will continue to explore on both levels, leaving change on an unconscious level if the patient is willing, or bringing it into conscious awareness if that seems more beneficial: The activated. . .associations may remain at an unconscious level, where during trance they are turned over to effect an apparently autonomous resolution of the patient's prob- lem. It is possible that hypnotherapy can take place entirely at an unconscious level without the patient (and sometimes even the therapist) knowing the "why" of the cure. The patient only knows a problem has been resolved.
