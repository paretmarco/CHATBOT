The eye lying on the median point between sun and moon might bring to mind the importance of a higher vision and the possibility of attaining thereby a superior vision. A concept which is shared by plentiful traditions is “the reawakening by the third eye”, which signifies an opening that gradually leads to an amplification of consciousness. A link might be established between such phenomenology and factors which are both physiological and purely connected to percepton. A French researcher, Dr. Lefebure [17], used to observe the fact that this central point of the “third eye” corresponded to a certain physiological position where the normal three-dimensional vision was suspended. In theory, we could then simultaneously discern an object placed on that point from every side. Dr. Lefebure’s hypothesis was that such a suspension of the ordinary mode of perception might have a significant impact on the brain, by steering it “beyond space”. According to many traditions, such a third eye is also portrayed as being contained inside a triangle which functions as a symbol of fire as well. Fire is in fact the element endowed with the highest level of vibration [18].
