Exercise 9 The needle of the watch Place in front of your self, no more than 40 centimetres away, your pocket watch, and then begin to fix your look on the needle that indicates the seconds, following its head as it rotates clockwise, without your sight letting go of it. By means of this exercise, you will become capable of maintaining automatic control over the increasing resistance of your look. Exercise 10. The wall Sit comfortably in the middle of a room in such a way that you are freely capable of observing the four corners of the wall in front of you. Once that preliminary step has been taken (and while you unerringly keep your self still), you must then begin to stare for a minute at the top left corner. You follow that up by staring at the top right corner, whereafter, once more for the duration of one minute in each instance, you should fix your look on the bottom right corner and the bottom left corner respectively. This exercise, too, which avails a far-reaching extension of the shape of the eyes and the strengthening of the orbicular muscles of the eye, must be progressively stretched time-wise. Exercise 11.
