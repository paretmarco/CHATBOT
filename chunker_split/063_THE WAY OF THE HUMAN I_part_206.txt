Needs originate from biological deprivation; obsessive-compulsive wants which never feel like enough occur are when you substitute a biological need with a psychological want, which later becomes a "desire for" with an obsessive-compulsive action. For example, Biological Need: I want to merge (this is not met)â€”psychological want (I have to get approval). 'Recently a guru wannabe said to me that "sex is a trance." It should be noted that sexuality is wired into the nervous system as a survival of the species. 126 Chapter VIII This is substituting a psychological want (approval) for the biological need (merging). This imagined way to merger by substituting (the biological need) for a psychological wants (approval) gets ingrained and even though it yields no satisfaction, the tendency becomes engraved on the brain like a groove on a record. The biological need conies before the psychological want. This substitution process is a survival technique by the body (nervous system) to survive and get biological needs met. In Buddhism, Buddha says, "All pain arises from desire."
