The cardinal rule for being able to derive from our method the whole profit one can expect from it is the rule of identifying, of concretely embodying as much as possible. Every point must suggest to us some concrete thing to do or to refrain from doing, some usual action which stands in need of correction, in such a way that life might turn into a voluntary work, one when man, instead of drifting around aimlessly and going astray, sets his sight on a specific goal, and accordingly directs his every effort towards it, taking advantage in the process of whatever might prove useful, while eschewing every thing which might accrue to his detriment. Each one of these frames, as it adapts to individual requirements, must necessarily expand and deepen in such a way that nothing is going to elude oneâ€™s investigation. In fact, even a most tiny point which is ordinarily neglected might one day become most useful, with the result that the earlier overlooking of it would be shown to have been extremely noxious. Practical formulation of the daily plan Having gathered all the necessary elements, we will now turn our attention to the issue of how one goes about formulating his daily plan.
