For example, if a child is not allowed to show affection, the observer might disconnect the child from that particular feeling. Years later, the inner child may experience a disconnection-from- intimacy trance. If a child is not allowed to get angry, the observer disconnects the child from that feeling. Years later, the angry part erupts from the frozen child, but when asked, "Are you angry," the person replies from the adult' s point of view, "Who me, angry? Of course not. I never get angry." The adult experience is that he never gets angry. It is some disconnected part that gets angry and, if he could get rid of it, everything would be fine. 2. Disappearing In a dysfunctional family a child might leave, or disappear, and experience his or her self as "not here." To protect a child of alcoholic parents the observer either inwardly or outwardly makes the child feel like he disappears and, hence, the child feels invisible. This disappearing trance can create huge problems in relation- ships, particularly in the area of intimacy.
