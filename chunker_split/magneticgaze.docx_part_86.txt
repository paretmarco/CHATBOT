The Japanese “koan” is a statement, often bearing a paradoxical meaning, to which the mind seeks to provide an intelligible connotation, e.g. “what is the sound produced by a single clapping hand?”. Reflecting over the paradox, in fact, makes the conscious mind weary. The effect of the “mantra” is analogous. The “mantra” is a constantly repeated word. Here, too, a similar phenomenon involving the weariness of some cerebral mechanisms is produced. In the instances described above, the koan or the mantra is utilized as single point of the contemplative «focus». Step by step, this type of concentration turns into an automatic process. The moment the mind concentrates, we can reach a specific instant in which our mind “releases itself”, whereupon we experience a “collapse on the part of the previous system of thoughts”, or possibly even a “moment of deep change”. When that point is reached, the mind is ready for a spontaneous experience of accomplishment, that is, it is ready to perceive non-duality.
