For example, when we feel a lack of love (merger), rather than experiencing that, we eat or have sex. Often, status symbols like big houses or cars are attempts to relieve pain for feeling a lack of self-worth. This is how desires escalate and get distorted Understanding that desires are often a way to resist unfelt experiences gives Buddha's Noble Truth, "Be desireless," a new meaning: Instead of trying to be desireless, don't resist, allow yourself to experience what is driving the desire rather than the substituted idea or image of what will satisfy the desire. As the practice begins to deepen, people often develop a nonjudgmental approach toward exploring their desires as opposed to trying to get rid of them, overcome them, deny them, or transform them. Instead, they see them as made of energy. 194 Focus: Focus your attention on the energy of desire rather than on the object being desired. (Singh) Practice: Let your eyes close. Allow an object of extreme desire to come into your mind. Imagine it is out in front of you. It could be a person, a situation, or anything- that you want.
