Remember to stop sometimes in your movements Use also the principles of the four steps therapy: - Concentration of the mind - Hypnosis - Solutions - Amplifying solutions GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING.
