By way of mirroring, we send back to the interlocutor, with our behavior, the same way of behaving that belongs to his/ her pattern of the world. You become a mirror of the other, for example: legs crossed during a conversation, fingers of one hand entwined with the other. This is carried out until you arrive at the same tone of voice and level of breathing, which are two of the most powerful mirrors. It is enough to think of a baby that sleeps in the arms of its mother because her breathing makes it feel safe. All this is perceived by the unconscious of our interlocutor as similarity and/ or affinity. It is amazing how “brick walls” can be brought down if we learn to listen, observe and feel others. Mirroring means entering into harmony with respect and delicacy without invading or annoying. This method has the advantage of creating a rapport, without necessarily knowing the way which the individual lives his/ her life or sharing it. To have this ability can, for example, positively affect a clinical interview, a school test, a sale or a simple discussion. Some examples of things to mirror are: Posture: Is it tense or relaxed? Is the body leaning forwards or backwards? How are the hands, arms and legs placed? Breathing: Is his/ her breathing thoracic or abdominal? Is the rhythm slow, quick or calm? With what intensity is s/he breathing (Deep or shallow)? Movements: What are his/ her gestures? What does s/he do with the hands?
