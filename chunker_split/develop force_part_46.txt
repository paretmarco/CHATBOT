Restore "sub-sensorialties" We call "sub-sensorialty" a series of outermost sensorial responses that normally we do not realize, and happen below the level of our consciousness (subliminal). To be increasingly present they must be reintegrated. Integrate sub-sensorialties is the key to increase oneself sensitivity. We have: At physical level sensations of magnetism At visual level the so-called "auras" At auditory level "sub sounds" The following exercises can help integrate these sub-sensorialties BODY Magnetic sensations Move a finger towards the palm of your hand. Even without touching, the palm will feel a tingling sensation; move away the finger, and notice how there may be a remaining feeling. After this preliminary exercise, work out every day to bring energy to your "hara" (your navel) through the “magnetic steps”. VIEW The Aura Exercise 22 –focus on the mirror In front of a mirror performs the following steps: With an uninterrupted light not too strong, breathe slowly and look at your face in a mirror. It is ideal to do this when you are a little tired, but not too much. Keep yourself in a relaxed status and focus on the center point, an eye or your forehead. In a short time, you will feel heat in the back of the neck. At this point, continue to focus. This heat is your energy. Now you can imagine to be opening a door.
