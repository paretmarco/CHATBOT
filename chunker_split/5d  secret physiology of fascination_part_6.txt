FIXATION OF ATTENTION and Blurring As we walk, drive a car , or fly low over the terrain , our accommodation is determined largely by Gibson's (1950) well-known "texture gradient." The retin a unconsciously performs some kind of a product-moment averaging routine on the textural elements t o reduce the blur, and the fact that much of the scene necessarily remains blurred normally goes unnoticed so long as the acuity demand remains low. But as we point in a specific direction blurring appears in the peripheral field CIRCULATION AND EXPANSION IN THE UNIVERSE Peripheral Circular Movements Circular movements seem to have a specific exciting effect on the eyes. They can prepare the real fascination work. It is to observe that the sense of rotation matters and as we do a circular movement we tend to excite our mind in a specific way EXCITING THE UNCONSCIOUS Central and Peripheral Vision If you divide our brain into the conscious and subconscious, you could say that cone (central) vision is processed consciously, whereas rod (peripheral) vision is processed subconsciously. At most times, your subconscious mind functions in the background, sifting through huge streams of information for your conscious mind to consider.
