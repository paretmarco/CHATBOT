In this, whether you hear a voice, a bird, traffic sounds, find the space at the end of the sound. If you're listening to a sentence in your mind or to an idea, find the VOID at the end of the sound. You're going to drop into that space, that silence, that VOID. Practice: Begin by experiencing the space or the VOID after the occurrence of a sound, of a word, or an idea, or any sound. Use any sound, either "inside" or "outside" "yourself," and find the space at the end of it. Sink deeply into that space. Whenever you're ready, bring your awareness back to the room; notice your breathing and let your eyes open. Contemplate: That the senses move not by my will or your will, but by the will of the VOID or EMPTINESS. ________________ Chapter IV "I'd" like you to contemplate the five senses. Senses are moved not by your own personal will but by the the VOID or EMPTINESS. For example, if your eyes move a certain way, it's the VOID.
