In other words, the emotional states exists only related to contexts and situations. Emotional states are in a superposition scheme until the moment in which they are not determined by measuring them in a specific context. Emotional states can also be defined interior activators. Emotional states always exist in digital form, that is, each emotional state is opposed to its opposite. To emotional states we connect the concept of "physiological state of action" linguistically corresponding to the verbs and "environmental indices" linguistically corresponding to the various elements (place, agent etc ...). Environmental indices exist only in function of their localization in a context space and time of their conceptualization. The processes of abstraction and association of neuronal networks within the mind mean that more environmental indexes of second level may be gathered in the top-level or "constructs" and give shape to a class even higher. Among indices, constructs (second-level indicators) and physiological states produces a process called "activation" which leads to activate through the mediation of emotional states, the states of physiological action An experiment with monkeys has shown that in fact: the monkeys orient themselves according to certain environmental indices, some specific objects (eg, a banana) corresponding in humans to a higher level constructs, and defining a specific action (eg climbing) for each spatial location.
