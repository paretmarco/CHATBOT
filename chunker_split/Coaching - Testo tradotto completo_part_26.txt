Let us make it clear that developing vitality has nothing to do with muscular vigour or with the robustness of one’s physical constitution. The latter are desirable conditions, inasmuch as frequent diseases and muscular weakness represent causative agents of inferiority. Nevertheless, a 70-year old person might have greater vitality than a 20-year old one, since true vitality is a surplus, and as such equated to the scenario where one has in his bank account available cash to spend. What we are saying here, in fact, is that true consciousness of oneself and true will are rooted in a surplus of nervous tension (or neuric strength), which primarily consists in a mental aspect. What it is, then, that we should do? We must learn how to create and store away, how to accumulate tension within a balanced organism. This state is named “vital erethism”. We are immersed in a state of vital erethism whenever our nervous potential is high, in other terms, whenever we have some energy demanding to be released.
