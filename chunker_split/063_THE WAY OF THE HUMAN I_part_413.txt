She gives Thesues a twine of thread (stringâ€”a representation of the path) so that he may enter the Labyrinth and find his way back out safely. Theseus enters the Labyrinth, kills the Minotaur (sexuality) and escaRes (the thread is the path into and out of the Labyrinth of the unconscious mind). They flee Crete for Athens, but when Thesus reaches a small island, he abandons Adriane (the feminine who had showed him the path into and out of the unconsious mind). Quantum Psychology suggests that the loss of sexuality is the beginning of the end for "relationships." Notice in your life how when sexuality disappears from a relationship, the partner feels abanddned and the relationship is finished. Why? Because real sexuality and marriage are only satisfying when there is an integration, and when sexuality can aid in that end. If sexuality is abandoned (destroyed), then the natural biological integration is no more. With that, the masculine and feminine are two. This disintegration is so painful that it often signals the end of a marriage. This is a real life sequence.
