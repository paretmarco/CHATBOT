Take the BIG EMPTINESS and condense it down and make it into another concept called mother. And then thin it out and make it back into BIG EMPTINESS. How are you feeling now? Real vibrating, lots of energy. So now I would like for you to be in your ESSENCE. This part you might want to do eyes open or eyes closed. You decide as we go along. So go into your own ESSENCE, then I want you to fall further back into that VOID beyond the ESSENCE. What's happening now? There's no separation. Go into it and take some VOID and condense it clown and make it into a mom and take some VOID and condense it down and make it into a Barbara. Now, decide that the Barbara is me and the mother is "Not Me." Now, again, very slowly, intentionally decide that Barbara is me and mother is the "Not Me." The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter 1 Barbara:It's hard to do right now. Wolinsky:Then imagine there is pain inside of this condensed EMPTINESS called Barbara because she's the me and mother is the "Not Me."
