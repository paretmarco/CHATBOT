Debra:To get even with you, because you can't give me what I want, I'm going to steal your husband. It wasn't very nice. I'm feeling guilty. What did you create in response to them being affectionate and you being out of the picture? Well, me wanting some affection from one of them. I didn't care which one. I would like for you to have an image of all men out there. Look at your dad and notice how just the crumbs from your father made you feel so worthwhile. It didn't take much. Make the statement to these men that "I will just beg for the crumbs if that is what I can get." I've done that too. Say to your father, "I didn't get much, I'll beg for the crumbs." I didn't get much, so I will just beg for the crumbs. And to men out there, "Since I didn't get much, I'll become your reflection just to get the crumbs." Since I didn't get much, I'll just reflect you to get the crumbs.
