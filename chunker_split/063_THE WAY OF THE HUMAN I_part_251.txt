For example, if I get involved with a woman, there's going to be a biological interest in merging and that's fine as long as I simultaneously know she is a human being, has her own life and a whole universe that is separate from mine. In other words I do not collapse the levels and think she is or has to be the same as me (see Volume II). In this way, I can have a biological merging or unity experience at one level while simultaneously maintaining other levels of separation (i.e., thinking and emotional, biological, external). Prob- 154 Chapter VIII lems in relationship occur because people do not distinguish levels. If you have a past time body image of yourself, you have to hold a past time body image of her/him. This might make her/him into my mother or father. This means I have frozen and collapsed the external biological, thinking, and emotional levels. Then, you go through rages, fear, depression, etc. when she/he says "I can't make it Friday night." Why? Because you are in your past time body image, and hence you are collapsing the levels.
