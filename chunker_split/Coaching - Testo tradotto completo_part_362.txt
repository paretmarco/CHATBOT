— This first phase consists in defining what is it that we want, and elaborating a direction for the actions aimed at accomplishing it. What this phase thus essentially amounts to is to reliantly call upon that part of our selves which is steeped in “globality”, for the purpose of working out directions and possibilities. We might implement this phase in two possible ways, which we shall refer to by the names “classical” and “accelerated” or “modern”. The “classical” way encompasses two distinct moments: The first such moment is in the evening, at the time when we have concluded our daily work (better still, just a short while prior to going to bed), whereas the second one is in the morning (preferably before one has eaten anything). In the evening, we should submit to ourselves the data in respect of which some inspiration is required. We should submit to ourselves the constituent elements of the problem requiring a solution. “Here is what I want”.
