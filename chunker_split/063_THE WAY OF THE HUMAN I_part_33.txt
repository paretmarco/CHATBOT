This disconnection from our body and our animal nature leads us into more isolation, aloneness, alienation and misunderstandingsâ€”in short, our False Core (to be discussed in Volume II). Ultimately, to deny our connection to our body denies our connection to the world. To deny our connection to the world is to deny our connection to the universe and to the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness. In the past, oftentimes yoga in the form of mantras, yantras, and tantras has taken us out of the world. Spiritual philosophies have claimed, "You are not your body," and that sex and emotions are to be avoided. Yet, as many a fallen guru and spiritual master might now finally concede, this is not possible. The question is why would anyone want to? If there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, what is there to get rid of? Why would you even want to get rid of your animal or psycho-emotional nature, or as you might say, "As you judge, so shall you be judged." Or in Quantum Psychological terminology, "As you judge yourself, so shall you judge others."
