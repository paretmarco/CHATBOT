SPIRITUALIZATION The deepest form of trance-ference is spiritualization which occurs when the trance-Terence of idealization is solidified and moves to the next step.' In spiritualization, idealization is not resolved. In other words, mom and dad are not seen as human beings but instead are super-idealized and seen as gods, saints, or great teachers. This goes on to create what Quantum Psychology calls the god or guru trance. Once in the early '70s and recently in Norway I knew people who had idealized his guru and kept on telling me how great he wasâ€”certainly much smarter than mine. I said to them, to point out his spiritualized trance, "My guru can beat up your guru." The spiritualization trance-ference is the next step after idealization. discussed this in Chapter 14 of The Dark Side of the Inner Child: the Next Step.

Quantum Psychology believes that the idea of using trance-ference was constructed by the therapist's own counter-trance- ference issues.
