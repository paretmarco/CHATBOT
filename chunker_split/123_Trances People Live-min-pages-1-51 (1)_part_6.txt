Ile is almost saying that trance is a new word for feelings. it is also a new word for the residuals of our life history. As he moves from this point to a larger understanding and explanation of experiencing oneself as the context for one's feel- ings, he finds an intriguing way of teaching others how to experience the transformational insight that "I am not my problem." His understanding of the move from intrapersonal trance to interpersonal trance is a delightful extrapolation from the beginning premise that "..11â€¢11111111110 tiiby myself." He not only makes it clear that an extrapolation within the context of self-hood, ..I arentranced -ymptonis areOt sl-hood, or person-hood, but goes from there to a perspective of th isychotherapyperson_ experience that includes the therapist's hood. Dr. Wolinsky's concept of the integrity of the therapist and his belief that the therapist-patient identity is a unity, and that lat th therapist's interpersonal honesty and freedom to express himself is cenual to his own beingness, makes the quality of this book la u-anscendent experience. I loved reading Trances People Live, I highly recommend it and please don't be confused by the word hypnosis. Dr. wor -.I insky is talking about life.
