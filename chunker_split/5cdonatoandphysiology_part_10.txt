Enrico Morselli, one of Italy's leading psychiatrists of the period, assisted and himself succumbed to the fascination of Donato. In his important 1886 study on animal magnetism and hypnotic states, Morselli provided a rather positive portrait of the man. He had exchanged the magician’s cap for the more sober tuxedo-quite approach. Donato “rejects fluids, rejects the power and transmissions of will; nor does he trade in somnambulistic lucidity. He doesn't claim to have special power or gifts. Instead he claims that it his quick and insistent 'gaze' that produces a rapid and sudden shock to the nervous system of sensitive individuals. Where there is no "orgasm" he said, his method doesn't work (Morselli 1886, 281). Morselli claims that these shows come close to producing a political crisis right at the center of Europe. In effect in Switzerland, the president of the confederation was an opponent of Donato, but was mystified by what Donato did, and his opponent tried to get advantage of it. But what was so revolutionary about Donato's method? Why were the spectacles at the Teatro Scribe in Turin perceived to be so radically new?
