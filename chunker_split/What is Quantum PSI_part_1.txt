Quantum Psi (c) is a discipline that combines the metaphorical use of quantum physics, quantum hypnosis, and alchemy to help people find inner harmony and experience non-local effects such as telepathy and synchronicity. One of the key concepts of Quantum Psi is overcoming the fascination that is created between the observer and the observed, also known as the observer-observed dyad, which refers to the fact that observation can influence the behavior of something according to the principles of quantum physics. To achieve this state, people must learn to overcome the fascination of the observer-observed dyad through mastery of the process of fascination, that is, observing without judgment. In this way, they can access the non-local effects of the universe and achieve a sense of unity with the world around them. The concept is also related to quantum hypnosis which deconstructs limiting beliefs, mental blocks and anything that blocks us mentally from recovering the entirety of ourselves.
