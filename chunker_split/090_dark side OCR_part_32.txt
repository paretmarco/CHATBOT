The Dark Side of the Inner Child I imagine many people would argue about the precious inner child, its value, its innocence, etc. At this time we need to under- stand that this "inner child" has a dark side. This inner child that some therapies are trying desperately to preserve is responsible for many present time problems. For example, let' s imagine in order to survive with Mom/Dad, you had to create a part that would mind read what Mom/Dad were thinking, so that you could get what you needed. The problem arises when the frozen child within your mind reads, projects and imag- ines what people are thinking and feeling in present time and tries to fulfill the imagining, or reacts to that imagined projection as if it were true. Very often it is not true. The dark side of the inner child hypnotizes the adult into reacting to present time as if it were past time. This is what I call the dark side. It is the wounded inner child who mis-interprets, misconstrues, and misunderstands much of what it sees. To worship a precious inner child is to ignore its dark side.
