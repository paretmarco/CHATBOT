To recapitulate, a trance is accordingly a daily phenomenon, in spite of the possibility that we might fail to realize that, due to the fact that, normally, our conscious mind denies the reality of such phenomenon. ________________ 8. The daily trance As stated earlier, hypnosis is part and parcel of the normal process of daily communication. The only difference between self-hypnosis and daily hypnosis is that, when you carry out some procedure of self-hypnosis, or you voluntarily empower a trained hypnotist to hypnotize you, it is your person who chooses the ideas which you allow your mind to react to, whereas, during “daily hypnosis”, by virtue of the sheer quantity and multiplicity of the sources from which the messages reaching you originate, you enter a state of trance in respect of something where your control over the quality and amplitude of the ideas that pervade your minds is inferior. We refer, by the term "daily trance", to the phenomenon whereby, at some moments in our life, our perception of reality is altered by our internal filters, whereupon we no longer perceive reality, but only our specific vision of the same.
