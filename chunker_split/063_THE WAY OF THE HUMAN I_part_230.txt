It should be noted that after conception the first part of the body formed is the bi-polar (i.e., electromagnetic) spine or core. Let us look at this statement from both a Quantum Psychology and also from a Reichian therapy perspective. Ida Rolf was saying that alignment on a biological level takes place when this core is aligned with 142 Chapter VIII the gravitational pull of the earth and sun. Quantum Psychology would say that breakages in the gravitational alignment in the core causes psychological structures to emerge (thoughts, beliefs, etc.) to compensate or explain for this breakage or interruption. In short, "your" individual separate "I" is a creation of the nervous system. Moshe Feldenkrais once said that "the purpose of the nervous system is to organize chaos." In this way, it can be said that this natural neurological process creates psychology to order the chaos. Korzybski's structural differential is a pictorial representation of what he calls the nervous system's abstracting process. This is a process whereby the nervous system, as part of this natural neurological order, describes, labels, and makes inferences from the non-verbal.
