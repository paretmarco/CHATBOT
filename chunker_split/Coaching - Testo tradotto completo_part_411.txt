Focus the imagine of the client at the time when you help him feel satisfaction about the item he has purchased (Your volitional push will have to be undiluted and characterized by a robust yearning to have a neater vision of the mental representations thus created, as if you were by a movie hall). Picture yourselves being successful! Let us become what we think we are! The morning of the following day, prior to actually beginning negotiations with client, go mentally, for no more than forty seconds, by means of rapid mental flashes, through all the various stages of the sale as carried out by tele-psychology the night before. Results will punctually materialize ... It will be your own client who will do the sale for you: He is going to buy because you would have helped him get what he desired. You would have been on his side. This is the big secret! The goal would have thus been attained, to the full satisfaction of both of you. All that will be needed is to always speak the truth: The truth is in need of no miracles, just as no miracle can ever succeed in validating what is false.
