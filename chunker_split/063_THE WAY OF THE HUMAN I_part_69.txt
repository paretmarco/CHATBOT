QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Every event and attempt to heal and compensate for the False Core is the False Self doing it. In this way, it only re-enforces the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator dyad. People often respond to the False Core by saying, "If only I didn't feel (fill in the blank), everything would be fine." In this way they are always trying to get rid of the False Core structure by overcompensation. For example; in order to handle (fill in the blank), I'll take another lover. I'll make more money and then I won't be the blank). If I have more experiences, then I'll be smart enough and I won't feel (fill in the blank).

I've organized my whole life around a concept which is not true. How amazing!"
