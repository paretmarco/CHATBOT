Accordingly, in this book, and through this type of coaching, we will not only convoy you to success (provided you want it for yourselves), which shines on whoever has the ability of finding original and effective solutions, but also, at the same time, to true freedom, freedom, that is, from a series of automatic mechanisms which divert you from your own selves by clouding the geniality of your mind, and which rob you of your life and your time, to such an extent that it is legitimate to say, with regard to some people who have always spent their existence steeped in a “routine”, ‘Though he officially lived for eighty years, in reality they were some twenty years at most’ 16. How does that come about? Man manufactures with his own hands the chains which fetter him and despoil him of his own life. These chains are represented by his thoughts and habits, which not only subtract from him time, but take away his pleasure as well. That is so as this quality appears to be captive to some phantasmal future, though man is unable to recognize it in the present.
