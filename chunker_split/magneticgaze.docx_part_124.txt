Various methods of staring at the subject for the sake of hypnosis 1. Methods based on a fixed look The central look: Among the methods of fixing one’s look on the subject, the most common one is the look directed to the centre, between the eyes [58]. Look through one eye only: As for the Baron of Reichenbach, he had noticed how fixing the left eye on the operator’s right eye was particularly effective [59]. The very same method is suggested by Eliphas Levi. Ormond Mc Gill, too, reports a similar methodology [60]. Backward look: Yet another efficacious method consists in staring at the back of a person[61]. 2. Methods that adopt a look in motion The methods using motion are of very ancient origin. The eyes might even tremble, which is a phenomenon the ancient people termed “equi effigie” (image of a horse) so as to indicate the rapid motion like the one which a horse engages in [62]. Pliny, indeed, recounts the fact that some nations hypnotize whilst having an “image of a horse” in their pupils.
