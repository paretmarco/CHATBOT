Deep In order to get to the foundational level, demystification is a must. Human beings are prey to their own ideas, though ideas are in actual fact serviceable aids of a person. This is why it is advisable to come down to the reptilian level, which is indeed what we actually do during the process of fascination. The concepts of the reptilian are in fact very basis. We should strive to be very reptilian by reaching, essentially, a level where there is no space for emotions anymore. We have to ascertain how many selves of ours (different personalities) exist, and thus get to the bottom of things. We are dealing here with another dimension: Either one is immersed in this dimension or he is caught in his non-stop mental dialogue. At times, this state might be looked upon unfavourably in certain circumstances. A person who is present instils fear in some people, inasmuch as he does not involve himself in their frivolous games. These concepts open up our mind to the comprehension of how presence should be linked to presence in the action. Presence allows us to enjoy where we happen to live. No stress is involved in exercising this kind of presence.
