For example, I have a biological fear when I have the flu, or I break my arm, as opposed to, I have a psychological fear that the world will destroy me which is an association of the thinking dimension collapsed into the emotional dimension. The former is hard-wired into the nervous system. The latter is an abstraction and distortion and a catastrophic projected future. THE REMEDY 1Acknowledge the dimensions. 2. Cut the chain of associations by processing associations (going beyond) which are fused to the biological False Cores. 3. Go into the non-verbal levels of the biological False Cores prior to the associational networks. 4. Breath into and "have" the experience. Often times, I notice (with #4 above) that "my breath" seems to move from upper to lower spine. The lower spine is "older" evolutionary-wise (i.e., before the cortical brain took over spinal function in directing neurological impulses). Thus, this integrates the most basic "reflex" and earliest functions.
