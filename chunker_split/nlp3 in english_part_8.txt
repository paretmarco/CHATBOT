The "rapport" we can get using such elements is so strong that each therapeutic change happens really easier and faster than with any other method. The reason of this strong "rapport" is in the fact that we don't communicate on the surface (as when we use just words); instead we communicate on a more deep and profound level, involving emotionally our client. We don't need to do complex verbal reeducations or reframings before of doing this kind of hypnosis, and this because we do them already non verbally. We need about 2 to 4 minutes to bring people in "deep hypnosis" and you'll find astonishing results and incredible therapeutic possibilities. One of the most important thing to follow in a non verbal induction is the feedback of the client; here are some of the most important elements to check: SOME ELEMENTS OF FEEDBACK IN A MULTISENSORY INDUCTION: 1. Swaying — Phisical swaying means mental swaying; disponibility to let himself go. 2. No reaction when touched — Acceptance of the hypnotist. 3. Swallowing — Emotional response. 4. Cataleptic arms — Acceptance of non-verbal suggestions. 5. Relaxed arms — Not enough involvement in the rapport. 6. Tensed (resisting) arms — Lack of confidence in the hypnotist. 7. Laughing — The subject is in a situation in wich he feels the insufficiency of his normal schema of references; he is not in complete cointrol of the situation; for this reason could be the best moment to use a very direct approach.
