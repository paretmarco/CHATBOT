Worry is to the engine of the brain what ashes and wastage are to the other types of machines, i.e. a noxious material which has to be cleared out. The process which is needed to uproot worry consists in refusing to accept it as an item in the list of human faculties. After such operation of extirpating surgery is over, man will feel healthier and more vigorous. Preoccupation is not just — as the word might outwardly like to indicate — a phenomenon of emotional foreseeing, i.e. one of negative premonition about the future, since it might also be of a different kind. Preoccupation is derived partly from our experiences, by which we mean the accumulated pile of prejudices and fears which lies in the depths of our unconscious, and partly from, yet again, the constitutional form of emotionalism. No effort to cure such weakness will ever be excessive. Eradicating worry has the connotation of clarifying our life, and of placing our self in a well defined relationship with the Universe around us from the dual viewpoint of time and space.
