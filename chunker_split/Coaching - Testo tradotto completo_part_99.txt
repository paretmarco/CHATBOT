Developing geniality, originality and mental power Relaxation, the state of mental void, and the technique of the light which has been laid out here above, represent in truth the essential path for developing the quality of originality we have just spoken about in the preceding pages of this work. The first studies on the subject which have been conducted in recent times, precisely in 1978 by the psychologist Colin Martindale from Maine University, had already shown that there are two stages to creativity, namely, inspiration and elaboration. When his “guinea pigs” (writers placed under electroencephalographic monitoring) were busy creating, the cerebral activity was markedly reduced (= in a state of rest). That is the moment of inspiration. For the most creative among them, the electroencephalogram used to record an even higher figure of alpha waves. It is essential, in order to understand how that occurs, to differentiate between two parts which are present inside our mind: 1.
