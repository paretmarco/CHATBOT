According to Donnelly, It is the alignment around the BIOLOGICAL CORE (and it is a physical core not only energetic, like Yogis would say) that aligns the biology with earth and the sun on a gravitational level through the vehicle of the body. Rolf's statement has enormous ramifications in regard to what Quantum Psychology calls the realization of BIOLOGICAL ESSENCE. This experiential realization leads us to an understanding that the body is made of the same substance as everything else, and we begin to see the BIOLOGICAL CORE's relationship to other spiritual disciplines. For example, Taoist literature says something like, "When heaven and earth are aligned, the Tao is realized. When heaven and earth are aligned balance will occur," or "when heaven 136 Chapter VIII and earth are balanced, the true nature of the Tao [the way] will be revealed." I realized if we substitute the word Sun for the word heaven we have the true biological meaning of BIOLOGICAL CORE. In other words, "when we realize and experience the effortlessness of the gravitational pull on a biological level between the Sun (heaven) and the earth, then we will experience alignment with The Way (The Tao).
