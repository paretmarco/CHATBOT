I am talking about an energetic-genetic component which I've seen in many people I've worked with; individuals seem to have a genetic-energetic proclivity toward a particular False Core-False Self. THE ORIGIN OF THE FALSE CORE THE NARCISSISTIC WOUND/INJURY STORY Developmental psychology would say that at birth infants believe that they and their mother are one. It is only between the ages of 5-12 months that children realize they are separate from their mother. This realization comes as a huge shock to the Nervous System and causes what is called the "narcissistic wound" or the "narcissistic injury." What Quantum Psychology would say is that at the moment of that shock, your False Core begins to solidify. What an infant concludes about her/himself and the situation when she/he realizes they are separate from Mom is the False Core. For example, "I am separate because I am worthless," or "I am separate because I'm inadequate," or "I am separate means I don't exist," or "I am separate because I am powerless," etc. once this conclusion solidifies.
