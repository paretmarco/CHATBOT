The system of NLP 3 also integrates (at its ground level) a series of completely new elements compared to the most traditional schools of PNL, and precisely: Pre-Verbal Symbolism in communication —the comprehension of the symbolic meaning of the gestures Use of olfactory cues in communication Gustatory cues Non verbal Hypnosis (multisensory) New ways of extracting strategies in the field of salesmanship that render obsolete the old schemes New way of doing self-hypnosis Enneagram and its connection with NLP (with a new system) A contribution to classical way of analizing metaprograms (distinguishing the persons on the basis of their questions relating to others: Persons Who, What, Why and How) A new operational diagram of values’ analysis NLP 3 is complementary to traditional PNL, and amplifies its effectiveness. THE CORE OF HYPNOSIS, MULTISENSORY HYPNOSIS, HYPNOSIS WITHOUT WORDS Hypnosis is often linked with the use of words, the right use of meaningful words. But in reality, as studies show, just the smallest part of our communication go through words, while the biggest part go through non verbal elements. This is the reason why is normally difficult to learn an hypnotic technique just from a book. Is it possible to hypnotize without using no meaningfull words at all but just these other elements? The answer is surely yes. We can use codes and elements of our social non verbal communication to bring people in a trance deeper than any trance they had ever experienced. Every phrase we use in our normal communication has a non verbal meaning and the words exist just as substitutes for things or other non verbal codes.
