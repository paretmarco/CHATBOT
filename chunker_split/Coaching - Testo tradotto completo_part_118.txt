Ours must be a genuine war strategy: The thought, the mental energy, must not be found scattered across too vast a space, for otherwise no propelling force and no countering power might possibly be deployed. If, on the other hand, we manage to gather our energies in a single bundle, we might successfully resist a formidable collision, or even be able to launch in turn an attack of ours against some fortress. Being Present - The relativity of everything It is now time to move to some reflections which, though broader, do not thereby cease to be predominantly practical. The underlying concept we would like to introduce you to here is the extent to which the preceding exercises might also represent exercises aiming at the reintegration and reclaiming of our own selves. We cannot, indeed, be truly happy or establish any real life plan so long as we are not connected to our own selves and to reality. Why do we speak of re-integration? The answer to that question is found in yet another question: To which extent are we actually dis-integrated? The dispersion we have dealt with in the previous pages of this book is in fact a dis-integration.
