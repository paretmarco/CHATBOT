Illusions can be sensory, auditory, or visual: seeing something that is not said, or hearing something that is not there, or feeling something that is not there. Case 2: Upon my return from India, I was looking for an office in Albuquerque. One week before I arrived, a therapist had rented space from my doctor friend who owned a building. When I met the therapist who was renting the office, he looked uncomfortable learning I was a therapist looking for an office. He told my secretary, "His energy is so aggressive I can just feel it." Another doctor in the office said, "Wow, you feel great; I heard you just got back from 86 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child India; maybe we could meditate together some time." Who was feeling things that weren't there? I don't know, but certainly each inner child illusioned a different experience of "my energy." The therapist felt threatened and, hence, "my energy" was aggressive, the doctor wanted a friend to meditate with so, "my energy" felt great.
