For example, a six floors building occupies on the retina the same space as an object near, yet we are able to judge its size, even with an eye closed. There is also a physiological correlate: the more distant the individualâ€™s dark focus, the greater his or her tendency to focus beyond an acuity target and to maximize apparent size. This will create a greater discrimination of detail. In fact judgments of apparent size are highly correlated with visual accommodation distance, and in aviation it has been proved that the difficulty of detecting airplanes on stationary collision courses is greatly aggravated when focus is trapped by structure close to the eyes. While alteration in sensory perceptions has something in common with the jargon of Ericksonian hypnosis there is also a list of phenomena that don't pertain to Ericksonian hypnosis ENTERING THE SPACE OF "NOTHING": THE MANDELBAUM EFFECT Accommodation is the physiological process by which the eye brings objects at different distances into focus. The Mandelbaum effect refers to an inadvertent accommodation response to an intervening surface (e.g. the hand) while attempting to focus a distant object of interest (the operator).
