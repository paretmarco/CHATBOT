It's the old saying: "there but for the grace of God (the VOID) go I." The VOID creates the mind by appearing to become solid, by condensing down, and ultimately, to see the mind and everything else as made of and by the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (SELF) and as THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: See each dimension as VOID The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology CONCLUSION The NOT-I-I is "where" Quantum Psychology "ends." The NOT-I-I is "where" pure awareness resides, beyond this is the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, also called the SELF, THAT, etc. It is "there" "where" Quantum Psychology, awareness itself, and the "you" "you" call "you" disappear. And YOU ARE THAT. Good-bye with love, your x-brother Stephen ________________ CHAPTER V THE VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS "There is no there there, there is no here here." Gertrude Stein "That there is no location is the cornerstone of quantum physics." Neils Bohr QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Awareness is a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. It is the condensed VOID being aware of itself.
