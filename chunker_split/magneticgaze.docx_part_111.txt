Positive hallucination (mydriasis – large pupil) The concept of projection is strongly linked to the concept of positive hallucination. Technical characteristics: A phenomenon of positive hallucination we have often come across might be observed by focusing the eyes on the spot that is located immediately after the person we are looking at (as if we were looking behind him). It might even be carried out before a mirror with a view to “lending voice to the unconscious”. Note on the treatment: In order to avoid transference phenomena in the event of positive hallucinations, we might request the patient to observe something enabling him to distinguish the operator from his past memory. 6. Temporal distortion (Long time and short time) (Tension and Retention) It appears that longer time is escorted by muscular resistance and the retention of one’s breath. It often goes along with a narrowing of the attention field. One can further notice that it is accompanied by a lack of conceptualization: An unexpected route seems to be longer than a previously known road. 7. Confusion (strabismus) One can discern, under this heading, phenomena of confusion, by observing a person through the medium of diverging strabismus.
