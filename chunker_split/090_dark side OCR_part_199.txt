As the adult matures, they can become conservative, politically, and the adult can believe, "the rich and powerful will take care of the rest of us." The problem is the rich and powerful take care of themselves, leaving our inner children feeling victimized. Cognizing that the rich and powerful will "trickle down" money to us is a trance of the inner child, and a fusion with Mom and Dad. This keeps the present-time adult from feeling empowered. Three Basic First Level Processes 1. 1 created it: This trance relates to the beliefs the infant develops when he is born, opens his eyes, and sees Mom, Dad, nurse, doctor, etc. What is cognized? "I created Mom and Dad." The infant believes this, and often this belief is carried into adulthood. The results, as we will explore later, are paramount to the develop- ment of a self-view, a world view and the adaptation of a spiritual philosophy. 2. Infantile grandiosity: The baby feels cold and Mom or Dad places a blanket on her. Next, baby thinks hungry, and Mom or Dad brings food.
