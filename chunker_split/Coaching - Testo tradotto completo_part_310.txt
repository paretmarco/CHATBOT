In order to be energetic when dealing with our own selves, we have to put an end to too comfortable a habit, namely, the one of feeling pity over ourselves. We are afraid to cause ourselves (our body, and our soul) too much suffering. We ought by contrast to train ourselves, even as regards the most common acts of our quotidian existence, on how to let thought be followed by action, and on how to be more in the "doing” than in the “I am doing”. What is needed from a practical viewpoint is to stop identifying yourselves with your tiny little egotistic self, in order to identify yourselves with a more comprehensively global dimension. Lastly, it is incumbent on you to inject vital energy and presence into whatever you do. Dress up, shave your beard, eat, and walk with greater energy and consciousness of your sensations. This does not mean you should act as madmen. Quite the reverse, as you will be required to act in a truly normal and rational way, one which is totally detached from your puny egotistic “self”. In one word, doing it the way it should be done.
