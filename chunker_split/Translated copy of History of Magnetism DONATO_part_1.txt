I - Before Mesmer Magnetism is as old as the planet itself. There were many philosophers and thaumaturges among the ancient peoples, but they lacked a precise understanding of its causes and effects. Touch and hand application, fascination with the aid of the eyes, and other forms of touch-based medicine are all documented in the history of the Indians, Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Gauls, and other peoples. Pomponace, writing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, acknowledges that some people have amazing influences on other people's willpower. Paracelsus becomes famous for using his hands to treat diseases that were previously thought to be incurable. "There is such an energy in man that he can operate outside by his will alone and his imagination alone," renowned physician Van Helmont wrote in 1630. He calls this "energy" Magnetism. In 1673 Maxvell published his treatise on magnetic medicine. "But, as Donato aptly put it, the forerunners of Mesmer were: some of the thaumaturges, acting in secret, using mysteriously a force which they had observed, without being able or without wanting to explain it; the others being metaphysicians, who were content to write about a thing with which they had apparently no personal experience. "History can and should consider only men who act effectively. "Inventions and discoveries do not become known until the day when they are presented to the public in their true form and exposed to the appreciation and investigation of men. "Mesmer was the first to combine experiments with theory and teaching in the field of magnetism. "
