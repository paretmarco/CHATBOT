This is Quantum Observation, which is different from just observing.6 CONDENSATION: a condensed state or form, the act of condensing or shrinking down; the act of reducing a gas or vapor to a liquid or solid form. Condensations are everything. Since "Everything is made of emptiness and form is condensed emptiness," then all of the above are condensations of THAT ONE CONSCIOUSNESS. 97 The Way of the Human • Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Therapeutic Note This is extremely important to understand. Einstein has said that "Everything is emptiness and form is condensed emptiness." In this way, you can begin to see all manifestations as condensed EMPTINESS—including the observer-knower of thoughts, emotions, and objects. Then the observer and the object disappear. This is a step in moving from the observer-observed knower-known dyad into the NOT-I-I of pure awareness or WITNESSING (see Volume III).
