If a thought goes through your awareness called "It's difficult" and you identify with it, your mind will work out a whole story to validate the "I" thought you identified with. "I was never able to do it," "I never could do it," "I knew I shouldn't have come here," "I knew I should have gone to the movies," and on and on. The content of your story doesn't matter. The minute you identify with "It's difficult," then the whole chain of associations begins and that's what your experience will be. Suppose you had an opposite reactionâ€”that "this is great," and you identify and fuse with that. Then you have an experience of its being great. To repeat an earlier story, a student came to Nisargadatta Maharaj and said "I want to be happy." Nisargadatta Maharaj replied, "That's nonsense. Happiness is where the 'I' isn't." You are not your associations or patterns. That's not who you are. Stay prior to it. Practice: Again, you don't hake to think of an answer.
