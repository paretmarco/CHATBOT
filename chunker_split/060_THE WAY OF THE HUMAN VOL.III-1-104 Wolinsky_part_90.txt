There is an electro-magnetic dimension, a weak force radioactive (the earth), a strong force radioactive (the sun), gravity, sound, particle realities, waves, light and dark matter. These Physics Dimension and forces exist, as do others, some known, some yet to be discovered. But given that Quantum Psychology has one foot in the world of physics, it is important to be able to; 1) identify the Physics Dimensions and forces which appear to be outside of ourselves (but are not) and are actually everything we imagine ourselves to be; 2) bring the concepts into awareness; and 3) dismantle them. THE DIMENSIONS AND ARCHETYPES The question is why this in a chapter on the Archetypes and the Collective Dimension and why is this a part of Quantum Psychology? The answer to the first question is that we need to dismantle our concepts about "things" which are not the "things" themselves so we can experience what "is" and go beyond. The second question focuses on the Collective Unconscious with its Archetypes, or better yet, the Physics Dimensions, as the source of what we call Archetypes and what we call the "Personal I."
