If you want to stay, stay; if you don't, then leave." Now, I was shocked. He had busted my trance-ference immediately as it came up. He didn't wait. He didn't enjoy it; he didn't play my game. "I" was disoriented and confused for weeks. That was some twenty years ago and I have kept that understanding and philosophy with me. The shock I felt was caused by his not only refusing to go along with 'my trance-ference but also my narcissistic mirroring of him, in order to get him to merge with me. He did not need my mirroring, adoration or merger. His job was clearâ€”bust the trance-ference, bust the narcissism so that I could be free from the concepts I was unknowingly operating out of. BUST THE TRANCE-FERENCE, BUST THE NARCISSISM That is the presenting issue of all issues. Then, handle what comes up around it. DE--IDEALIZING BREAKING THE TRANCE-FERENCE In the Quantum approach, once the trance-ference and narcissism are seen, they're confronted and dealt with. At each step during therapy, the therapist is asked to break the trance-ference of idealization.
