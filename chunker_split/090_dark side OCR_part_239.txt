This is a brilliant way to handle the external chaos of a dysfunctional family. Create an inner-idealized family and then spiritualize them. A child cannot depend on the outer Mom or Dad, so why not create an idealized inner Mom and Dad? Then through transpersonal transference, which resists chaos, have the created internal gods and goddesses give us the answers and explanations the other Dad/gods and Mom/goddesses could not. Often archetypes are internalized, idealized moms and dads that the child created because there was no one to fulfill these roles. In some psychologies and religious systems, the inner is said to be better than the outer. Inner gods/goddesses are better (more ideal), and people who are introverted are more evolved than those who are extroverted. When a system is created to make sense of the world and the world makes no sense to the inner child, developing an introverted system with super-idealized parents (now called gods or goddesses), keeps the psychological system of the inner child alive.
