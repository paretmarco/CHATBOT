201) Chaos for the purposes of this book includes states of confu- sion, being overwhelmed, out of control, feeling crazy, and emptiness or void. In the resistance to the feeling of chaos comes the organization of trances, which hopes to make sense out of that which doesn't make sense or does not compute. Interestingly enough, Buddhists for centuries have said the greatest resistance people have is to emptiness (chaos). Once an experience like being molested is resisted, the child will protect herself from experiencing the pain of knowing what happened, by surrounding it with confusion, and often several other trances. Often people will develop a spiritual philosophy to justify how they have organized the chaos, (See Chapter 14, Spiritualiza- tion). Principle VII: It is a "shift" of consciousness from just observing the situation through confusion or chaos to creating identities to meet the unknown situation. For example, a child who is asked to do something by Mom gets confused and, through trial and error, behaves the way Mom wants.
