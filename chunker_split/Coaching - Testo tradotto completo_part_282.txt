Another part shall be devoted to receive, every evening, a synopsis of the material and spiritual occurrences of the relevant day; a most concise diary which should not exclude — with regard to whoever loves to keep it — the possibility of a far more comprehensive diary. Each day has its own peculiar sentimental hue, which is only partly dependent on extrinsic events. The colour of any such day is set by our physical disposition, by our aspirations about the future, in short, by an assortment of plentiful different factors. What should be noted down in this regard is precisely our general mood or state of being, what in other words differentiates that day from any other day. As it subsequently goes through such notes, our thought must perform two tasks: A) A sentimental task — one, that is, of sheer mental re-enactment — B) A critical task — by in other words examining, under the detached light of a time interval, if and how one might have done things better, and thus whether or not we have laid to waste the energy we had been blessed with on that specific day.
