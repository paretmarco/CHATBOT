Life is a system within which you operate, and where you can win a lot just as well as lose everything. Plentiful individuals run through their existence as if in a trance, without realizing the opportunities which life dishes out, and which accrue in favour of those who know how to keep a state of indifference. As for the those people who let themselves be ridden by emotion, the trading they engage in is emotional and lacks concrete substance. If you want to engage in trading, learn not to fear anything and not to desire anything at an emotional level. This is what we call “presence in the trading” This rule necessitates discipline. It can be started within the physiological context. After you have learnt the method of curbing external manifestations of emotion, you should study how to launch your assault against emotion right inside its very essence. What is therefore required is to get used to strip every action and every fact of its turbid emotional dregs, by reducing it to its pristine objective essence. This technique can easily be explained by resorting to an illustrating example. You find yourselves by some mountain track, by the edge of a cliff.
