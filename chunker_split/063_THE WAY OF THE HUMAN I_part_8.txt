The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out WHO YOU ARE The question is, how can you use the material in this trilogy in a way that you can "facilitate such a process'?" To begin with, this trilogy can be considered and used as a de-programming guide. In other words, the two statements by my teacher Nisargadatta Maharaj which underscore this are: I. "Question everything, do not believe anything." 2. "In order to find out who you are—you must first find out who you are not." With this understanding as a major context for the Quantum work and the discovery of WHO YOU ARE, it is important to begin by exploring how you organize the "you" you call yourself—and bring into question everything you imagine "yoursel' to be. The notions that you have about yourself are just that, notions and concepts about who you are, which is not who you are. Alfred Korzybski, the father of General Semantics, would say it this way: "The idea is not the thing it is referring to."
