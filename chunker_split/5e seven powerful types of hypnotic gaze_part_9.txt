Alternating gaze between eyes is the next technique and speaks to both brain hemispheresâ€¦ As we said, looking at the left eye enhances passivity in the person being looked at. We can increase this state looking firstly at the right eye for some seconds, and going to the left one and staying there afterwards. This method is stronger as looking always at the left eye. In starting a little on the right eye we will "saturate" it, and the effect we will create as we look at the left one will be stronger. As we proceed in our practice we can discover also another hypnotic gaze very useful in hypnosis. It will break away the pattern in which our subject understands and processes reality. Simply we will alternate very fast our gaze between right eye and left eye. And also here we can find a scientific explanation giving even more ground to this ancient method. We live in our map of the world. This map is based on our three-dimensional view of the world. 3-d view in turn is based on the interaction between the left eye and the right eye. We construct our daily three-dimensional reality through interaction between hemispheres.
