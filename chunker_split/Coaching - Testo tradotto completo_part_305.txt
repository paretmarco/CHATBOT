We should begin by creating for ourselves an ideal human type comprising an array of features borrowed from a number of our acquaintances. Such an ideal type will have to encompass our physical, intellectual and moral ideals. We will then elaborate this composite ideal in such a manner that we might come to have of it a detailed vision which is such as to leave us in no doubt as to the attitude that this ideal character is going to adopt across the various sets of circumstances. The mirror The contemplation of this ideal might be greatly facilitated by the under-mentioned procedure: Place yourselves in front of a large mirror, yet imagining to see lying beyond the mirror, not your actual imagine, but rather the ideal image onto which you shall project your entire influence. Even in the absence of a mirror, we can imagine this character being reflected against the wall fronting us. Such a “mental picture” will remain stably ahead of us, until the time when availing ourselves of it eventually sets in. A procedure which complements the preceding one is what is set out here under: “Let is always imagine to be facing the person who is best qualified to lend us advice”.
