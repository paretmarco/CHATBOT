The constituent elements of the life plan A well-reasoned life plan must include all the elements making up our activity, which must combine with one another on the basis of paying due regard to their relative degrees of importance and the mutual impact they exercise on each other. We shall term these elements “frames of the self”, inasmuch as they are related to our different selves. Current State Ideal State Physical State (Health) Physical State (Health) Economic State Economic State Cultural/Spiritual State Cultural/Spiritual State Relationships Relationships Pleasures Pleasures How to coordinate the different frames of the self It would be a mistake to devote one part of our life only to a specific part of ourselves. At any given time, in fact, we represent a whole. The various frames must take turns between one another, thereby complementing each other in such a way that no one of them encroaches upon the others. Thus, neither success nor culture must prevail over the sphere of affections or the field of one's personal relationships. In a similar fashion, the spiritual side must neither be trampled upon not trampling other sides by.
