An individual selectively attends to specific stimuli, combines them in a pattern and conceptualizes the situation. Al- though different persons may conceptualize the same situation in different ways, a particular person tends to be consistent in his response to similar types or events. Rela- tively stable cognitive patterns form the basis for the regularity of interpretations of a particular set of situations. The term Schema designates these stable cognitive pat- terns. When a person faces a particular circumstance, the Schema related to the circumstance is activated. The Schema is the basis for molding data into cognitions (defined as any ideation with verbal or pictorial content). Thus a Schema constitutes the basis for screening out, differentiating, and Prologue + 3 coding stimuli that confront the individual. He categorizes and evaluates his experiences through a matrix of Schemas. The kinds of Schemas employed determine how an indi- vidual will structure different experiences. A Schema may be inactive for long periods of time but can be energized by specific environmental inputs (for example, stressful situ- ations). The schemas activated in a specific situation directly determine how an individual responds.
