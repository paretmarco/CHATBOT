The muscles are orchestrated not to resist and fight the BIOLOGICAL CORE, but to let go and be led by the BIOLOGICAL CORE. Then, there is a connection, and a symphony in pure orchestration and organization. When you are in touch with your BIOLOGICAL CORE, suddenly there are no thoughts, there are no fantasies. And I do and know what to do without any of what Gurdjieff called inner considering. I just am, I just do. Everything just is. I am instantly connected not only to my body but to the external world as well. When that occurs, I more than know I AM. "I" am on the way to the realization that my body is made of the same substance as everything else. In order for this realization to be stabilized, being grounded at the biological level through the BIOLOGICAL CORE seems important. Otherwise "your" experience of unity is limited to only certain contexts. For example, I've met many gurus whose experience of the underlying unity is limited to an Ashram, a cave, a monastery, a retreat, or someplace where they are taken care of. They limit actions, trying to control thoughts, and relationships with people.
