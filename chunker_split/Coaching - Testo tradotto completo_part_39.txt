This will, however, is in actual fact rather than an abstract faculty, contrary to what some people might imagine. Will is only worth its name if it is outwardly actualized in a single direction. In order to kick-start one’s will, therefore, it is necessary to will something, to have a specific purpose. The inherent loftiness of a will — as we shall see here under — is precisely the basis from which its first igniting motion and its effectiveness descend. Objective ? Will (and only at a later stage Will ? Objective) Vitality: The nervous or neuric force Lastly, in order for the will to be fully actualized and attain its purpose, it is an indispensable requirement that it should be conjoined to our nervous force, to that human potential which is also termed “neuric force” or “vital force”. This is a primary force that is linked to man’s naturalness, one which is stirred into motion as soon as man is born. It consists in an exteriorized will to live. It might be compared to the electrical force which is capable of setting a machine in motion.
