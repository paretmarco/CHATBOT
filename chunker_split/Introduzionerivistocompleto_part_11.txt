MAN IS AN ANTENNA THAT CAPTURES AND TRANSMITS; IT CAPTURES WHAT S/HE WANTS AND TRANSMITS WHO S/HE IS!!!!!!!! MAN IS NOT A CREATURE OF CIRCUMSTANCE, CIRCUMSTANCE IS A CREATURE OF MAN!!!!!! THE ESSENCE OF MAN IS IN WHAT HE THINKS!!!!!!! THE PILLARS OF SUCCESS ARE: MOTIVATION AND POSITIVE THOUGHT!!!!!! ENTHUSIASM IS FUNDAMENTAL!!!!!!!!! These beliefs can be useful in the beginning to model your development. If you want to really achieve an aim, you will need, above all, to be sure that your motivation is strong enough to get you the wanted results. “A strong enough reason will give you the necessary know how!!!!! !” The basis of any success is strong motivation, without this push nothing will happen. Therefore, if you want to achieve your aim, you need to continually keep the fire of enthusiasm inside of you alive. Visualize yourself at the end of your goal!!!!!! NLP does not teach anything, it enters into our emotional turmoil, into our sophisticated learning processes, in what we do to construct, destroy and transform. It is unleashed and free from conditioning. Some people can undertake these techniques as a habit of mind while others use them as instruments. Try it; if it works, keep it; if it does no’t work, throw it away. That would be an ATTITUDE!!!!!!
