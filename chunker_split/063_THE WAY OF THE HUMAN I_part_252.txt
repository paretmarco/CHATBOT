The images of your body are not you. If all of the images of the body are gone,hen you just are, you are prior to having taken on these images. As Jesus said, "To enter the kingdom of heaven (the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS), you must be like a child (prior to all images). THE BODY AS AN ANIMAL On a basic level, the body is an animal with animal tendencies. This must be clear otherwise you will always have a problem. It's biological. The animal underlies biology and it is a survival mode. All of the externals—mom, dad, society—try to control this animal nature, whether by toilet training, getting you to eat at a certain time, or to go to bed when you aren't tired. Society/Mom/Dad, etc., are totally trying to organize the animal. When our basic animal nature becomes socialized the repression is very painful. It is because of this pain that much of our psychology develops. Simply put, in reality, parents or society are trying to regulate the animal. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the repression of your animal nature, the greater the False Core and the False Self substitutions.
