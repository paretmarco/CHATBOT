If you take your eyes off your person, in fact, he will get the chance to mull over what you are telling him. So long as he is looking straight at you in the face and you are busy talking to him, he will have but a meagre chance to reflect over the facts you are putting forward to him, in which event it will be more likely that he is going to grant his consent to the proposal without any further discussion, unlike what would be the case were he to be looking elsewhere. The “subtext”: This technique consists in thinking up within your mind, at the crucial times, such phrases as “this is indeed a very interesting proposal to your person, a truly valid proposal”. We would unconsciously change our look and expression, and we would notice how our interlocutor is going to consequentially respond to such a change. The “intended Projection”: A great resemblance with the immediately preceding technique is shown by the “active projection”.
