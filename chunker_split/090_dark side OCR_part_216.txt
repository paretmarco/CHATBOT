Problem states con- tinue to occur as the child within trance-fers his spiritualizing onto others. For example, the child imagines himself to be transparent and that the idealized guru/parent can see his every thought, or knows his real self. This is grandiosity in reverse. Here the child idealizes and trance-fers grandiose powers on another figure, making the person a superhuman God/guru, thus making the figure grandiose. Trance-fer of Values and Lessons In other forms of transpersonal transference, the child trance- fers parental values to God. Here the child develops the trance of transferring to God his parents' good/bad system, which the child has taken on to survive. Now, good actions (the ones Dad and Mom like) are what God wants. Bad actions become what God doesn't want. Parental punishment occurs when a child doesn't get some- thing from her parents. The parent says, "You're not getting this to learn a lesson." Years later, when the adult doesn't get something in life she wants, the infant/child within the adult uses spiritual reframes like, "God is trying to teach me a lesson."
