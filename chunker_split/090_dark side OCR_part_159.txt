The child learns that confusion is a powerful tool to push people away, to get space for himself or get taken care of. Let us imagine that the little boy, when asked to do anything, looks as if he doesn't quite understand. Dad then shows him how it is done. Next, Mom asks the little boy to change the light bulb in the lamp. The son acts bewildered and responds with a look of confusion. Mom then takes over and does the task. The well-known comedian Bill Cosby would say, that Dads know how to act stupid, knowing that the Mom will rescue them. Actually, it is the little boy inside of the man which has learned to act stupid to get Mom to do it for him. After a while a child learns that looking, acting, or being confused causes someone to take care of him. This is a classic example because, once placed on automatic, the confused act or identity appears real and is supported by the social or family network that reinforces its existence. This form of confusion is more situation oriented.
