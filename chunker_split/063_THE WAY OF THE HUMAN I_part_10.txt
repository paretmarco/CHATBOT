Once discarded these concepts are seen as just that, concepts, and then WHO YOU ARE naturally emerges and is revealed. However, you must have a willingness to question everything and not believe anything. It is a process whereby you find out who you are by finding out who you are not. The Quantum work is both a map and a de-programming guide to hopefully enable people to wake-up and go-beyond all they think they are to find out WHO THEY REALLY ARE. In the later stages both the questioner and questionee dissolve. What is beyond this? Nisargadatta Maharaj answered this question. When a student asked, "Who are you?" he said, "Nothing perceivable or conceivable." Enjoy the ride. With love Your brother, Stephen ________________ DEDICATION To the memory ofiny teacher and the Grandfather of Quantum Psychology, Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj ACKNOWLEDGMENTS To the memory of Alfred Korzybski, the Father of General Semantics To the memory of G.
