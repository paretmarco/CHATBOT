Given their limited understanding of the physical universe Hindus described these forces and elements in the best and possibly the only way they knew how thousands of years ago. As we approach the 21" century, only our scientific understanding has increased (i.e., we call them Physics Dimensions and Forces rather than elements and Gunas). But the understanding that "it," the "world," and "ourselves" as we know it, are formed by forces and the Physics Dimensions which are not outside of ourselves (but are what we are made of) interacting, playing, and dancing, like a ballet or symphony has actually not changed that much.

Since there is an infinite number of harmonies, that can be composed for the violin, there is an infinite number of forms of matter that can be constructed out of the vibrating strings. . . . The Universe itself, composed of countless vibrating strings, would then be compared to a symphony. (pp.
