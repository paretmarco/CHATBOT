Quantum Psychology calls this psychological compensating structure the False Self Compensator. The False Core is a psycho-emotional concept which acts like a covering over the Biological-Core. What Rolf calls the sleeve (compensating identities) is foreground, which can be biologically experienced as sore muscles. The BIOLOGICAL CORE remains an unexperienced background. However, when aligned with gravity, the BIOLOGICAL CORE becomes foreground and the sleeve background. What does this mean experientially? It is the experience of living out of your true BIOLOGI- 'At present the majority opinion in physics is that gravity is the major force corning out of the BIG BANG. There is, however, a minority opinion that the major force is Electromagnetic (Kaku, Hyperspace, 1992).
