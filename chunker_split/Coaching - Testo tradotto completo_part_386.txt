What it means is that its benefit can at best emerge at a later time, as a secondary spin-off, at the time, that is, when you will have learnt how to “create” such desire in yourselves, how to almost recite it out instead of being victims thereof.

When you are talking: Whenever you accost somebody, you should always make sure to look straight at him. You might legitimately look into his eyes, as well as at the base of his nose, at the space between his eyes, or at his glands. Besides, in the event that you need to stare at him for a long time, you might change the spot you are going to direct your look to, from one slightly above the eyes to another one slightly below them, taking care however not to stop looking at that person, at least not before you have completed the presentation to him of the proposal you would want him to accept.
