I said, "Are you a workaholic or did you fuse with your father who was a workaholic?" He said, "I fused with my father." The child within became Dad. The adult wants to spend time with his family. The child that fused with Dad's workaholism won't let him. This case was interesting because the father of my client was married to a woman who had several emotional breakdowns and was institution- alized. The father of my client became a workaholic to avoid seeing and dealing with his spouse. Not surprisingly, the child inside my client married a dysfunctional woman with severe emotional prob- lems, and the other side of the child within became a workaholic all outside of the observer's awareness. My client totally fused with and, like a xerox machine the observer, made a duplicate copy of Dad's trance. This is another dark side of the inner child taking on Dad' s identity. I've had clients who are depressed. I'll ask, "Are you depressed, or did you take on your Mom/Dad's depression to help Mom/Dad?" An observer created a child identity which thinks they can help Mom or Dad by taking on their pain.
