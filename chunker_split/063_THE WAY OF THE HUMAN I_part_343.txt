Stephen Johnson (1987) says it this way: In defense of that state, the narcissistic personality will go to extreme lengths to find mirroring objects or to coerce those he has into the desired response. The idealization of others which narcissists exhibit may be usefully conceptualized along the developmental continuum—merger, twinship, mirroring. In the merger transference, the individual will seek out and then rnispercieve the other as the perfect object with whom to merge. In ordinary life this perfection is most often sought in the potential mate—potential because it is nearly impossible to maintain idealization at close quarters. The individual is still looking for the symbiosis which was either insufficient or prematurely lost. (This is one phase of the guru/disciple trance which is the spiritualization of the mother). The perfect twin-ship is the idealization of the alter-ego transference, as seen in many adolescent love affairs. The perfect role model is the idealization of the mirroring transference. In this later developmental arrest, the individual needs someone to look up to, believe in, and emulate. (p. 52) LOOKING FOR A MODEL. Throughout my life, I have found both friends and trainees of mine who were looking for a role model.
