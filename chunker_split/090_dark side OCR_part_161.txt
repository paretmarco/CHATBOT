The child learns that by using certain words, talking over the adult's head, using or being a certain way, the adults remain bewildered, even stand- offish. This helps the child to feel powerful when they actually feel powerless. The child actually feels powerless, overwhelmed and confused and, in that confusion, the child decides to confuse others in order to feel powerful. There is an old axiom in Gestalt therapy that says, "Do unto others that which was done unto you." Let' s look at the last example in the possible light of one of the most powerful hypnotherapists in history, Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Erickson had polio and suffered strokes. He developed ways to help control pain and developed inner resources to survive. He then used these methods (do unto others) to help multitudes of people. One of Erickson' s major contributions to the field of hypnosis, according to Jeffery Zeig, Ph.D., was in the area of confusion. Erickson was not only a master of pain control, but a master of inducing confusion with clients.
