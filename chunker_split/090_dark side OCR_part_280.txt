Colin Willson from the foreword BRAMBLE â€¢BOOKS THE TAO OF CHAOS Essence and the Enneagram Quantum Consciousness, Volume II Stephen Wolinsky, Ph .D . ISBN 1-883647-02-9, $16.95, 359 Pages n The Tao ofChaos Wolinsky gives us a path to our essential nature by allowing chaos to be the rule rather than the exception. A process whereby chaos becomes our friend, a familiar experience, a welcome home or even a fuel to bring us back to our universal self. Wolinsky shows us that dysfunc- tional personality is created as a resistance to chaos. All of our efforts to order chaos through resisting it by creating more and more systems to manage it have fallen short. It appears obvious that a personality born of chaos and resistance to chaos can only beget more chaos and resistance. The Tao of Chaos is about looking at our most resisted experience and finding that chaos is no longer an enemy but a friend. Exercises throughout the book will ask you to experience your chaos and by "getting to know" it you will "get to know" the essence of your real self. This book is brilliant and it has fantastic and wonderful insights. I shall go back to it again and again.
