He needs to learn repeatedly but gently that he is not omnipotent and that he cannot do or have anything he wants simply because he wants it. (Ibid., pp. 30-31.) 255 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Unfortunately again, often teachers or gurus and spiritual systems do not allow this to occur. Even worse, their philosophy reinforces the infantile structure of premature merging by offering statements such as, "The guru and I are one." What we must appreciate in this statement of oneness is that, yes, it's true, we are one. The problem is that we must acknowledge and appreciate our animal nature and psycho-emotional nature, along with our Quantum Nature. Otherwise, premature merging is based on arrested development and trances, with their accompanying infantile understandings which yield individual pain. The Way of the Human asks us to separate and be a mature individual. Then by becoming that individual human, one can stabilize their experience in the world as they move into ESSENCE and, ultimately, into Quantum Consciousness.
