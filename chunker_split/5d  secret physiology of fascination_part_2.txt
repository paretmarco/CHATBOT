This phenomenon happens in fascination, where the face of the operator become big and can even be a sign of entering a specific state as it is physiological as well psychological as it touches what we call "dimension" of an object, that is also a psychological construction. For exemple, a six floors building occupies on the retina the same space as an object near, yet we are able to judge its size, even with an eye closed. There is also a physiological correlate: the more distant the individual' s dark focus, the greater his or her tendency to focus beyond an acuity target and to maximize apparent size. This will create a greater discrimination of detail. In fact judgnents of apparent size are highly correlated with visual accommodation distance, and in aviation it has been proved that the difficulty of detecting airplanes on stationary collision courses is greatly aggravated when focus is trapped by structure close to the eyes.
