Doctor Lombroso (the celebrated insanity expert, himself insane) affirms to have seen a hypnotized woman read through her tees without the aid of her eyes; to have made a medical student write music, of which he knew not a note; and another student speak German correctly, a language of which he was entirely ignorant. As the two students mentioned were patients formed by myself, I made inquiries of them and they informed me that they knew perfectly both music and the German language, and that, besides, Doctor Lombroso went through his experiments without method, without sincerity and with a brutality of which the subjects suffered and complained. The newspapers have for a long time resounded with accounts of the famous experiments of Doctor Luys, member of the Academy of Medicine, on the influence of medicaments enclosed in glass tubes and acting at a distance on two hypnotized women at the hospital of La Charity. I denied these facts energetically. They were submitted to an academic commission who declared them false in every particular. Doctor Luys had been duped by his two patients, who had tried to render themselves interesting.
