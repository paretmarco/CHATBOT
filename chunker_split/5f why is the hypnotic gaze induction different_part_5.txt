Fascination can for example be very useful for getting immediate answers from the inner part of our mind. What does it really happen during this kind of hypnotic gaze induction? Firstly, there is a profound change in perception. The ancient spoke of "mist". In this mist the subject often experiments an immediate trance, he feels removed from time and the material world. Why? Scientifically expressed, the fascinated subject immediately experiments various visual hallucinations as the focus of his eyes goes to a particular point called "dark focus" or "resting point of focusing". As your eyes focalize there, your mind goes in a sort of natural vacation and you do not recognise far and near any more. The "dark focus" is a phenomenon scientifically observed in aviators, who, sometimes, enter a sort of "trance", very dangerous while flying. It is like a physiological "black point", wired in our brain, where our perceptions change. This is a first difference with mainstream verbal hypnosis that, being psychologically oriented, does not rely on this kind of physiological reaction. A second change is also a natural and spontaneous development of catalepsy, similar to the tonic immobility of animals.
