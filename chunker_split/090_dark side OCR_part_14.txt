Many Prologue : therapies would at that point introduce a new belief, for example, "It's okay to trust men," or, "People do love me." The intention of these therapies is to "heal the inner child." What I propose is dramatically different. Quantum Psychology The first tenet of Quantum Psychology is that subjective, internal reality is observer-created. You, as the observer of a trauma, take a picture of it, hold it, merge with it, go to sleep, and then go on the same tape-loop ride over and over again. Quantum Psychology says that you, (the observer), hold and create the inner-child memory in response to a trauma. To clarify, the observer does not create the outer event. The ob- server creates it's response to the outer event. Therefore, the observer, who has fallen asleep and fused with the memory, must be awakened so that the memory can be let go of by the ob- server. That picture that is given the power is a memory that you (the observer) are holding.
