This involves first, identification with and, later, hatred for the parent of the same sex, who is considered by the child as a rival. (American College Dictionary, pg. 840) How does this apply? A married couple comes to a Guru and age-regresses and spiritualizes the Guru/Dad, next, the Guru age- regresses and makes the married couple into his mom and dad. Next, the age-regressed Guru, does what he can to inter-fear with the couple, so he can have the woman, (Mom) for himself. In India, this used to be called left-handed shaktipat. Shaktipat is a term used to describe initiation by a Guru. In left-handed shaktipat, the Guru initiates the husband and wife, and then tries to, or sleeps with the wife. This age-regression by the guru and age-regression and spiritu- alization by the disciples, has done great damage to both individuals and couples. Unfortunately this occurs, and even more unfortu- nately, the Guru's behavior is spiritualized rather than being confronted and seen as the age-regressed trance of a perpetrator. The Spiritual Lesson Reframe and Trance As children we are all given reasons why things occur.
