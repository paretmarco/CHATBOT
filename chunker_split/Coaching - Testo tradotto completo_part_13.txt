learning how to eliminate all the wasteful slag, the useless actions, thoughts and words, which fill up our life and wrest time from us. We must first know how to be ourselves, simply ourselves, and only thereafter we should target an action. The initial work is the one that is carried out on the mental aspect: Every useless thought steals away some vital force, mental clarity and time. We should likewise view unnecessary repeated thoughts as being divested of any usefulness: How many times should we keep on formulating a particular resolution in our minds? For the successful person, it is enough if he says to himself, ‘Do!’ just once, as he then acts upon that self-injunction. As for the person who cannot produce results, he tells himself a thousand times that he should be doing something, without ever getting to do it at all. If you become conscious of that, you will discover that a large part of what you used to do was of no use whatsoever, and that it merely consumed some of your energy. It is not only thoughts which rob us of energy. Emotions, too, rob us our time and freeze it.
