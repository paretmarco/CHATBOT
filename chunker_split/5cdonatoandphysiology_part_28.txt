To the subjects, who had just been giving every evidence of suffering from cold, I suggested that they were suffering from an excess of tropical heat. They mopped their foreheads and removed their coats. A respect for truth incites me to say here that in this experiment the subjects are not always really warm; however in all cases the phenomena are subjective and not objective. Boxing is an act of simple suggestion. The dentist scene is more complicated. A subject suffers with toothache (suggested sensation). He goes to the dentist, sits in the chair and opens his mouth (suggested action). A second subject believes to be a dentist himself (suggested idea) and goes through the motion of extracting the bad tooth. The other photographs represent different phases of suggested crime. It must be confessed it is only simulated, for the alleged dagger is a roll of newspaper. This gives rise to a formidable question. Would it be possible to bring about a veritable crime in real life, instead of an imaginary crime in a theatre or hospital? I do not hesitate to reply no, a thousand times no! Hypnotism, all powerful for good, is disarmed for evil.
