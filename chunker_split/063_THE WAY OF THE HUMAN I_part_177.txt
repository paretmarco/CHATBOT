You might get Rolfed forever, it doesn't mean it is going to handle your relationship issues. Meet the problem at the level of the problem or refer them to someone who can work with them at that level. If someone has a bad back, yes, maybe we can cure it with prayer. But it might be wiser to see a chiropractor, a Feldenkrais practitioner or a Rolfer. Quantum Psychology feels that there is a danger in giving someone a philosophy which they cannot take in. For example, if someone has their attention on their False Core and you tell them something like, "YoU are not the doer," that statement only gets superimposed onto their False Core. The philosophy cannot go in, it can only be used to reinforce their False Core (see Volume II). Each dimension has a different function. It's the function of the thinking dimension to think. It's a function of the emotional dimension to have emotions. It's the function of the biological dimension to shit. It makes as much sense to say sexual abstinence will lead you to God as not going to the bathroom will lead you to God.
