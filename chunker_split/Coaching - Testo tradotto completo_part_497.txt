The most common emotional reactions which might debar a trader from attaining his goals are five in number: FEAR: Fear lowers oneâ€™s propensity to take risks, and it especially has the effect of "closing up" the mind. Every thing we focus upon is enlarged by our focus. When you experience fear, therefore, you must gather your mind on the business risk and mentally exaggerate its probable negative consequences. In addition, the emotion of fear causes us to engage in reasoning processes which, in the short term, are exclusively linear; it has therefore the tendency of inhibiting "lateral thinking", which is of higher calibre. As trading is an issue of OPPORTUNITIES, and opportunities are normally the fruit harvested by lateral thinking, a natural corollary of the aforesaid is that we lose out on the best opportunities. That has sometimes the effect of occasioning the conclusion of sales at unsuitable times, those times where we know with near-mathematical certainty that a market is going to "bounce back". Fear additionally narrows the temporal horizon. In such instances, the average trader ends up focusing his attention on an extremely circumscribed time horizon.
