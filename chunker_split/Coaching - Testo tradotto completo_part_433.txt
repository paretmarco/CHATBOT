Let us think of how a mother or a father communicates an idea to a child when dealing with him. The subject wants us to address him either in a passive or in an authoritative manner. The passive manner is the maternal one. Having a rapport with the subject is an essential prerequisite for resorting to the utilization of this mechanism. The authoritative manner is more fatherly in nature. Having prestige is a fundamental prerequisite to the adoption of this different mechanism. Let us picture the way in which father figures are perceived. They appear to be bigger and more powerful than the child. The keys to prestige and status are forever to be sought in being big and strong, as well in being wise and powerful. The magnetic person knows how to acquire prestige in a non-verbal fashion, without at the same time activating critical resistance and forms of opposition in the other person, inasmuch as the magnetic individual only acts on the strength of non-verbal tools. In particular, due to the fact that the magnetic attitude is not easily captured and forced into a restrictive frame, it tends to create a favourable setting for projections.
