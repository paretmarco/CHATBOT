It is however imperative that the look should really settle on the objects which it turns to for a sufficiently long period to enable it to recognize them, whereupon you should detach your look from any such object at once in order to direct it firmly, in the selfsame manner, on some object situated on the opposite side. 2. III. â€“ EXPRESSION OF THE LOOK It is by now an empirically demonstrated fact that the intense and constant desire to perfect some demarcated sensory organ or specific faculty is truly capable of substantially improving it. If such reality might seem to be dubious with regard to the lower senses, it is nevertheless indisputable and even intelligible when it comes to the sight, and even more when we turn to the expression of the eye. The expression of our eyes reflects, in a precise and unconscious manner, the state of our inner cores, exactly as a placid surface of water reflects the condition of the sky above. As a result, whereas the lip is capable of a lie, it is quite difficult for the eyes to lie. When we fix our gaze on something that is ardently desired or vehemently loathed, our eyes naturally become expressive.
