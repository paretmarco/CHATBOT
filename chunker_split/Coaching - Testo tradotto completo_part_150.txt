Intuitively, if one smashes an object due to the impulse of an emotion (which is what occurs to several people), that generates in him a physical-psychological reaction. It is a physical one because of the effort, and the noise produced by the corpus which is smashed; and it also psychological, by virtue of the state of surprise which soon descends, together with the feeling of remorse over the self-inflicted harm. From a psychological perspective, there are people who react by unleashing a temperamental outburst against some scapegoat, by resorting to listening to some stormy music, or by walking out, meeting people, doing something harmlessly eccentric etc. There are better and more suitable methods available, however. The under-mentioned exercise is quite useful in this connection: Exercise 28 â€“ Offload emotions through movement. Identify the point in your body where you experience the emotion (anger or worry). Bring the eyes to a point of ocular convergence. Let the emotion guide your body in the way it moves and shakes. Go on doing that until the emotion is vanished.
