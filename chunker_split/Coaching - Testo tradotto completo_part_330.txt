Nevertheless — as we should reiterate once more — “acting naturally” is a means to an end rather than an end in itself. It serves the purpose of diminishing the straining effort necessitated by a voluntary action, though it still depends at all times on a higher level of presencing. The master of his own destiny will always be the conscious individual. It is this self-presencing which, now and then, will advice us to break the voluntary action through an automatism which can be no less detrimental than it is convenient. Many people in fact relinquish the conscious state and self-presencing, and accordingly fall into sheer machine-like behaviour, leading them to discover in automatism the secret of an easy and useless life. The intelligent man, by contrast, must always allow his reason’s critique to occupy the pre-eminent place which it is rightfully entitled to. That critique will occasionally counsel him to engage in a salutary rebellion against automatism elevated into the guiding norm of both our personal and social conduct. By means of such healthy rebellion to it, the critical reason will push our conduct towards new and demanding roads which ultimately lead us to our own progress.
