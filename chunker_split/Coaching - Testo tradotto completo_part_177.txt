With regard to this category of people, there is no purposeful quest for something better, and no search of one’s true life “vocation”. As for the loftier type of man, he can discern a higher ideal which is intellectual, aesthetic, family-related, or social. In his regard, living denotes the following: Building something, being active. This construction work springs out of an impulse linking him to the Universe. A man of this nature is inclined to reach an ever vaster understanding, to feel his self as being a conscious element within an increasingly larger environment. A man who is endowed with a goal might only be an unhappy fellow because, under the influence of other people, he has relinquished realization of that correspondence which binds him to his intrinsic nature. Otherwise, he cannot fail to be an optimist. This concept of having a direction, a purpose, an ideal, is equally present in a philosopher, an artist or a merchant. Every division of men into men of thought and man of action is artificial.
