According to physics, before the BIG BANG and the creation of the universe, everything was NOTHING, THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. When the universe cooled the different Physics Dimensions were formed. In other words, imagine energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces as cooled parts of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, all of them now differentiating and exerting a "force" upon each other, and interacting with each other.
