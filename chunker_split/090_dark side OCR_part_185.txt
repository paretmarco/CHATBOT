What did you (the inner child), decide to know about the past? 4. What did you (the inner child), decide to not know about the past? You hold a volume of information; one way to break beliefs about what you can and can't remember is to ask ... and notice what occurs. Conclusion Understanding that both amnesia and hypermnesia are reac- tions to environmental, unwanted, family situations, makes it easy to undo the not knowing (denial) and expand the knowing. This gives you more choice or range in the experiences of the world and allows the resources of your past to open to you. Once the past is open, an individual can use it as a resource library of forgotten material, which can be taken into the present and future.

Removing the not knowing provides more energy in present-time with which to know and be creative. â€¢13 Sensory Distortion: I Can't Feel As soon as you're born they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.
