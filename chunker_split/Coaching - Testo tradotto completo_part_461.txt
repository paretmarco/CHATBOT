“Earning a lot” is, instead, an expression marred by the fact that it is “indeterminate” in nature. When our mind hears the word “a lot”, it has no knowledge of what it means. Let us try and be more exact. What is it that, precisely, we wish to accomplish? “Earning quickly”, too, suffers from being a phrase marked by indefinite semantic contours. Besides, the trader who sets out on the basis of that premise runs a greater risk to fall into stress than his colleagues, given that he will lean to the side of doing things “hastily”. If the trader who thinks in that manner fails to achieve any result, we might then be tempted to feel that whoever follows a different kind of reasoning, for instance by having in mind the goal of earning the right figure, within the right time span, and with a consumption of energies which is suitably commensurate with that purpose, is more likely to accomplish his desires, especially if what is meant (even from a numerical point of view) by the word “right” is clearly etched in his mind.
