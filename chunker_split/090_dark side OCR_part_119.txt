What must be understood is that, although the fogging 74 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child out helped the child survive, it did not work 100%. Some part of the child saw the assault. This creates an inner child with two sides, side one fogs out, and side two sees the assault. The time frozen-inner child automatically re-creates the trance that worked in the past, not seeing. Carrying it over into present time, the adult is simulta- neously attracted to a famil-(iar) scene, battering. In the former case, even though the adult wants to make contact, the inner child keeps blocking-out. Ideally, blocking-out should be like a sun screen. If I go to the beach and am able to choose the degree of exposure I want by picking the right level of sun screen, I am at choice. But, if I can't get the protection I want, I am at the mercy of the sun, or the dark side of an out-of-control, wounded inner child. It should be noted again, that women who choose men that batter either saw Mom being battered or were battered, themselves. Thus the trance of blocking-out is not a solution.
