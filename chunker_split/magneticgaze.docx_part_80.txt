Let us for instance observe an anguished person: He does not seem to pay attention to the external environment, so caught as he is in his private anxieties. Average man fears the unknown and prefers to live inside a prison cell rather than opening himself up to the uncertainty of what is novel. Such a person will then live cocooned inside his own world which, though often disagreeable, is at least familiar. There is an intrinsic tendency in man which urges him to escape chaos, the unknown. The reason why people, therefore, walk into a state of "intrapersonal trance" is essentially related to self-defence from the outside environment and the desire to avoid facing reality. This “dream” inclines to self-manifestation, on account of the fact that by shunning the task of confronting reality we are also barred from changing. In an essential sense, we go on behaving in conformity with schemes which have been learnt in the past. An example of that might consist in a child who learns how to relate to his parents in a specific manner, and who, as he grows up, insists on behaving himself with all and sundry in the same manner.
