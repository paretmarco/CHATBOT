The person can decide which behavior to modify, having at hand all the necessary tools with which to change. Although when necessary, especially at the beginning, this should be done with the help of the operator. Erickson, the best hypnotist of our times, never solved a problem in the traditional way. His way of applying therapy was astonishing. He used revolutionary techniques that were extremely efficient and he used different methods on different people, so that for a long time it was not possible to write anything about him or identify him with a particular type of therapy as had happened with other psychoanalysts. He agreed that he did not have a particular method; he compared himself to an artist and said, “When an artist paints he needs to be inspired. The same thing happens to me when I find myself faced with a problem. I decide in that moment what to do”. In each case the most important element in Erickson’s therapeutic practice was his use of instructive stories, anecdotes and riddles, for example, to overcome habitual limits, he used stories to expand peoples’ minds. THE BASIC METHOD USED BY Erickson in therapy was the “Symptom Prescription”, creating the way for small changes that were seen as the problem uptil that moment. It is something that prevents development, therefore, a behavior that springs up independently from will is prescribed at this point. Thus, the mind processes everything in a different way and the symptom or block goes away.
