For example, if I had a marriage problem and went to a priest, he might say the problem was spiritual; an accountant would say economic; a body worker, "It's in your structure"; a psychotherapist, "It has to do with Mom and Dad"; a family therapist, "It's in the context," etc. For this reason, we must learn to become more open to the fact that no one system handles it all. See the level the client needs to work on and be willing to refer them to an appropriate person. This is part of the art of a therapist or spiritual teacher. In the ancient Sufi tradition, a Sufi master would send individuals to different teachers so that the student could get the help they needed. This demonstrates that not only does one system not work for everybody or everything but one master's teaching does not work for everybody either. These Sufi masters made the student's "progress" the center of their approach and work, not their own personal desire to teach. This is client- or student-centered work. Unfortunately, nowadays when people go to a teacher or guru, they all get the same techniques.
