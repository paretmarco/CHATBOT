For example, many women whom I have worked with and know, have said that their husbands expect them to give them everything they want, whenever they want it without their having to ask. These age-regressed men are trance-ferring magical mommy onto their wife or partner. The "good enough" mother is a little different in Quantum Psychology. Here, the "good enough" mother can mirror ESSENCE and essential qualities, not just personality. In order to do this, the mother must be able to acknowledge her own ESSENCE and being. This allows her to acknowledge the ESSENCE and being of her child, while simultaneously differentiating the child's ESSENCE from the child's identities while simultaneously realizing their underlying connection at the level of the underlying unity. For example, rather than the mother fusing together ESSENCE and personality when the child misbehaves by saying, "You are bad," the mother can let the child know, overtly or covertly, that what they are doing is not okay, even while their ESSENCE and who they really are is untouched and perfect.
