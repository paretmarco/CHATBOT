Seen from the trader’s point of view, he needs to have faith in his instinct, which is something that might represent an advantage, provided it springs out of experience. In quantum terms, this ensures us that the "quantum register is filled out thoroughly". Essentially, what we are stating is that it is possible to optimize the process by which "intuitive acumen" might be created in a person. We might, in other words, optimize our capacity to respond. In that case, it suits us to gather all the possible information about a particular subject, and to subsequently allow our intuitive elaboration to be set in motion. In this instance, too, an important role is played by “knowing not to know”. One of the main enemies of intuition is "to want things to proceed along a specific direction". We must in other words avoid the trap of our hopes possibly interfering with the process we have just described here above. In trading we can thus apply the so-called "dynamics of intuition”: Collecting information – phase of unconscious elaboration - gathering solutions – putting them into practice or critically refuting them.
