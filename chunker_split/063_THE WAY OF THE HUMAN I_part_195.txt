From the ultimate point of view, using quantum physics, the entire body is made up of the same one substance, namely, different densities of solidness which serve different functions. In this way, thoughts, sensations, and emotions are made up ultimately of the same substance as the liver or bones, just with different densities and different functions. This means that the body is not connected to the mind, but rather, the body is the mind, there is no separation, Hence, Nisargadatta Maharaj called it the body-mind because at the biological level the biology (body) came first, and the "mind" (thoughts, interpretations, emotions, etc.) came later. For this reason and to make it even clearer we will now refer to it as the body---+mind. As we go onto the thinking process we will further discuss beliefs, images, etc. which emerge from, and are a by-product of, the nervous system. THE ORIGIN OF CONCEPTS The purpose of this discussion is to see the organism as a whole, and yet not to go to the other extreme and make the body more important than the mind.
