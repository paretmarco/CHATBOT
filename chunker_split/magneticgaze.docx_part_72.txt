One of these techniques, for example, consists in fixing the so-called third eye. Another, preparatory technique, is based on staring at one’s nose. It has been noticed by some people that, given the excessive closeness of the point thus fixed, adjustment generally proves insufficient to enable a clear vision, notwithstanding the contraction. The surrounding objects end up occupying only the peripheral part of the retina, due to the central part thereof being occupied. Peripheral sensations are weaker than those that are felt at the centre. In those conditions, the subject turns almost blind to the outside world, and the more the internal deflection of the eyes is increased, the more the process gains effectiveness. 9. The void One might be tempted to ask why so much effort should be put on casting the outside objects out of one’s focus. It is however possible to detect a useful aspect in that endeavour. It paralyzes one’s will. It also paralyzes the attention which, if it happens to settle on one object only, is inclined to forget the others.
