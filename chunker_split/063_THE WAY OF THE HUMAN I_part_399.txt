The outcome of their bizarre association was the hideous monster who was half-man and half-bull. King Minos asked Daedalus to build a Labyrinth in which to confine the Minotaur and demanded that Athens pay an annual tribute of seven youths (virgins) and seven maidens (virgins) to satisfy the monster's huge appetite. Minos eventually found out that Daedalus had been instrumental in bringing about the union between his wife and the bull and threw the architect and his son into the Labyrinth. Daedalus made wings from feathers stuck together with wax and wearing these, father and son made their getaway. His son Icarus flew to close too the sun, the wax on the wings melted, and he plummeted into the sea off the Island of Ikaria. Athenians meanwhile were enraged by the tribute demanded by Minos. The Athenian hero, Theseus, vowed to kill the Minotaur and sailed off the Crete posing as one of the sacrificial youths (virgins). On arrival he fell in love with Ariadne, the daughter of King 262 Appdendix Minos, and she promised to help him if he would take her away with him afterward.
