As we look inwardly into our lives and "outwardly" at the world, it becomes apparent that we share not only a "biological -being together" but also a "psychological-being-together." We not only share those things about which we are "collectively aware" but also those things of which we are "collectively unaware."

"First", THE VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum Psychology CONSCIOUSNESS contracts to form the Physics Dimensions of energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, and strong and weak forces along with the ideas of distance and location.
