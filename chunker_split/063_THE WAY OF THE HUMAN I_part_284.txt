Take the label off of both of them and allow them both to be energy and an archetypical struggle. Now notice the EMPTINESS they are floating in. See the energy and trace the energy back to the EMPTINESS. Where does it trace to? It's like fire itself. Like a log burning, fire, almost like lightning. Now trace it back to the EMPTINESS. How are you doing now? Just fine It's a different feeling of energy in my body. There is a peacefulness with it. I moved to if I feel that energy, I will alienate my mother and then I will die. I think that I stuffed upon that realization, I stuffed that energy. How are you doing now? Nothing. How does primal energy feel in your pelvis now? Its just kind of warm in there. It's just right there. I feel wonderful. I feel very peaceful. It's very simple. Where I feel the energy is up here in my shoulders, especially this one. Notice where, if anywhere, the hood and clamping down is right now.
