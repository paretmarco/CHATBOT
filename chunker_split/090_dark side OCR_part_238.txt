Problems arise for the adult because the child within does not let in information contrary to the system, thus freezing the child within the adult. The world becomes familiar and stable but rigid, boring and robotic. It is the resistance to chaos emptiness or unexplainability of life that creates systems that organize chaos, and keep age-regressed inner children creating worlds that limit ours and others' freedom. 5. Inner World Trances of the Dark Side of the Inner Child: Gods and Goddesses. For those of us who were unable to idealize parents or make them into gods, comes a different third level trance state, an internalized, idealized Mom/Dad and the inner-God trance. For example in the case of a wounded child who cannot idealize his external mother as "all-powerful," "all- good," or "all-knowing" comes a new and improved trance: creating an inner world. Ideal- ized Moms/Dads become "inner gods," or "inner goddesses." In Eastern cultures, worship of the inner mother, goddess or Devi is prescribed to handle the ills of life. Certainly most religious systems ask you to find the God within.
