QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Substituting a "psychological want" for a biological need yields an obsessive-compulsive action, desire and reaction and no satisfaction. 127 The Way of the Human 4. Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Quantum Psychology says that there are two other major biological have-to 's: (1) the merger response, i.e., the biological desire to merge at one of the dimensions; and (2) the learning response, i.e., at a biological level, a drive to learn at greater and greater levels of differentiation and complexity. As with the other four biological drives, any thwarting of the merger or learning response yields a biological deprivation and shock. The fourth dimension of manifestation is the body. Our body comprises our animal nature eating, sleeping, shitting, sexuality, libido (the desire to merge)â€”and learning at greater levels of complexity. Often we lose awareness of our physical body. For example, in a workshop, I once met a woman who was not in her body. She was not around her body. She was not even aware of what she was saying.
