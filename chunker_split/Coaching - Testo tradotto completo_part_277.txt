That is due to the fact that, in that way, such operations are going to be carried out in a sequential order, whereas, otherwise, there might be a tendency to postpone the more complex actions sine die. Having recourse to the method of writing, we will mark down in the morning the sequential order in which the first operations of the day will have to be carried out. In the event of the supervening emergence of some new operation for the day, such new operation will be noted down below the list of the other operations. It might possibly happen that this operation which has been noted down last will be required to be carried out prior to some of the previously listed ones. The said numbering of it would then only serve the purpose of marking its natural place, that is to say, the most suitable moment to execute it. Other people might draw advantage from the stratagem of simply noting down, in the apposite small column, the hour in which each operation has to be carried out, as opposed to its sequential number. One is after all dealing with one and the same concept, namely, how to demarcate the right place for every particular operation.
