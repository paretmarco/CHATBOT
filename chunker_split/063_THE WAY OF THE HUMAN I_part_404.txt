In order to outsmart Poseidon (the undivided mind), Minos (the higher self or ESSENCE) destroys an image of the bull (something that looks like sex) but not the Bull itself. Here we see how we misunderstand pure sexuality as a natural biological impulse and an expression of the unified whole. We confuse this natural biological impulse and believe that it's the same as our images or ideas about sex rather than seeing it as natural and part of the whole. In this way, through our images of sex we -y to destroy it by labeling it as bad. Recently I met a guru wannabe who labeled sex as a trance rather than seeing her ideas about sex as a trance and sex as a natural biological function. Briefly stated, we create images of sexuality which are not sex. We then try to destroy our natural impulses because of the images we have created, causing further division" within us. In revenge, Poseidon causes Minos' wife Pasaphae to fall in love with the Bull. In other words, King Minos (ESSENCE) does not see a separation between himself and sexuality. He tries to outsmart the attempt of the mind to divide itself.
