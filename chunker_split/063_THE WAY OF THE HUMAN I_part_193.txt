Often clients respond, "I don't feel that in my body, I feel it in my head." I respond with, "When did you decide that your head was not your body?" Often the viewpoint of separation and splitting are not questioned since it is assumed that the description of an experience is the experience itself. But as Alfred Korzybski stated, "The map is not the territory." The problem, therefore, not the solution, is structuralization when people think that the map (description) of their experience is the territory (or their experience). This is caused when the mind is seen as more important than the body. Even Freud disagreed with this when he said that "the ego is body centered" (i.e., it is a by-product of the body). Quantum Psychology states that, not only is the map not the territory, but the story or description is not the state or experience. The description of a state or experience comes out of the body-mind and is the way the nervous system, later and after the experience has already taken place, creates a story to organize itself and to avoid the chaos of certain experiences.
