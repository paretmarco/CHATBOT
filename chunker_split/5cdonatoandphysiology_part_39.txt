It is to observe that the sense of rotation matters and as we do a circular movement we tend to excite our mind in a specific way EXCITING THE UNCONSCIOUS Central and Peripheral Vision If you divide our brain into the conscious and subconscious, you could say that cone (central) vision is processed consciously, whereas rod (peripheral) vision is processed subconsciously. At most times, your subconscious mind functions in the background, sifting through huge streams of information for your conscious mind to consider. There are two components of the visual system, focal (fovea) vision and ambient (peripheral) vision. Focal vision is primarily responsible for object recognition, and ambient vision is primarily responsible for spatial orientation. Peripheral vision is good at detecting motion (a feature of rod cells) so movement we do will be recognized and help in fascinating Focal Vision. Focal vision is limited to the central two degrees of vision (i.e., the fovea) and is primarily a conscious function. Focal vision allows one to see clearly in order to recognize objects and read displays. However, since it requires conscious thought, it is a relatively slow process.
