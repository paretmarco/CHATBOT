One day, he took the resolution to start doing some trading in selected shares, by investing a small sum of money in them. The said decision was reached during a summer holiday by the sea, after a chat he had with a friend of his. The image of his friend who successfully managed his personal savings while he was comfortably seated by the sea shore facing a financial newspaper got etched in his mind. He was still blissfully unaware of which one might be for him the “right” way of satisfactorily working in that field. He asked himself: “What can I do so as to earn money while trading in the financial markets?” His mind began to set itself on an active mode, while the experiences he managed to accumulate took him to an increasingly higher level of knowledge. The tools which might be used in the market are an ocean, but they all share the feature that they are created for us. Each person accordingly finds the instrument which works best for him. In order to know which one it is, of course, you have to be able to buy them.
