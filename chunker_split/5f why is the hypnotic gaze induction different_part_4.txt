We discovered it was not a single technique, but the tip of an iceberg: a complete system with its self-hypnosis, its therapy and a serie of steps of practice. If we had not carried out these researches these secrets would have survived only in the ancient tales or in their worst part, in the criminal approach. There are still some people, mostly in Italy and Russia, who are using states similar to those induced by fascination for hypnotic theft. These same techniques instead can be very useful for human growth. Most researchers agree that the state of fascination is different from what is intended with the current clinical verbal hypnosis, even if in some elements both techniques can overlap. As many readers of this article will already know the verbal school of clinical hypnosis we will explain here some of the differences between the two systems. For any hypnotist it is very helpful to know the secrets behind fascination, as one of our duties as practitioners is to use any technique which would prove useful to help individuals change and recover their true self as well as their psychosomatic balance; and many times with fascination we can get to these results faster and stronger.
