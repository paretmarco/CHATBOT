The vision of the more or less rapid varying degrees of lights and colours ends with the perception of a complete darkness where the conscience of the operator seems. to dissolve. DREAMS If the individual is capable to persist, and not to retract, and even intensify the strength of the experiment, then, gradually, in absolute darkness one may be able to see of forming a small slight bright center. This will gradually shine until it will take over the dark. So a wonderful new world will open up to the human perception that if it can be satiated by many splendours and magnificent things, must also stay firm, impassible before the monstruosities and horrors without a name that you could see. CONTINUING THE PATH But the trials and dangers have not stopped, the goal is still far away and the path becomes increasingly difficult. Hallucinations of many types could be seen and we transcend near a dream world, but we must absolutely not fall inside it. Other observations of a more profound and interior level need to be done, especially noting a vague feeling of vertigo already slightly experienced in earlier stages. The operator must in the first steps fight it and dominate it, then at a succesive step a change of perception will be necessary, and the only possibility is to let it be there to persist and being beyond it. Feeling it in a slight and barely noticeable way. This requires that the will operates in a very particular way, maintaining a sense of power and passivity, a sense of firm and tenacious immobility.
