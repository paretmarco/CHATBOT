Such work is alternated by it with a moment where the logical mind is granted some rest: You must look at one point on the wall, and imagine yourself capable of hurling some small arrows toward that point (Please refrain from blinking your eyes). After a short while, you will notice that this exercise helps you increase your will, and that it develops firmness of determination and self-confidence in lifeâ€™s different situations. Be relaxed when you carry out the exercises. Whatever is bereft of a clearly defined purpose is no more than sheer agitation. It is purely tension of no avail. As such, it belongs to the redundant being generated by a state of neglect. Neglect consists in lack of desire or absence of interest in anything. If we truly desire something, we decide to direct our mind towards it. Were such a tenet to be scrupulously adhered to, no further rule would essentially be of any benefit. However, it is hardly likely that an individual, whose wont is to abandon his self to the wave of spontaneous associations of ideas, will be able to restrain himself. He consequently needs a specific education.
