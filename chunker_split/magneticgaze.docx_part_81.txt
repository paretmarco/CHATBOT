Assuming for instance that his parents were accustomed to shout at him and that he used to react by entering a state of block, he might then display an identical reaction vis-à-vis a traffic policeman who wants to issue him with a fine for a road-related infringement. Traditional psychology sometimes refers to this form of conduct by the term “projection”. In the example we have just mentioned, such variety of psychology would contend that the subject “projects” onto the member of the traffic cops the image he had of his own parents. We can observe that the initial comportment is born within an “interpersonal” ambit, or, said it in another manner, it is as if a model of perceiving reality were to “become solidly enrooted” in the relevant person. When we are small, we have a greater tendency to be in reality than at a more adult age. Our patterns of behaviour often originate in the shape of interpersonal trances, and later transmute into intrapersonal trances. In other words, we learn behavioural modes and reactions from other people and from the surrounding milieu in which we grow, and we subsequently appropriate them as part of our own modus operandi.
