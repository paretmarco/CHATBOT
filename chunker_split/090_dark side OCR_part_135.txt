Illusions that initially had a specific, external trigger (like the uncle), become problems as the trance is generalized to all men. This process is stimulated by the inner child focusing on the trigger, the left eye. Another example is the woman who was molested as a child. The adult goes into a "don't trust" trance, even in an environment that is pleasant. Illusioning also is witnessed within families or 84 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child couples that co-create survival illusions together, keeping the family together. For example, a dysfunctional family might continually illusion themselves as fine, upstanding citizens and present themselves to the community that way. In many cases of incest or child abuse, the family creates this world view with a "Father Knows Best" illusion. In this television show, Jim was the perfect dad, little Kathy was a good girl, and Bud was a mischievous son. In real life, however, Jim was alcoholic and had several failed attempts at suicide. Kathy was sexually abused, and Bud had a drug addiction problem. Unfortu- nately, family members are asked to block out the uncomfortable and opt for the illusion of the positive image.
