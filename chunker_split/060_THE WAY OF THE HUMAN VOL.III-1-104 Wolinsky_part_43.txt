35 Woiinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: The Way of the Human 4 Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter I I think I have spent a huge portion of my life trying to be in some way to create trauma or bigger than life so I know I exist. ________________ So this is all in resistance to non-existence. Yeah. And regarding this structure that I have to keep my mother there so she gives energy to me, and I give energy to her and so on, so that "I exist," how have you deceived yourself?
