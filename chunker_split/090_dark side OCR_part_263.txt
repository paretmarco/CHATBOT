"When I meet somebody, I always feel like they reject me. I feel I am less than them, that I am unworthy." The man talked about going to the herb store before the session. There was a man behind the counter he knows. He moved in front of the man, and he started to feel unworthy, like he had to impress him. So what did I write down? "Unworthy, impressâ€”I'm not good enough," which was his inner dialogue. I asked, "What triggers this response, what about this man at the herb store triggers this? Is it his posture, is it the way his legs are? Is it the way his mouth is held? Nose? Is he looking away? Is his neck turned? What is it?" Patient:"His eyes." Stephen: "His left eye or his right eye?" Patient:"His left eye." Stephen: "What part of his left eye?" Patient:"The part that wrinkles below the eye." Stephen: "What part of the face do you imagine is most accepting? Which eye?"
