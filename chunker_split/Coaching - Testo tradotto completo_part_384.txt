You might do no more than nurturing an inner desire to influence them, but the said lack of confidence in your ability will act as a barrier against the free action by your will, and you will largely end up accomplishing no result at all. That is so on account of the fact that, whenever will is not robust, suggestion cannot be carried out well, and your eyes will be denied the chance of taking on the intended expression. You should remember that the eyes are the windows onto one's mind or even onto his soul, and that a feeble will is going to confer on the eyes a radically different expression from the one which is gifted to them by a robustly vigorous will. Further remind yourselves of the fact that, if you want to be as far-reaching an achiever as you would like, you are enjoined to have an unlimited trust and an undiluted confidence in your own ability to ultimately achieve some special result indeed. This faith in yourselves, this certitude about your impending success, will empower you to avail yourselves of the full reservoir of power you happen to possess, in order for you to thereby accomplish the goal you have set out to actualize in your life.
