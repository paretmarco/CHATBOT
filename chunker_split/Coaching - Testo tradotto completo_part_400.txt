What essentially occurs with this method, therefore, is that you “will remember your own selves” in the course of the conversation. A very simple way of actualizing such approach is to lend attention to one specific part of your body, such as your hand. In that manner, you will create something like “psychological validation", and you will notice your interlocutor gradually moving to your side, with an increasingly favourable disposition to you. This method is very powerful. You will observe how your interlocutor will keep on talking non stop, as he will ultimately feel at ease. At the end, he will be the one eager to conclude the deal. In the course of the conversation generally: When we address a person by speech, we must constantly show ourselves to be duly attentive to the conversation, and we must never interrupt our interlocutor, however prolix he might happen to be. Our mode of listening must be a mode of active participation, one where the eye should play a role of essential importance.
