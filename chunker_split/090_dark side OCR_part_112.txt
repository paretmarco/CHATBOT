The child within, when involved with mechanics, plays the taped message. The child within experiences the "I don't under- stand" associated with machines, along with frustration as its outcome or the altered state it produces. Machines trigger the experience, and the child as an adult goes into the "I don't under- stand" trance. Principle I: An experience, once occurring following a pleasant outcome, will become part of the person's belief system exactly as it is. Inner Dialogue 4) 69 child struggles through it and succeeds, "See, if you work hard, you can do anything." The child has received his reward and approval and begins to "work hard" obsessively to do everything to get approval. Here, the hypnotic suggestion "work hard" can become frozen, an external trigger like money or approval, which then triggers "work hard and receive approval." This is placed on automatic. The resulting experience is one of feeling driven and yet experiencing it is never quite enough. Another style of self-talk which overlaps is "fusion" and will only be discussed in brief.
