Coaching and effective communication by using people’s role-related “trances” Whoever works on his fascination by following the path traced out in the present book will notice at once a growth of his influence over other people. Such a growth is due to the fact that most people are “asleep”, as they are in fact lost in a maze of conceptualizations and mental constructions which preclude them from being in the present, which is instead the sole thing in existence. If we are in the field of working with our fellow humans, then the scope which is sought to be accomplished by a refined form of coaching consists in understanding the aforesaid truth and in creating a communication geared towards bringing about a growth and development of people’s potentialities. This is a gradual process, and yet one which might prove to be highly productive for an organization, as it causes the members thereof to grow in a balanced fashion, which thing in turns ensures the organization’s own growth.
