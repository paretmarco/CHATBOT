This can be accomplished by having the client place an image of the idealized other next to the therapist and notice the similarities and differences.2 This leads to differentiating the past from the present. This is discussed in detail in Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology. 233 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness A major breakthrough in the Way of the Human is to realize that you, the therapist, and everyone else are human beings. This creates the experience of compassion and humanity. Without the dissolution of trance-Terence and narcissism, and the trance-ference processes of merger, twinship, mirroring, idealization and spiritualization, there can be no freedom or humanity which only comes through de-idealizing of the other (not as a put down) and the realization of our own humanness. How powerful is this experience of humanity? In the early 1980s, I realized that I was an incest survivor. At that time, there was only one Incest Survivors Anonymous group in New Mexico and sometimes I'd be the only one there. I can still recall the first time I went.
