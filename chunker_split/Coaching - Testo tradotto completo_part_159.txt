Some additional minor stratagems 1) A first tactic which helps control small emotional impulses, and which is the opposite of dispersing force, is to become conscious of this desire, extract from it the essence of its unrestricted physical force, and then slowly inhale air, during a time span of eight seconds approximately, with all the force which your lungs are able to muster. In the course of giving effect to this procedure, each one of you should mentally repeat the following formula to his self: “I consciously take into my possession the full and entire force of this desire”. You should then hold your breath for some eight seconds, as you reiterate the under-mentioned words in your mind: “I consciously absorb this force, which now belongs to me”. The last step is for you to exhale the air, again for a period eight seconds, in an unhurried and uniform manner, in so doing mentally repeating to yourselves this utterance: “I now possess a perfect measure and balance, by which I can make myself the master of the magnetic force I have accumulated”. Should one wish to do so, he might repeat the exercise several times in a row.
