Whether you disconnect into a pleasant or unpleasant situation, you can remove yourself just enough to shift the unpleasant expe- rience. It needs to be noted that an adult can choose in present time to disconnect or not. The inner child identity disconnects automati- cally, without choice, such as in the trance of sensory distortion, "I can't feel" (Chapter 13). The key word is choice. 4. Spreading sensations: In a headache the head is the localized area of attention and pain is not spread equally throughout the body. The approach for relief is to suggest that sensations can move. By suggesting that sensations can move (into the neck, toes, feet), provides an equal distribution of sensations. From a Buddhist point of view, much suffering is caused by the experience of being separate from another or separate from every- thing. Therefore, a reconnection to everything is a powerful experience of reunion.
