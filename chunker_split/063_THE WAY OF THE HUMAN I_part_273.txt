This inaccurate solution to this False Conclusion represents the newer brain's never-ending although unsuccessful attempt to handle the False Conclusion. Why is it unsuccessful? Because it is a solution to a False Conclusion, it does not address the problem. In other words, the conclusion or the basic premise is false, so the solution must be false too. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: A False Conclusion about what or why something is occurring can only yield a solution which cannot solve the problem because the solution is based on a false conclusion. The above is paramount to understanding the dilemma of the psychological and spiritual world. Both fields work with pain and both claim to know why people suffer. If, for example, the False Conclusion to why I am stuttering is, "My mother never loved me," this is the conclusion and if we somehow handle this, the pain will go away. In the spiritual world, False Conclusions can range from karma theory to lessons we need to learn. But these too are False Conclusions.
