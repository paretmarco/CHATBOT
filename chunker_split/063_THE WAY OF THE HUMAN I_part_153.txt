For example, I'm angry with you because you're too tall or you're too short or I need less affection or I need more affection. So if I'm in a relationship with you, and I identify with the thought called "I want you to be taller," you might say, "Okay I'll wear high heels and do my hair up in a bun!" When you buy into my thoughts of you, you may try to resist them as a way to a-void your False Core (Volume H). A basic teaching might therefore be stated as turning your attention to the changeless space that's always there.
