Study and understand the ancient books of hypnotism, and mostly the ancient books speaking of magnetism and mesmerism. You will therefore discover many phenomenologies as thought transmission, magnetic healing, hypnotism without words etc... which are no more practised now. Try to understand why the ancient were so at ease with the wording "animal magnetism". Try to understand also that many words used have changed their meaning through the centuries and try to get the original meaning. 2 - Practice to make your eyes stronger. Begin fixing a dot on a mirror and fixing it without blinking. At the beginning you will be able to fix it just for some seconds. At this point close them and repeat. After a due exercise (10 minutes each day for some weeks) your eyes will become stronger. On our site www.mesmerismus.info you can even find a free course for becoming more effective with your eyes. This is an asset in every social situation. 3 - Practice the same exercise as before without dot and fixing your image in the mirror at the third eye (the ajna chakra for the Indians). 4 - Practice "muscular tension". Tensing a muscle and after releasing it.
