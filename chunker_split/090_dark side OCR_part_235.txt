Gener- ally speaking parents give a reason for rewards or punishments. For example, a child who does what is suggested by Mom and Dad gets rewarded, now or in the future. Children who don't do what parents tell them are punished now or in the future. If our previous discussion is correct, and we make our parents into gods who are trying to teach us lessons, let us look at the possible outcomes. A child is rewarded for learning the lesson of cleaning his room. Another child is punished by parents for not learning the lesson. When the child is asked, "Why am I being punished?" parents say, because you need to learn lessons. Years later in school, a similar model of rewards and punish- ments is fused with the concept of lessons. For example if I learn my arithmetic lesson, I'm rewarded. If I don' t, I'm punished (have to do Spiritualizing â€¢ 145 extra homework). What impact could occur in the future. "If I am good, God gives me more things" (bliss, money, good relationship, etc.) because I learned my lesson.
