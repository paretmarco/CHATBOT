I am 12 Chapter 1 sure you will notice as you go through the material, that there are overlaps from previous work. Some of the material is similar, some dissimilar. Some of it is new, some are additions, clarifications, new translations or evolutions of other materials "I've" written about. The purpose of this is a completion for Quantum Psychology at the level of awareness so that ultimately "you" go beyond even awareness itself and beyond Quantum Psychology or Quantum Consciousness (see Volume III). By delineating all of these levels you can then consider the possibility of Going Beyond Awareness, Beyond ESSENCE, Beyond the I AM, into the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and into the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE and even BEYOND, which is beyond Quantum Psychology. To enquire in this way you'll face a lot of new challenges. There are many concepts we hold onto to explain the universe which act as sacred cows and prevent us frOm reaching the deeper levels of our own psyche and, consequently, of our humanity. I hope you have not found this opening too heavy-handed.
