However, the associational trance is a defense against experiencing what is. Your biology has the fight/flight scanning-searching and overgeneralizing mechanism. Unfortunately, these survival mecha- 101 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness nisms are not in present time. They are a collapsing of the levels so that the fight/flight scanning-searching-seeking and overgeneralizing mechanism at a biological level is fused with past events. You get a fusion of earlier similar events with your survival mechanism. All you need to do to dismantle it is to cut the associational network and then you can experience what's truly a threat and what's not a threat in the present time. Your survival mechanism goes through your entire associational network, i.e., your psychology. Your biology runs your psychology, not the other way around. Therefore, you should trace your False Core back through your fight/flight scanning and overgeneralizing survival mechanisms (see Volume II). THERAPY AND SPIRITUALITY COLLAPSE LEVELS MEET THE PROBLEM AT THE LEVEL OF THE PROBLEM You have to meet the problem at the level of the problem. If you have a psychological problem, then you had better meet it on the psychological level. You can get Feldenkrais sessions forever but they probably won't cure a financial problem.
