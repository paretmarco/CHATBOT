You can never go beyond the False Core Driver as long as there is an observer observing it because the observer is part of the system, it observes. Therefore the observer too must be dismantled (see Volume III). THE JUDGMENTAL OBSERVER People often think they are simply observing something, but there is judgment, evaluation or significance placed upon the experience that is being observed. Furthelinore, the observer is often either (1) in a state of dissociation caused by resisting an experience; or (2) in a state of fusion whereby the child fuses with Mom or Dad who is outside of them and observes and judges their behavior as either good or bad. In other words, children dissociate from their body-mind and see themselves through the eyes of a judgmental (this is good, this is bad) Morn or Dad, who later can be "Spiritualized" as gods.
