Therapeutic Note Once the verbal I AM-IS is gone beyond, the False Core-False Self and all "subjective" psychology too is gone beyond. Then only the NON-VERBAL 1AM might remain or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, THE ARCHETYPE REVIEW Archetypes can be viewed as a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS forming what "our" nervous system views as a pattern emerging from any possible number of combinations of the Physics Dimensions of energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces, etc. To review the process, let us begin with the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. The VOID is pure NOTHINGNESS, and to paraphrase again, noted physicist John Wheeler, "NOTHINGNESS is the building block of the universe." However, the NOTHINGNESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS has the quality of being "potentially" everything. It should be noted that unlike many current theories which believe that "you" (solidified VOID) can control, create, or co-create "your" universe, Quantum Psychology understands that the VOID condenses and creates what you call "you."
