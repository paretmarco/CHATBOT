Whenever he drank, he had to take out the picture, put it on the table and "toast" Dad saying, "Thank you, Dad, for teaching me how to handle stress." This exaggerated the inner child's fusion. A symptom can only be a problem if there is some kind of trance. When a person is "being here now," there is no trance. Actually, we can say no problem can exist without a trance.

This is the end of trance, hence, trance-ending. I know people that look directly at me but are not with me at all. There is a film over their eyes. Watch their eyes and notice if a film comes over them. Recognize this is a clue your partner is dis- connecting. This film over his eyes indicates he is watching an old film or movie and not being here now. In therapy, I might suggest something to intentionally create the trance you are having.
