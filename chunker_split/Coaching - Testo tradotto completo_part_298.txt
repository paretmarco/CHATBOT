Essentially speaking, the procedure of presentification consists in “living out and, if possible, representing to our own selves, the image of our future self as being something which is already in existence”, not just the way “it will turn out to be”. In other words, within ourselves we must visualize the matter as having materialized, already at this stage, just as much as the mental image of it that we are formulating exists at once now. This vivid ideational stirring into being must not be cold and forceless. Rather, we should add, to the original mental nucleus, some additional new particulars. We have to do that for the sake of forging a living image and subsequently projecting into it the strength of our desire. During the execution of this operation, our brain must behave like a magical lamp, which is always being faced by the image of the objects of our desire. The light cast by such a lamp shall have to be represented by our ardent desire. In order to enliven such desire as much as possible, it is necessary that the subject matter of our pre-ideation must be regarded by us as a mission for that specific day.
