Know how to set yourselves an objective You must set yourselves an objective, which has to be established by recourse to presentification and the demarcation of a specified time frame. It must consist in a direction you are setting out for, as opposed to a continuous tension of the soul. If you were to ask the majority of people investing in the financial markets to expound to you what their goal is, they will usually find it difficult to point it out to you in any exhaustive manner. In their attempt at supplying an explanation, they will trace their whole motivational urge to a simple issue of “earning money quickly and with little effort”. This phrase is born out of an emotion: The emotion of cupidity. Emotions are extremely dangerous to trading. They lead us to hurriedly slip into operations where the likelihood of success works against us and where we invariably take up excessively big risks compared to our true possibilities.
