They literally meant “to look with the intention of doing some good". [36] The eye can also perform healing deeds. 3. The various concentration levels The techniques of hypnotic healing which are presently in greatest use consist in concentration techniques. They channel attention into a specific direction which has a more positive impact on the patient. Besides them, there are also non-prescriptive techniques, such as the techniques developed by Milton H. Erickson, which endeavour to steer attention in such a manner as to lead the subject into a naturally therapeutic condition. ________________ 5. Concentration in India If we turn our look to the East, we will notice that in Yoga, too, one works on the aspect of concentration. There are three distinct levels of concentration. The first level is called dharana, and it consists in directing one’s concentration to an inflexible point. This initial phase is then succeeded by the one termed dhyana, being a phase in which concentration becomes a single continuum. Lastly, we have the so-called phase of samadhi, the one in which the object-subject relationship finally ceases to exist.
