Likewise, willing is the consequential confluence of two underlying elements: Possessing a valid ideal, and a sufficient reserve of mental energy. We truly want something when we have the ability to canalize our energy towards an ideal. But in which manner are we going to define an ideal? There are two minds operating within man. Some label them the conscious and the unconscious. We prefer to define them as follows: 1. A limited ego (the "I" that is replete with mental chattering), which is also a programmed ego – the automatic mental pilot –, i.e. the totality of habits, the ostensible logic which makes up our daily being and which engrosses most of our time; 2. A vaster mind, the essential inward being we get access to when we are being creative. We should use this larger mind as the departure point so as to define our ideals, our ultimate goals, in relation to the Universe.
