The method we are going to set out in this book, therefore, answers all these various questions: Is it possible to operate in the field of free activity, the field of individual action, in such a way as to carry out a more effective undertaking within the same time of span (say, for instance, one day), and thus secure for ourselves “more time”, so to speak? Is it possible, amid the tumult of everyday life, to find a simple method that enables us not to lose sight of our own selves? Is it possible to daily reduce the role which is played in our existence by the type of chance we fear, and simultaneously increase the percentage of likelihood and materialization of the chance we hope for? Is it possible to reduce the effort that is needed to carry out a particular deed or series of deeds, which we now come to view as “tiresome”? Is it even possible to reach the stage of turning the context into a “pleasant” one?
