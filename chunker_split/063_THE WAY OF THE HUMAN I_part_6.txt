All "I" could imagine was that at some level, Nisargadatta Maharaj had planted seeds and that Quantum Psychology was the fruit of those seeds. I recall that when "I" was writing Trances People Live in 1985, "I" thought I had come up with this incredibly brilliant idea called associational networks. I thought, "What an incredible discovery," that inside the mind there are associational networks. Even the term made sense to me. I remembered Freud having written that the mind organizes itself in chains of earlier similar events, but "my" idea of associational networks seemed even clearer. I picked up one of Milton Erickson's books shortly thereafter which I think was called, Experiencing Hypnosis. And right there, was exactly the same phrase, Associational Networks. What exactly does this mean? Did I come up with it? Did Erickson come up with it? Had I read it? Had I not read it? I don't know. When I completed the original book, The Way of the Human, I realized that parts of it (dimensions) were somewhat similar to G. I. Gurdjieff's Fourth Way idea of the different centers.
