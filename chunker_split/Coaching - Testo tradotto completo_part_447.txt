This book plays the role of an aid enabling you to become aware of those tools, and to learn how to practically turn hypnosis to your advantage rather than allowing the opposite to take place. The Trader The figure of the trader has developed owing to the emergence of Internet and online trading platforms. The ease with which, nowadays, one can access markets and invest his own money at once in whatever he might desire has caused and is still causing many rich people to hope to earn large sums quickly, while remaining comfortably seated in front of their personal computers. This is no doubt possible, and yet the keys to be able to remain operative in the markets are located first and foremost inside our own selves: In the control over oneâ€™s mind, in self-discipline, and in the percipient understanding of a series of elements produced by the sum-total of psychological attitudes from millions of people. The markets, in fact, are not fully rational, given that their behaviour is conditioned on the interlaced effect of so many individual psychologies. Therefore, a person who decides to invest money in trading without having a profound working knowledge of the laws governing the markets will have extremely thin chances of succeeding.
