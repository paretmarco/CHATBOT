Learning FASCINATION means learning the hidden keys of the GAZE. Technically we define “fascination” as a particular mental state, similar to what occurs when we are involved from a movie or something that attracts our attention. The analysis of the phenomena of fascination involves the use of multiple brain areas: • The part of the brain that interprets what he sees, that connects the cerebral cortex • The part of the brain that lives emotions that connects to the limbic system • And the deepest part of ourselves, our reptilian brain, which provides the basis of the process of fascination, blocking our attention The process is triadic: recognition and observation of an item => emotional charge => fascination and capture attention. The STATE OF FASCINATION is different from the classic trance.
