Wolinsky:How have you tried to deceive the container?Wolinsky:Regarding this container is there a gravitational collapse around this central core? Wolinsky:Why would you want to deceive the container? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter III Wolinsky:Tell me an emotion that emerges from that col- lapsing around the central core. Alice:Safetydiscomfort, and alone. Therapeutic Note Here Alice has moved beyond the False Core-False Self of I am Alone. I hope to effortlessly connect her to her Essential Core with no judgement, evaluation or significance about it. Wolinsky: So the alone identity is part of the collapse. Is the "I am alone" Identity part of the collapse, or part of you? They are the same. Are you it? No. What's happening now? Spacious. Therapeutic Note Once the container and the False Core are gone beyond, there is just the Essential quality of spaciousness. Is the alone the by-product of the collapse? Yes, no collapse, no alone. I am really blown away by this.
