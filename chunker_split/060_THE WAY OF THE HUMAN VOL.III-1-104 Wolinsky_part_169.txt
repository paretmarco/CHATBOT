You'll be surprised how much attachment you have, how many good or bad feelings (energy) attached to it. Now, go back into the EMPTINESS from which the symbol arose, to the space prior to the symbol, and focus on that VOID. Practice Now, I'd like you to let an image come to you, of a spiritual or religious symbol. Notice what your positive or negative feelings are about it. Then find the VOID prior to the emergence of that symbol. Now, let another religious symbol come up into your awareness, notice the image, good or bad, and find the VOID from which that symbol came. Now, let another religious symbol come up into your awareness, notice the energy, and find the VOID from which that symbol came. Allow another spiritual symbol to come into your awareness, and again, locate the VOID that symbol came from. And finally, one more religious symbol, notice the energy attached to it, and find the VOID and stay in the space where all religious symbols come from; in fact, stay in the VOID where all symbols come from. Go deeply into that VOID.
