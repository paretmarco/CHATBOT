The purpose of these maps is not to lose sight of your ultimate goal, but rather to use them so you can identify where your own attention and awareness might be stuck or fixated, thus inhibiting "your" awareness of the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness. Awareness, once it has been freed from habitual fixation, leads to the liberation of awareness. In short, this first Volume in the trilogy is about multi-dimensional awareness and functional awareness. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the functional awareness, the greater the "subjective" experience of freedom. The exclusion of any part of your human nature does not reflect worship of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE—but shows denial and hatred (misunderstanding) of its manifestation. In this way, to be fully human is to have your consciousness and awareness free and liberated. This could be the answer to the question of where the human potential movement and Eastern traditions of self-realization meet—the liberation of your awareness at all dimensions of manifestation. This current Volume assumes previous understanding. With this in mind, the earlier two Volumes, Quantum Consciousness Volume I and the Tao of Chaos: Quantum Consciousness Volume II should be used as references.
