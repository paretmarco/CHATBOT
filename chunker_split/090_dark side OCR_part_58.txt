Recently, I was working with a client who complained how much she hated herself, and how she heard a voice inside her head saying, "You're bad," "You deserve to be punished," and "I hate you." We discovered that as a child she was physically abused by her stepfather who would say precisely these things to her. What Age Regression + 33 occurred was that the observer took a picture of the beaten child and the stepfather. Both lived inside of her, and she would hear the voices inside of her saying, "You're bad," "You deserve to be punished," and "I hate you." This part of the inner child had fused and become the perpetrator. So the perpetrator's voice (hypnotic suggestion) had become part of the inner child' s dark side. These voices and the ensuing poor self-esteem was a past- time trance, which came from the perpetrator. Once the inner child fuses with the voice, even years later, the perpetrator lives within the adult as an inner child identity, giving the adult outrageous suggestions. This will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7, "Inner Dia- logue".
