These dimensions need to BE without interference in order to liberate awareness which might help in the discovery of who you are.4 Stated another way, since Quantum Psychology defines spirituality as the realization that there is only ONE SUBSTANCE, then true spirituality must include everything from emotions to thoughts and from fantasies to the physical bodyâ€”since there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Actually, as will be discussed later, what we are ultimately looking at is a biological spirituality whereby biology and psychology are included within spirituality, and the underlying unity of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. WHY MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS? In the early 1990s, Quantum Psychology continued to grow and expand through books such as Quantum Consciousness, Volume I, The Tao of Chaos: Quantum Consciousness, Volume II. The question that continued to emerge from workshop participants as "I" traveled throughout the United States and Europe was no longer, "Who Am I?" but rather, "How do we as human beings live our lives and still maintain the awareness of the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness?"
