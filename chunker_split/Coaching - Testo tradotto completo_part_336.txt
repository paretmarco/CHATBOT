A building presupposes the prior drafting of plans on the part of an architect who has pondered at length its size, its degree of importance, and the purposes which the building to be erected will have to serve. In spite of that fact, the actual construction of this building is going to materialize but by bit without the architect needing to direct his attention to the whole, inasmuch as it is enough for him to focus on the immediately next phase of the work at any given time. In that manner, we do not have to live under a perpetual spiritual tension about the building having to necessarily resemble a fixed idea. It would suffice us if we were to generally target the purpose behind our activity. This is indeed what we have done so far, and what we are now going to do through the means of self- fascination and self-magnetism, which are forms that might be likened to hypnosis in one sense, and yet are additionally accompanied by a thought shot through with energy. In the course of the preceding chapter, we have spoken about presentification. Visualization might avail us in this context. Constructing images is the key to the meeting between will and imagination.
