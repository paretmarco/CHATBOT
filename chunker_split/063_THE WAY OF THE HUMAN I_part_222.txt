It is experiencing, at a biological level, everyone's ESSENCE and your ESSENCE as the same. In short, it is an effortless process whereby you are being held up by gravity. However, like a fish who does not notice the water, gravity (once aligned) goes unnoticed and is effortless. I met with Jack Donnelly, a Rolfer of some 29 years, and asked him what Rolf meant when she talked about the BIOLOGICAL CORE. According to Jack, You are dealing with gravity. When you are dealing with gravity, you are dealing with what Ida called, the primal core, which goes from the pelvic floor up to about the solar plexus, and the high core which goes from the cranium down to about the solar plexus. That is where they meet. . . . Rolf felt, according to Donnelly, "that psychology was formed by a breakage in the core." She said that the primal core and gravity are related to the earth, and that the high core is related to the gravitational pull of the sun, and that line between the sun and earth on a gravitational level is the Rolf line.
