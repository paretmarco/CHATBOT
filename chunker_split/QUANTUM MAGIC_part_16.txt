o After reaching out with one's mind and connecting its resonance pattern intimately with the non-local web of wave patterns connecting everything, invoke deities whose natural function is related to the purpose of your ritual. If successful, this connects your mind to a powerful, established, non-localized, intelligent resonance matrix that (hopefully) joins in the magic. o Focus on the target of the work, connecting with the target. o While connected with the target, visualize the end result desired, thus creating a resonant template for the phenomenon one wants to achieve. o Energize the resonance through dance, drumming, chants, pure channeling of will power, or other means. o Release the energy into the target while strongly visualizing the target achieved (energizing the resonance in the target). o Ground, removing ones mind from the direct, resonant link with the target, so that the patterns you have set in motion in the target can continue with minimum interference (to throw a ball, one has to let go). o Thank and say goodbye to the intelligences one works with, thus disconnecting ones mind further from other resonance matrices.
