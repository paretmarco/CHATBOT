Why is the False Self unable to heal ________________ Chapter II or overcome the False Core and the Realization of Separation? Because they are one unit like inhaling and exhaling, that co-exist, you can't have one without the other. That's why I prefer the descriptions of each False Core-False Self to focus on the False Core driver rather than on the compensators. Somehow it feels more direct and honest. It should be noted that some psycho-spiritual schools believe that the False Self Compensator is healthier than the False Core. Quantum Psychology feels the opposite is true, that the compensation "looks" more healthy and socially acceptable. However, it is an integrated age-regression and is insidious using tricks by the False Self, as defense against the False Core and the Realization of Separation. For Quantum Psychology, the "decompensation" is more direct, honest, and certainly more uncomfortable. However, until the failure of the False Self is seen through along with its illusions, and the discomfort felt, it is impossible to go beyond the False Core-False Self and stabilize awareness. in ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc.
