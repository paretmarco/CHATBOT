The NOT-I-I is beyond the, observer-observed dyad; it is Pure Awareness which a yogi would call WITNESSING (the observer-observed dyad). (See Volume III.) The observer is the ego observing itself. The observer is actually a part of the structure it is observing and it too has to be gone beyond. Some systems, like Vipassana (insight), Buddhist meditation, or Gurdjieff work as it is presently being taught, think there is one observer which observes and exists "before" the observed. They don't get that the observer is part of the observed and that there are an infinite number of observers along with an infinite number of experiences.' In this way if "I'm" sitting here in self-observation, it often appears as though a thought comes up like "I love myself' or "I hate myself." But actually what happens—and this is the major difference in the Quantum work—is that both an observer and an observed (thought) simultaneously arise and subside together as one unit. And then a new observer or thought or experience arises and subsides together as one unit.
