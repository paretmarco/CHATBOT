Donato has them all in his power, he attracts them in threes, in sixes, ten at a time, simply by rapidly staring into their eyes, even against their firm will and their obstinate efforts to resist his suggestion. [. . .] Donato, in the process, never speaks: he thinks, he wants and points.

He suggested to one that he was Garibaldi at Aspromonte; to another that he was the commanding general of the school, etc. They assumed the gait, the carriage, the gestures and the voices, and played perfectly the parts of the personages, whom they represented, and with whom of course they were acquainted; for fascination no more than hypnotism can give to anyone knowledge of the unknown. These, as well as young healthy people that turn stiff despite their efforts to do otherwiseâ€”such were the events to be seen on the stage of the Teatro Scribe in Turin in 1886.
