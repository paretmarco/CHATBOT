If, at this later stage, we have become divested of control over such trances and unable to prevent their occurrence, we can safely affirm that they are now unfolding themselves automatically. 12. The effectiveness of the look-based therapy The therapy which is founded on the look accordingly represents a tool to cause the subject to retrace his steps from an intrapersonal trance to an interpersonal one, i.e. one which is piloted by the operator. We put this therapy into practice by observing the patient as he clues us with his personal situations, while we simultaneously encourage him to gaze at us. By letting our patients describe their symptoms while they keep on «breathing and looking at the operator», we succeed in interrupting their internal trance, and we convoy them to an interpersonal trance. This development brings about a change in the context of the problem, and adds to the picture the operator (= we ourselves as we are busy talking to him) in his capacity as a resource. If we want to express it basically, we would say that we “enter” the mental scene of our patients.
