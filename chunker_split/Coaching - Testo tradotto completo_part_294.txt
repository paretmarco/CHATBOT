Taste corresponds to the activity of the deepest mind We deliberately use the word “taste”, because, from a neurological point of view, the activity we are trying to describe here is linked to the primary activity of the cerebellum, which represents the most primitive part of the mind. It consists in nothing other than the externalization at a higher level of a primal motion. You can understand the extent of the veracity of what we have just stated even by observing non-verbal communication. When something truly involves our persons, one can notice an increase in salivation or in any event an increment in some activity which takes place at the level of the mouth. If you are a mentor, pay heed to such phenomenon in your apprentice. You can alternatively observe it in your own selves! If, while you are busy imagining something, you notice an olfactory signal (which symbolizes interest) or a gustatory one, you can rest assured that you have delved into the deepest areas of the mind.
