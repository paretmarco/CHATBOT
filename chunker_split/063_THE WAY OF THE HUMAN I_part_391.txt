The Way of the Human, therefore, is to realize and be aware of our humanness, ordinariness, vulnerability, and underlying connection to humanity, all simultaneously. THE TRANSITION PHASE In the transition phase of development, the child is separate from Mom. However, to make this transition, the child might have a teddy bear, pillow, or a blanket. The child makes the inanimate object animate, and thus still feels connected, having not quite completely left the merger with Mom. If a person does not complete this phase, then they are susceptible to a trance-itional spiritual object. For example, a mantra, prayer beads, a rabbit's foot, or a picture hung around the neck, all are re-enactments of the unfinished transition phase. When separation from Morn is complete, the trance-itional objects can be given up. It must be understood that the child's/ disciple's desire for God could be a desire for their merging with mother, and that spiritual paraphernalia are a spiritualized re-enactment of teddy bears and blankets. Although they make the person feel more comfortable, when they can be seen for what they are, they can be given up.
