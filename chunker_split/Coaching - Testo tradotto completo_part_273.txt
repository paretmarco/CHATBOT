The critical analysis of the day is as indispensable a tool as the balance sheet, and in any event — for purposes of the method — neither of them has any meaning without the other, so long as, at least, one wants the past to act as teacher of the present. At the initial stage of applying the method, the critical examination must be extremely thorough. It must come out as if it were a true confession, guided by a spirit of rectification rather than one of mere ascertainment of facts. The form assumed by this exam will thus be interrogative in nature. A few schematic annotations will fix the results of such analysis in a stable, standard form. We will lastly move onto the examination of the frames of the self. What we have put up in these frames consists in the schematic portrayal of what might happen to be the object of our activity, both from the physical and from the intellectual, economic, sentimental, family-related and social domains, as well as that activity of ours which is devoted to the fulfilment of pleasures.
