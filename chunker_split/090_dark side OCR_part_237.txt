Schools of thought, philosophies, which give ways to alleviate suffering, are deeply rooted in the inner child. What is the central issue? Organiz- ing chaos. For some reason, possibly due to the cause-effect and linear nature of thoughts, we resist chaos. Noted Feldenkrais trainer Dr. Carl Ginsburg related a story to me about the founder of Feldenkrais (a form of body-mind awareness), Moshe Feldenkrais. Feldenkrais was leading a training and asked the group of about 60 trainees, "What is the purpose of the nervous system?" Students came up with all sorts of answers which Feldenkrais dismissed. His answer? "The purpose of the nervous system is to organize chaos." In the same way, the inner child organizes chaos by transferring the system she created to handle Mom and Dad onto the rest of the 146 . The Dark Side of the Inner Child world. The child inside the adult can roll along on automatic pilot, treating the past as the present, creating the future from the memory of the past, in an attempt to fit the present-time world into a system that appears to make sense.
