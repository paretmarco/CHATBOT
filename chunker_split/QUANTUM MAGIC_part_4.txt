These quantum mechanically defined states define the probabilities of various results from quantum mechanically defined interactions [2]. In one orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics, a system exists simultaneously in all quantum mechanically possible states until an observer (or apparatus outside the system) interacts to "collapse" the state vector" and obtain an observation. Quantum mechanical systems can go from one configuration to another instantly, without passing through any states in between. Quantum mechanical movement is discontinuous, with all actions occurring in discrete amounts (quanta). Schrodinger himself discovered one of quantum mechanics' more distinctive features: whenever two systems interact, the mathematical waves that represent the two systems do not separate but remain linked. The link does not drop off with distance and the link acts instantaneously at both locations, but the specificity of the link can be diluted through interactions with other objects [7]. WHAT UNDERLIES QUANTUM MECHANICS? There are lots of hypotheses on the nature of the underlying reality described statistically by quantum mechanics.
