Working, acting, producing, this is what is needed by both the poet and the devotee of sensual pleasures, by the philosopher as much as by the winemaker, both for his own sake and for the sake of the world. We must learn the art of dreaming— that is indeed true —, but we must also master the art of exploiting our dreams productively. There is, then, yet another art we will need to grasp, namely, the art of delegating to those who are intellectually inferior to us the fulfilment of those exigencies which are merely a means and not a goal of our activity. We are called upon, in other words, to learn how to always judge whether we are not actually able to do something better, something more useful, of a higher level than what we are engrossed with, by simply entrusting to our subordinates the preoccupation of physically bringing us the bricks with which to construct the building. Whoever dies without having expended everything he could have given has lived in vain. In order, however, to live fully, we ought to probe our own selves and organize our activity.
