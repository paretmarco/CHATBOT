(Mis)labeled ESSENCE is then perceived as being a problem. It should be noted that the (mis)labeled spaciousness of ESSENCE becomes empty (as in a lack), and can mis- 2 Chapter 1 takenly be seen as the reason for what has been termed "existential pain."' Existential pain (often described as emptiness within the physical body) is labeled as the "meaninglessness," or "aloneness" etc., of life.

It can also be said that labels placed on ESSENCE subsequently become the alleged Archetype known as the shadow (see Chapter 3, "The Collective Unconsciousness"). For now, it can be said that all the things you do not want to know because they are associated with the shock of the Realization of Separation are blamed on the (mis)labeled (mis)perceived BIG EMPTINESS which is now emptiness (as in a lack) (which is not ESSENCE).
