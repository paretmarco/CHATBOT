The use of hypnosis in medical procedures has been reported, with some dentists even using hypnosis techniques during their procedures. To understand and utilize the different levels of trance to achieve the desired outcome in hypnotic and medical settings, it is important to delve into the three states of consciousness.

The first state is the waking state, where the conscious mind is alert and aware of its surroundings. The second state is the trance state, where the conscious mind is relaxed, and the subconscious mind is more receptive to suggestions and ideas. The third state is the deep trance state, where the conscious mind is completely shut off, and the subconscious mind is in complete control.

The Hellman method is a popular technique used to induce a state of trance. During the induction process, it is important for the operator to speak only during the person's inhalation as they become more profound in their trance during the exhalation. It is also crucial to bring the person deep enough into trance to prevent their breathing from disturbing the state of trance.

Once the state of trance is achieved, different techniques such as the use of silence or specific suggestions can be utilized for deeper trance states. The suggestion related to exhalation is the most effective as the deeper the person's breath, the more profound they become in the trance state.

In medical procedures, the use of trance can be beneficial in reducing the patient's anxiety, pain, and stress levels. However, it is essential to utilize different levels of trance to achieve the desired outcome effectively.

In the past, women were only taken to the hospital for delivery when they were already in the advanced stage of labor. There was no anesthesia, and the pain was often intense. However, over the years, techniques have been refined to achieve a state of tranquility and spiritual involvement during childbirth. Today, many women prefer to use ultrasound to establish a mental state devoid of physical pain but with intense spiritual involvement.

The technique of visualization is crucial in hypnosis, but it is important to remember that not everyone can visualize as only 20% of people have a visual mind. Hallucinations are a bit like creating images with the mind, but it is important to use the word "imagine" instead of "look." Even those who cannot visualize can benefit from hypnosis effectively.

The use of magnetic steps in hypnosis can lead to strong reactions. The process begins with a body scan and continues with the imposition of hands very close to the person without touching them. During this technique, the aim is to relax the muscles and perceive the warmth of the hypnotist's hands.

The importance of deepening is an element of hypnosis that can lead to a stronger response from the subject. Magnetic steps or other techniques can be used to deepen the suggestion. It is important for the hypnotist to have feedback from the person to understand if the deepening has worked.

The initial phase of hypnosis is crucial to explain what to expect from the session and eliminate myths about hypnosis. It is also essential to conduct tests to understand the type of suggestion that works best for the person. Additionally, a warm-up can help the person feel more comfortable during the session.

Many people fear hypnosis, but it is essential to explain to them that there is nothing to fear. It is important to dispel myths about hypnosis and explain how the mind works. Additionally, a good pre-talk can help the person feel more comfortable and relaxed during the session.
