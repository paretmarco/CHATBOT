Title: The Importance of Emotional Intelligence in Business and Life

Victor Hugo once said, "When we speak, we are afraid our words will not be heard or welcomed. But when we are silent, we are still afraid. So, it is better to speak." This quote perfectly encapsulates the importance of emotional intelligence in both business and personal life. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to understand, manage, and express emotions effectively. It involves using emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, as well as to recognize and respond appropriately to others' emotions.

In business, emotional intelligence is crucial for success. It allows individuals to navigate complex situations and build strong relationships with clients and colleagues. For example, when dealing with a difficult client who wants to sell a house for an unrealistic price, staying present and observing emotions can be useful. By acknowledging their emotions and playing with them, you can create a bond that enables you to better understand their needs and desires.

However, emotional intelligence is not just important in business; it is also essential in personal life. By listening attentively to others and showing empathy with their feelings, you can connect with them emotionally and create a stronger bond. It is also important to be aware of your own emotions and not let them guide you, but instead, use them to guide your behavior and actions.

Title: Developing Presence through Energy Exercises

Maintaining presence is crucial when working with clients. It requires staying grounded in your body and being aware of your surroundings without worrying too much about them. This is achieved through certain exercises that help you connect with your body and improve your presence.

One such exercise involves feeling the different parts of your body, such as your hands and feet, to improve awareness and presence. However, it is important to avoid using habits or movements that you already do, as the exercise is meant to bring attention to parts of your body that are less present. Another technique involves regression, where the focus is on the hands or foot, which are usually less touched by the environment, allowing for greater attention and focus.

Additionally, an aromatic agency exercise can be used to develop the right and left branches of your body and improve energy flow. This involves standing in front of a mirror and observing yourself without blinking, slowly moving backward and forward until your hands feel light and go up. By regularly practicing these exercises, you can improve your presence, energy flow, and overall well-being.

Title: Mirror Exercise for Self-Awareness

The mirror exercise for self-awareness is a powerful tool for developing a peaceful sensation in the solar plexus and activating different energies in the left and right eye. It helps in developing self-awareness and may lead to a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye.

To perform this exercise, begin by looking at yourself in the mirror while starting with your hands up and then letting them fall down. Next, focus on the solar plexus and allow a peaceful sensation to develop. Then, focus on the right eye, inhale, and clench the fist, and then exhale. This should be repeated for the left eye while clenching the face. You may experience a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye.

When looking beyond oneself in the mirror, you may see an aura or a silver color around yourself. When shifting back to the left eye, the color may change to a golden yellow. This indicates the activation of different energies in the left and right eye, which may vary depending on whether you are left-handed or right-handed.

In conclusion, the mirror exercise for self-awareness is a simple and effective way to develop presence, energy flow, and self-awareness. It is a powerful tool for increasing emotional intelligence and improving relationships in both business and personal life.
