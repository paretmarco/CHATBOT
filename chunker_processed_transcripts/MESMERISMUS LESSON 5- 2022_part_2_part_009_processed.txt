Connecting and correcting the transcribed text:
The transcribed text contains some errors and repetitions. The correct version of the exercise involves looking at oneself in the mirror, starting with the hands up and then letting them fall down, followed by focusing on the solar plexus and allowing a peaceful sensation to develop. Next, one should look at oneself in the mirror and focus on the right eye, inhaling and clenching the fist, and then exhaling. This should be repeated for the left eye while clenching the face. One may experience a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye.

Looking beyond oneself:
When looking beyond oneself in the mirror, one may see an aura or a silver color around oneself. When shifting back to the left eye, the color may change to a golden yellow. This indicates the activation of different energies in the left and right eye, which may vary depending on whether one is left-handed or right-handed.

Conclusion:
The mirror exercise for self-awareness is a powerful tool for developing a peaceful sensation in the solar plexus and activating different energies in the left and right eye. It helps in developing self-awareness and may lead to a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye. One can use a non-reversing mirror or a reflecting surface to perform this exercise.
