In this text, the speaker discusses the benefits of a mirror exercise as a form of self-hypnosis. By activating the two snakes (symbolized by the two eyes), the central energy is activated, leading to increased energy and presence. The exercise involves focusing on the right eye, followed by the left eye, and then returning to the right eye with a decision to be present. This exercise can be used to enter a super state of presence and increase charisma and directness.

The Warm Water and Cold Water Exercise

The speaker also describes an exercise involving warm and cold water that had previously been unsuccessful until performed after the mirror exercise. By putting oneself in a state of presence, one can change neurological connections and experience sensations without needing external conditions, similar to being in a flow state.

The Flow State

The concept of the flow state, coined by a writer named Csikszentmihalyi, is discussed as a state of being in the moment and performing at one's best. However, this state is typically only achieved under certain conditions. The present state achieved through the mirror exercise is described as a super flow state, allowing for increased openness and presence without needing external conditions.
