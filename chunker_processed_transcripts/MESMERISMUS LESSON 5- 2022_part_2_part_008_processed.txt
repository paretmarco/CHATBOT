Title: Developing Presence through Energy Exercises

Maintaining presence is crucial when working with clients. It requires staying grounded in your body and being aware of your surroundings without worrying too much about them. This is achieved through certain exercises that help you connect with your body and improve your presence.

One such exercise involves feeling the different parts of your body, such as your hands and feet, to improve awareness and presence. However, it is important to avoid using habits or movements that you already do, as the exercise is meant to bring attention to parts of your body that are less present.

Another technique involves regression, where the focus is on the hands or foot, which are usually less touched by the environment, allowing for greater attention and focus.

Additionally, an aromatic agency exercise can be used to develop the right and left branches of your body and improve energy flow. This involves standing in front of a mirror and observing yourself without blinking, slowly moving backward and forward until your hands feel light and go up.

By regularly practicing these exercises, you can improve your presence, energy flow, and overall well-being.
