A flow state is a super state of mind that some artists and actors achieve when they are fully present on the scene. However, it can be easily disrupted by negative feedback or emotions. To achieve a flow state, one must disconnect from their thoughts and worries and focus solely on the present moment. This is the best way to be fully present and use our full potential.

Presence is a flow state without conditions. It means being fully aware of the present moment without any distractions or worries. This can be achieved by practicing mindfulness techniques and letting go of negative thoughts.

To help clients achieve this state, techniques such as the Oklahoma blockage and hand locking exercises can be used. These exercises are not only helpful for insomnia but also for relaxation and stress relief.

However, it is important to note that hypnosis and other techniques will only work if the person is willing to let go and relax. It is important to create a safe and comfortable environment for clients to achieve this state.

In conclusion, achieving a flow state of mind requires disconnecting from our thoughts and worries and focusing solely on the present moment. Mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises can be helpful in achieving this state.
