Title: Aura Exercise - Connecting the Right and Left Energies in the Brain

In this text, the concept of an exercise related to the aura and how it connects the right and left energies in the brain is discussed. The exercise involves connecting the right and left eyes to create new neurological connections. The speaker mentions that left-handed people may have an advantage in changing directions during the exercise, but this is not the main focus of the exercise. 

Before doing the exercise, it is said that seeing the aura can increase its effectiveness. However, the main objective of the exercise is not to see the aura. The exercise is described as a variation of an answer region exercise. By connecting the right and left eyes, new neurological connections are created in the brain. 

The frequency and lighting of the exercise are also discussed. The speaker mentions that the exercise can be done with any type of light and position, and the focus should be on the exercise itself. It is important to note that the exercise should be done several times to achieve the desired results.

During the exercise, a phenomenon known as the "big face" phenomenon may occur. This is a sign of self-hypnosis, and the mind is more open during this state. It is important to note that this is a natural occurrence and not something to be afraid of.

Title: Mirror Exercise - Self-Hypnosis and Increased Presence

The speaker in this text discusses the benefits of a mirror exercise as a form of self-hypnosis. By activating the two snakes (symbolized by the two eyes), the central energy is activated, leading to increased energy and presence. 

The exercise involves focusing on the right eye, followed by the left eye, and then returning to the right eye with a decision to be present. This exercise can be used to enter a super state of presence and increase charisma and directness. 

The warm water and cold water exercise are also discussed, which had previously been unsuccessful until performed after the mirror exercise. By putting oneself in a state of presence, one can change neurological connections and experience sensations without needing external conditions, similar to being in a flow state.

Title: Achieving a Flow State - Mindfulness Techniques and Relaxation Exercises

The concept of a flow state is discussed as a super state of mind that some artists and actors achieve when they are fully present on the scene. However, it can be easily disrupted by negative feedback or emotions. To achieve a flow state, one must disconnect from their thoughts and worries and focus solely on the present moment. 

Presence is a flow state without conditions. It means being fully aware of the present moment without any distractions or worries. This can be achieved by practicing mindfulness techniques and letting go of negative thoughts. 

Techniques such as the Oklahoma blockage and hand locking exercises can be used to help clients achieve this state. These exercises are not only helpful for insomnia but also for relaxation and stress relief. However, it is important to note that hypnosis and other techniques will only work if the person is willing to let go and relax. 

It is crucial to create a safe and comfortable environment for clients to achieve this state. In conclusion, achieving a flow state of mind requires disconnecting from our thoughts and worries and focusing solely on the present moment. Mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises can be helpful in achieving this state.

Title: Techniques for Sleeping and Trauma Healing

Sleeping is essential for our physical and mental health. However, many people struggle to fall asleep due to various reasons, including trauma. In this text, we will explore techniques for helping people sleep better and heal from trauma.

Passes are a technique used to help individuals relax and fall asleep. When performing passes, it is essential to say something to the individual, as this can help them let go and relax. Additionally, passes can activate the parasympathetic response, which is crucial for promoting relaxation and sleep.

Trauma is a common cause of sleep disturbances. Therefore, when using techniques to promote sleep, it is essential to address any underlying trauma first. Otherwise, the results may not be effective. Working on automatism and the person's trauma can help individuals sleep better.

The Stop technique is a powerful tool for promoting relaxation and mindfulness. It involves stopping whatever one is doing and paying attention to their senses, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. By focusing on the present moment, individuals can relax and let go of any negative thoughts or worries.

In conclusion, techniques such as passes, working on trauma, and the Stop technique can be helpful in promoting relaxation and sleep. It is crucial to address any underlying trauma before using relaxation techniques.
