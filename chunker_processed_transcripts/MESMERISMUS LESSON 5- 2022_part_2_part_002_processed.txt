In this text, we explore the concept of personal magnetism and how it can be developed through presence and awareness of the body. We begin by discussing the Lucy exercise, which involves rocking on catalepsi local blockage and working on strengthening and speeding up the eyes. We also emphasize the importance of presence in increasing magnetism and developing personal magnetism.

To illustrate the concept of presence, we conduct an exercise with the participants where they speak and focus on their body and surroundings. We observe how their voices change as they become more present and aware of their body. We also discuss the importance of being present when speaking with clients and how it can affect their perception of us.

Finally, we provide two techniques to maintain presence and awareness of the body, which can be useful in developing personal magnetism. These techniques can help individuals stay grounded and centered even in high-pressure situations.

Overall, this text emphasizes the importance of presence and awareness of the body in developing personal magnetism and effectively communicating with others. It provides practical exercises and techniques to help individuals cultivate these qualities and develop a magnetic presence that can help them succeed in various aspects of life.
