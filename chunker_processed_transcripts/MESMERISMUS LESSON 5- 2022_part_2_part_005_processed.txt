Sometimes, thinking too much can lead to overthinking, just as eating too much can become unnatural. Aristoba explains that people who struggle with presence often lack a solid basis and may have difficulty maintaining it for an extended period of time. Although you can construct presence with attention, it is not the same as natural verticality, which should be effortless, like a small child's posture.

When it comes to individuals with personality disorders like sociopaths and narcissists, their natural charisma may seem like a survival mechanism. However, this presence is often possessive and not a true representation of natural presence. True presence is more human and does not cut off emotions. It is about being the master of your emotions and not the slave to them.

To differentiate between natural and unnatural presence, observe body language. A person with natural presence is more human and does not cut off emotions. They master their emotions and are not slave to them. An example of natural presence is a person waiting for someone with sunflowers. If the person does not show up, they are not overly upset and can move on.

In conclusion, natural presence is about creating energy in a natural way. It is effortless and not possessive. By mastering your emotions, you can achieve true presence.
