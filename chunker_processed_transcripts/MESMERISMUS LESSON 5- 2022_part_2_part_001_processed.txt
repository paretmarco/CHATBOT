Using, Connecting, and Correcting Automatically Transcribed Text: Lesson on Presence and Hypnosis

Greetings everyone! It's great to see you all here. I am Leah David, and joining me today are Catherine Amaso, Andrew McDonald, and Fabian. I believe some others will be joining us soon as well. I noticed that the automatic transcription has translated parts of our conversation into French and Spanish, but let's stick to English for this lesson.

Before we begin, I want to remind you that if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me or anyone else here. Just click the button and speak up. Marco, you had a question about working with a client who struggles with alcohol addiction. While the Campanelli method can be helpful, I have a few additional tips that might be effective. For instance, you can work with the sensation of wine by suggesting that it tastes like vinegar. Another technique is to suggest sleep to the person, as drinking is often a way to escape reality. We will discuss this topic more in the advanced lessons. 

Fabian, you asked about the effectiveness of using a ball of light to help your client with alcohol addiction. While a ball of light can be helpful for neuromuscular attention and activating parasympathetic states, it's not specific to alcohol addiction. Instead, try using a real light source. 

Now, let's move on to today's lesson, which is all about presence. We will be doing the "Lucy exercise," which involves catalepsy, local blockage, and other techniques to help you become more present. Additionally, there will be exercises to strengthen your eyes and work on your personal relationships. 

Remember, if you have no clients at the moment, work on yourself. Practicing the techniques I give you will make you more charismatic and reliable, which will benefit you in all aspects of life. And don't forget to ask questions! The more you ask, the more you'll learn. 

Thank you all for being here today, and let's get started with the fifth week of our program.
