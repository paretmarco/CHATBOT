Using, Connecting, and Correcting Automatically Transcribed Text: Lesson on Presence and Hypnosis

Greetings everyone! It's great to see you all here. I am Leah David, and joining me today are Catherine Amaso, Andrew McDonald, and Fabian. I believe some others will be joining us soon as well. I noticed that the automatic transcription has translated parts of our conversation into French and Spanish, but let's stick to English for this lesson.

Before we begin, I want to remind you that if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me or anyone else here. Just click the button and speak up. Marco, you had a question about working with a client who struggles with alcohol addiction. While the Campanelli method can be helpful, I have a few additional tips that might be effective. For instance, you can work with the sensation of wine by suggesting that it tastes like vinegar. Another technique is to suggest sleep to the person, as drinking is often a way to escape reality. We will discuss this topic more in the advanced lessons. 

Fabian, you asked about the effectiveness of using a ball of light to help your client with alcohol addiction. While a ball of light can be helpful for neuromuscular attention and activating parasympathetic states, it's not specific to alcohol addiction. Instead, try using a real light source. 

Now, let's move on to today's lesson, which is all about presence. We will be doing the "Lucy exercise," which involves catalepsy, local blockage, and other techniques to help you become more present. Additionally, there will be exercises to strengthen your eyes and work on your personal relationships. 

Remember, if you have no clients at the moment, work on yourself. Practicing the techniques I give you will make you more charismatic and reliable, which will benefit you in all aspects of life. And don't forget to ask questions! The more you ask, the more you'll learn. 

Thank you all for being here today, and let's get started with the fifth week of our program.
In this text, we explore the concept of personal magnetism and how it can be developed through presence and awareness of the body. We begin by discussing the Lucy exercise, which involves rocking on catalepsi local blockage and working on strengthening and speeding up the eyes. We also emphasize the importance of presence in increasing magnetism and developing personal magnetism.

To illustrate the concept of presence, we conduct an exercise with the participants where they speak and focus on their body and surroundings. We observe how their voices change as they become more present and aware of their body. We also discuss the importance of being present when speaking with clients and how it can affect their perception of us.

Finally, we provide two techniques to maintain presence and awareness of the body, which can be useful in developing personal magnetism. These techniques can help individuals stay grounded and centered even in high-pressure situations.

Overall, this text emphasizes the importance of presence and awareness of the body in developing personal magnetism and effectively communicating with others. It provides practical exercises and techniques to help individuals cultivate these qualities and develop a magnetic presence that can help them succeed in various aspects of life.
Title: Techniques for Building Presence

Building presence is essential to living a conscious and focused life. However, it can be challenging to maintain a high level of presence amidst the constant barrage of distractions in modern life. In this text, we will discuss some techniques for building and maintaining a state of presence.

Keeping Attention on One Hand or Foot

One simple technique for building presence is keeping attention on one hand or foot. By simply being aware of the sensation in one part of the body, we can increase our physical awareness and prevent our mind from getting clogged by distractions. This technique is particularly useful for those moments when we find ourselves lost in thought, as it allows us to bring our attention back to the present moment.

Gradual Extension of Presence

Through consistent practice of this technique, our presence will gradually extend throughout the body. This can be achieved through progressive relaxation, where we focus on each body part and release any tension. By doing so, we can become more aware of our physical sensations and increase our overall level of presence.

The Importance of Remembering to Be Present

While this technique is simple, it can be easy to forget to implement it in our daily lives. However, the most important thing is to remember to be present, even if we lose focus momentarily. It's like losing a sword in a battle - we just need to pick it up again and continue fighting. By consistently bringing our attention back to the present moment, we can create an ingrained habit of presence.

Presence and Charisma

Presence is the foundation for developing charisma. When we have a high level of presence, we become more focused and engaging, which can have a positive impact on those around us. In this way, presence is not only beneficial for our personal well-being, but also for our social interactions.

The Basis of Yoga

While many people practice yoga for physical fitness, at its core, it is a practice of presence. Without presence, we cannot fully experience the benefits of yoga. Therefore, it is important to remember that the position is secondary to the awareness we bring to the practice.

Title: The Physical Effects of Presence

The physical effects of presence are noticeable both internally and externally. When we are present, we can feel a tingling sensation, which is a result of increased vascularization and activation of the parasympathetic system. Additionally, when we are present, we tend to move less, which can be observed by others. This can lead to a greater sense of confidence and charisma in social situations.

Title: Cultivating Presence in Everyday Life

Presence is not something that only exists in certain situations - it is a state of being that can be cultivated in everyday life. By consistently practicing techniques such as keeping attention on one hand or foot, we can gradually increase our level of presence. This can have a profound impact on our overall well-being and social interactions. So, let's make presence a daily habit and see the positive changes it brings.
The Hermetic Caduceus: A Symbol of Energy and Correspondence

In this online course, we will be discussing the Hermetic Caduceus, a symbol that has been used by doctors and physicians for centuries. It is also a symbol of energy and correspondence within the yoga tradition.

Tingling Sensations and Vascularization

When you experience a tingling sensation, it is likely due to changes in your vascularization. This can activate the parasympathetic system and cause you to feel certain impressions.

The Two Branches of the Hermetic Caduceus

The Hermetic Caduceus has two branches and resembles the Ida and Pingala in Indian tradition. The two snakes on the Caduceus connect at points that correspond to the solar flexors and other plexuses within the body.

The Correspondence Between the Right and Left Sides

The right and left sides of the Hermetic Caduceus correspond to the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the nervous system. When both sides are activated, it can produce a central energy that can flow throughout the body.

Developing Charisma and Energy

Through the exercises and techniques discussed in this course, we can develop a natural charisma and energy. This can lead to a more present and confident presence, similar to those seen in the past during uncertain times.

The Importance of Being Present

Being present is crucial to our well-being and can lead to a healthier mind and body. While some individuals may naturally possess a certain charisma, it is possible for anyone to learn and improve upon it through practice and dedication.

In conclusion, the Hermetic Caduceus is a symbol of energy and correspondence that can help us better understand our bodies and minds. Through developing our natural charisma and energy, we can become more present and confident in our daily lives.

Sometimes, thinking too much can lead to overthinking, just as eating too much can become unnatural. Aristoba explains that people who struggle with presence often lack a solid basis and may have difficulty maintaining it for an extended period of time. Although you can construct presence with attention, it is not the same as natural verticality, which should be effortless, like a small child's posture.

When it comes to individuals with personality disorders like sociopaths and narcissists, their natural charisma may seem like a survival mechanism. However, this presence is often possessive and not a true representation of natural presence. True presence is more human and does not cut off emotions. It is about being the master of your emotions and not the slave to them.

To differentiate between natural and unnatural presence, observe body language. A person with natural presence is more human and does not cut off emotions. They master their emotions and are not slave to them. An example of natural presence is a person waiting for someone with sunflowers. If the person does not show up, they are not overly upset and can move on.

In conclusion, natural presence is about creating energy in a natural way. It is effortless and not possessive. By mastering your emotions, you can achieve true presence.
Presence and Sensations
--------------------------------------------
The speaker describes a sensation they experience when practicing presence. They feel a buzzing, electric sensation on the right side of their body, which spreads to their brain. This sensation lasts for 20 seconds and makes everything around them seem brighter. The speaker advises not to try and enhance this sensation, but to simply observe it.

Mastering Emotions
-------------------------------------------
The speaker discusses their tendency to remain calm and collected in emotionally charged situations. They do not react when clients or others say something mean or offensive, but rather focus on finding a solution to the problem. The speaker wonders if this is similar to what the lesson on mastering emotions is referring to.

Business and Emotions
--------------------------------------------
The speaker draws a parallel between their ability to navigate complex business matters and their tendency to remain calm in emotional situations. They use the example of dealing with a difficult client who wants to sell a house for an unrealistic price. The speaker suggests that staying present and observing emotions can be useful in business as well as personal life.
How to Connect with Clients Emotionally and Maintain Control

When working with clients, it is essential to connect with them emotionally. By doing so, you can create a bond that enables you to better understand their needs and desires. One way to do this is by acknowledging their emotions and playing with them.

Understanding Your Client's Emotions

To connect with your client emotionally, you need to listen to them attentively. Let them express themselves and show empathy with their feelings. However, you should also be aware of your own emotions and not let them guide you.

Manipulating Emotions in Therapy

In therapy, clients often behave like little children. When they insult you, it is essential to be aware that this is only a reflection of their emotions. You should not let these comments affect you emotionally, but maintain your presence and continue to love the client.

The Importance of Being Present

Being present is critical when working with clients. By doing magnetic passes, you can connect with your client on a more profound level. By being present, you can better understand their needs and desires, and create a stronger bond.

Practicing Presence in Therapy

To practice being present in therapy, you need to do magnetic passes and put your maximum presence. This will help you connect emotionally with your client and maintain control of the session.

Conclusion

Connecting emotionally with your clients is essential to creating a healthy bond that can lead to better results. By understanding and acknowledging their emotions, you can better understand their needs and desires. By being present, you can maintain control of the session while creating a stronger bond.
Title: Developing Presence through Energy Exercises

Maintaining presence is crucial when working with clients. It requires staying grounded in your body and being aware of your surroundings without worrying too much about them. This is achieved through certain exercises that help you connect with your body and improve your presence.

One such exercise involves feeling the different parts of your body, such as your hands and feet, to improve awareness and presence. However, it is important to avoid using habits or movements that you already do, as the exercise is meant to bring attention to parts of your body that are less present.

Another technique involves regression, where the focus is on the hands or foot, which are usually less touched by the environment, allowing for greater attention and focus.

Additionally, an aromatic agency exercise can be used to develop the right and left branches of your body and improve energy flow. This involves standing in front of a mirror and observing yourself without blinking, slowly moving backward and forward until your hands feel light and go up.

By regularly practicing these exercises, you can improve your presence, energy flow, and overall well-being.
Title: Mirror exercise for self-awareness

Introduction:
This exercise involves looking at oneself in the mirror and activating different energies in the left and right eye. It helps in self-awareness and developing a peaceful sensation in the solar plexus.

Connecting and correcting the transcribed text:
The transcribed text contains some errors and repetitions. The correct version of the exercise involves looking at oneself in the mirror, starting with the hands up and then letting them fall down, followed by focusing on the solar plexus and allowing a peaceful sensation to develop. Next, one should look at oneself in the mirror and focus on the right eye, inhaling and clenching the fist, and then exhaling. This should be repeated for the left eye while clenching the face. One may experience a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye.

Looking beyond oneself:
When looking beyond oneself in the mirror, one may see an aura or a silver color around oneself. When shifting back to the left eye, the color may change to a golden yellow. This indicates the activation of different energies in the left and right eye, which may vary depending on whether one is left-handed or right-handed.

Conclusion:
The mirror exercise for self-awareness is a powerful tool for developing a peaceful sensation in the solar plexus and activating different energies in the left and right eye. It helps in developing self-awareness and may lead to a tingling sensation and a change in the size of the left eye. One can use a non-reversing mirror or a reflecting surface to perform this exercise.
Title: Understanding the Aura Exercise

The following text has been automatically transcribed and may require some corrections. It talks about an exercise related to the aura and how it connects the right and left energies in the brain.

Left-Handed Advantage?

The text starts by discussing left-handed people who may have an advantage in changing directions during the exercise. The speaker mentions that such people are rare and that the exercise is not about handedness. 

Seeing the Aura

The next section of the text talks about seeing the aura before doing the exercise. It is said that this can increase the effectiveness of the exercise. However, the speaker clarifies that seeing the aura is not the main objective of the exercise.

Variation of an Answer Region Exercise 

The exercise is then described as a variation of an answer region exercise. By connecting the right and left eyes, new neurological connections are created in the brain.

Frequency and Lighting 

The text then discusses how many times the exercise should be done and the type of lighting that is best suited for it. The speaker mentions that the exercise can be done with any type of light and position and that the focus should be on the exercise itself.

Big Face Phenomenon 

The text concludes by discussing the "big face" phenomenon that occurs during the exercise. It is explained that this is a sign of self-hypnosis and that the mind is more open during this state.

In conclusion, the text provides insight into an exercise related to the aura and how it connects the right and left energies in the brain. It also discusses the importance of frequency and lighting and the "big face" phenomenon that occurs during the exercise.

In this text, the speaker discusses the benefits of a mirror exercise as a form of self-hypnosis. By activating the two snakes (symbolized by the two eyes), the central energy is activated, leading to increased energy and presence. The exercise involves focusing on the right eye, followed by the left eye, and then returning to the right eye with a decision to be present. This exercise can be used to enter a super state of presence and increase charisma and directness.

The Warm Water and Cold Water Exercise

The speaker also describes an exercise involving warm and cold water that had previously been unsuccessful until performed after the mirror exercise. By putting oneself in a state of presence, one can change neurological connections and experience sensations without needing external conditions, similar to being in a flow state.

The Flow State

The concept of the flow state, coined by a writer named Csikszentmihalyi, is discussed as a state of being in the moment and performing at one's best. However, this state is typically only achieved under certain conditions. The present state achieved through the mirror exercise is described as a super flow state, allowing for increased openness and presence without needing external conditions.

A flow state is a super state of mind that some artists and actors achieve when they are fully present on the scene. However, it can be easily disrupted by negative feedback or emotions. To achieve a flow state, one must disconnect from their thoughts and worries and focus solely on the present moment. This is the best way to be fully present and use our full potential.

Presence is a flow state without conditions. It means being fully aware of the present moment without any distractions or worries. This can be achieved by practicing mindfulness techniques and letting go of negative thoughts.

To help clients achieve this state, techniques such as the Oklahoma blockage and hand locking exercises can be used. These exercises are not only helpful for insomnia but also for relaxation and stress relief.

However, it is important to note that hypnosis and other techniques will only work if the person is willing to let go and relax. It is important to create a safe and comfortable environment for clients to achieve this state.

In conclusion, achieving a flow state of mind requires disconnecting from our thoughts and worries and focusing solely on the present moment. Mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises can be helpful in achieving this state.
Title: Techniques for Sleeping and Trauma Healing

Sleeping is essential for our physical and mental health. However, many people struggle to fall asleep due to various reasons, including trauma. In this text, we will explore techniques for helping people sleep better and heal from trauma.

Passes and Parasympathetic Response

Passes are a technique used to help individuals relax and fall asleep. When performing passes, it is essential to say something to the individual, as this can help them let go and relax. Additionally, passes can activate the parasympathetic response, which is crucial for promoting relaxation and sleep.

Trauma and Automatism

Trauma is a common cause of sleep disturbances. Therefore, when using techniques to promote sleep, it is essential to address any underlying trauma first. Otherwise, the results may not be effective. Working on automatism and the person's trauma can help individuals sleep better.

The Stop Technique

The Stop technique is a powerful tool for promoting relaxation and mindfulness. It involves stopping whatever one is doing and paying attention to their senses, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. By doing this, individuals can become more aware of their bodies and thoughts, promoting relaxation and better sleep.

Balancing Senses for Harmony

Balancing one's senses is essential for promoting harmony and overall well-being. This involves addressing any fears or traumas that may be causing an imbalance in one's senses. By balancing one's senses, individuals can perceive the world more fully and be more in touch with their bodies.

Child Development and Perception

Children's development and perception play a crucial role in their sleep patterns. Children are naturally kinesthetic and need to touch and feel things to understand them fully. Therefore, limiting their exposure to electronics and encouraging physical contact can help promote healthy sleep patterns.

Title: Next Steps and Surprise Therapy

After learning these techniques for promoting better sleep and healing from trauma, the next step is to work on personal management and surprise therapy. These techniques can help individuals take control of their lives and overcome unexpected challenges.

In conclusion, sleep is essential for our well-being, and trauma can significantly impact our ability to fall asleep. However, by using techniques such as passes, the Stop technique, and balancing our senses, we can promote better sleep and overall well-being. It is essential to address any underlying trauma before using these techniques, and children's development and perception play a crucial role in promoting healthy sleep patterns.
If you end after, you must see it, and you see that the child normally does it: they do around, they touch everything, they try to get in contact, they feel. And so when you are grown, you say you have the feeling of everything that is around you. So instead, when you say something is real with you, you don't have to touch it; you see and you know, even already the sensation. So in reality, the sensation is the starting point, and even in the philogenesis, which means in the history of the senses, the first sense was the sensation. In the sense that we know for the hearing data, there's some movement inside the ear, and we even observe that the sense of sight comes from an unsigned moment when we use it. So we didn't divide too much today. The classroom that I would do now is just to answer questions with Kathy, and with the English and Spanish, there are just two people. So we will divide now. It's good to divide the classroom. Maybe we do some exercise just for French, English, and we will do about 15 minutes in the classroom. I will now divide the career Allah session one. I will do Alexander, Andrew, Andrea, Anthony, Azina, Christopher, and see Christopher. I will do a session for Christopher Elite, and okay because they speak Spanish, and we will do David. David doesn't speak that good Spanish. He speaks better English. Okay, at this point, I will put English, and I would do English David. I will put French. This is the best one. Differential in the group. This is the best, and I will just go to the French outside. They will stay with you, and I will speak with the theory I know from here. This session, I will close. These people can stay in the main room. Alexander, Andrew, okay, I will do just a session for the French now, so the French people are asking to go in the room that I will open. If I forgot some French, you will tell me, and I will put, okay? And you are with Kathy, okay? Somebody asked some questions regarding how we can effectively work with personality disorders as is usually multi-multi. This is very good. Uh, fires, yes, yes. This is uh, oh, there is a very good technique to work with personality disorders. There are two ways to work with these multiple personality disorders. One is crisis, and the second one is like working with the path center in the paths of the body. There is something that we can do in the advanced mountain here, and you enter into there. You could ask here the crisis, could the crisis also good to work with the past because it can let because when a person is blocked, this can also be expressed as parts. A person feels blocked, and so when we block in this way, it is good even mass metal detail wellness. May wrote a book, and he told somebody uses spirit day most gods, but it's very simple, it's energy. And so, in some way, he wanted to say that this concept of energy applies also to paths, law to pass. So there are two ways, one way is in this way, and the actor is practically with a series of regression where we enter into this sample personalities, and after we release, we can even mix for the even if we will see the complete system in advance. You can do a regression entering as a personality, work with this personality as a person, even if it is a past life, and do a crisis, and you will release, you will free it. This is the simplest way they use it in any culture. I should say that is why the crisis and the crisis and in another personality. And after any crisis is a technique that is practicing practically in every culture. The other application that somebody of you can have otherwise, I will do something with Andrea Heine. What would you say is the best method for self-crisis? Next election, we do serve guys, but they can anticipate to you. And next lesson, if you feel sometime some emotion yourself or something like this that tends to increase the distention, permit yourself to increase distention because the standard is to the upper parts, as we did the oculomotor blockage, as we do in the upper moctaw blockage, and permits to your body to move normally.

In this conversation, the speaker discusses techniques for moving and influencing the body. They begin by discussing how to alleviate distention in the upper parts of the body using oculomotor blockage. The speaker notes that by allowing the body to move normally, one can increase movement in a gradual and automatic way. They also suggest using the eyes to initiate movement and avoid relying on the body's stuck parts.

The conversation then shifts to the topic of influencing others. The speaker advises against trying to influence people in "big stuff" and instead suggests starting with smaller movements or actions. This can create a better connection with others and lead to a more positive relationship. The speaker also notes that it is important to stay present and aware of oneself to avoid being influenced in a negative way.

The discussion concludes with practical advice for non-verbal commands. The speaker suggests using intention and visualization to communicate with the body and influence breathing patterns. They also recommend using mirrors and eye contact for younger individuals to facilitate positive suggestion and change.

Body language can be a powerful tool in communication, especially when working with young people. By looking someone in the eyes and giving suggestions, one can easily connect with them and receive a positive reaction. The technique of using a mirror can also be effective in self-reflection and self-improvement.

Title: Working on Body Movement

In order to improve body language and communication, practicing movements and gestures can be helpful. By following instructions and imagining oneself as another person, one can become more aware of their own body and movements. Practicing with a friend can also be a fun and effective way to improve.

Title: Staying Present and Connected

Maintaining a sense of presence and connection with others is essential in effective communication.

It is important to remember to disconnect after practicing, in order to return to one's own body.

Title: Looking Ahead

Continuing to practice body language and communication techniques can lead to improved relationships and better communication skills. By introducing self-rises and crisis techniques, individuals can become more confident in their ability to communicate effectively in any situation.
