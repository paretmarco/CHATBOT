Design and implementation of a natural language processing (NLP) module for user queries

Integration of LlamaIndex for retrieving relevant information based on user queries

Construction of GPT prompts using retrieved information for generating book content

A. Variables:

user_query: string variable representing the user's question or query
relevant_info: list of documents or information relevant to the user's query
book_content: string variable representing the content of the book generated from the relevant information


I give you info again on llamaindex:

The workflow is straightforward and takes only a few steps:
Build an index of your document data with LlamaIndex
Query the index with natural language
LlamaIndex will retrieve the relevant parts and pass them to the GPT prompt
Ask GPT with the relevant context and construct a response
What LlamaIndex does is convert your original document data into a vectorized index, which is very efficient to query. It will use this index to find the most relevant parts based on the similarity of the query and the data. Then, it will plug in what’s retrieved into the prompt it will send to GPT so that GPT has the context for answering your question.

Setting Up

We’ll need to install the libraries first. Simply run the following command in your terminal or on Google Colab notebook. These commands will install both LlamaIndex and OpenAI.

!pip install llama-index
!pip install openai
Next, we'll import the libraries in python and set up your OpenAI API key in a new .py file.

# Import necessary packages
from llama_index import GPTSimpleVectorIndex, Document, SimpleDirectoryReader
import os

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-YOUR-API-KEY'
Constructing the index and saving it

After we installed the required libraries and import them, we will need to construct an index of your document.

To load your document, you can use the SimpleDirectoryReader method provided by LllamaIndex or you can load it from strings.

# Loading from a directory
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('your_directory').load_data()

# Loading from strings, assuming you saved your data to strings text1, text2, ...
text_list = [text1, text2, ...]
documents = [Document(t) for t in text_list]
LlamaIndex also provides a variety of data connectors, including Notion, Asana, Google Drive, Obsidian, etc. You can find the available data connectors at https://llamahub.ai/.

After loading the documents, we can then construct the index simply with

# Construct a simple vector index
index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex(documents)
If you want to save the index and load it for future use, you can use the following methods

# Save your index to a index.json file
index.save_to_disk('index.json')
# Load the index from your saved index.json file
index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex.load_from_disk('index.json')
Querying the index and getting a response

Querying the index is simple

# Querying the index
response = index.query("What features do users want to see in the app?")
print(response)

An example response.
And voilà! You will get your answer printed. Under the hood, LlamaIndex will take your prompt, search for relevant chunks in the index, and pass your prompt and the relevant chunks to GPT.

Some notes for advanced usage

The steps above show only a very simple starter usage for question answering with LlamaIndex and GPT. But you can do much more than that. In fact, you can configure LlamaIndex to use a different large language model (LLM), use a different type of index for different tasks, update existing indices with a new index, etc. If you’re interested, you can read their doc at https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
PROMPT use 
I give you also the following article
As per the llama_index doc: https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/prompts.html#gpt_index.prompts.prompts.RefinePrompt

You can ask follow up question by:

from llama_index.prompts.default_prompts import DEFAULT_REFINE_PROMPT

follow_up_query = “<your_follow_up_question>”

response = index.query(

follow_up_query,

refine_template=DEFAULT_REFINE_PROMPT,

similarity_top_k=5

)

Or you can write a wrapper yourself to concatenate your previous queries and the responses to make it the context of the new query.
