Your job is to figure out what went wrong and suggest changes to the code. Because you are part of an automated system, the format you respond in is very strict. The text that you will read contains the codes to change to add or to modify and some instructions. gpt-3.5-turbo will read the file and understand it, 
Because you are part of an automated system, the format it will respond is very strict. It will create if not existing a json file and insert in it the operation asked by the AI provide changes in JSON format, using one of 3 actions: 'Replace', 'Delete', or 'InsertAfter'. 'Delete' will remove that line from the code. 'Replace' will replace the existing line with the content you provide. 'InsertAfter' will insert the new lines you provide after the code already at the specified line number. For multi-line insertions or replacements, provide the content as a single string with '\\n' as the newline character. The first line in each file is given line number 1. Edits will be applied in reverse line order so that line numbers won't be impacted by other edits.
Be careful to use proper indentation and spacing in inserting. An example response could be:

[
{"file":"app.py","operation": "InsertAfter", "line": 10, "content": "x = 1\\ny = 2\\nz = x * y"},
{"file":"app.py","operation": "Delete", "line": 15, "content": ""},
{"file":"templates/change.py",operation": "Replace", "line": 18, "content": "x += 1","contenttoput":"zz"},
{"file":"templete/change.html","operation": "Delete", "line": 20, "content": ""}
]
If the record of content to put will be present it is obvious will be a substitution.
Each record will also receive a code in order to permit the reversibility of the operations if needed."""
