Meditation nr. 5 - ETHER  
What is your real I? Many times we feel that is another I in ourselves. An I that knows better than our actual I I who we are.


The initiate chevalier, after having worked on himself, liberates the divine seed in his heart. 
This dimension is called "the double"
We get in contact with an higher dimension of ourself
The quality to develop here is SENSITIVITY. Try to be sensitive to your inner being and also to the other ones around you.
Ether - Quintessence: Meeting our double
Practising presence is like a travel
The goal is getting back in connection with ourselves.
This other ourself comes out in dreams, in intuitions.


Why the double image of the knight?
We are double.
There is an elevated part of us.
And at the same time another part of us in the matter.
To connect them we must come back to the present.


How can we practice?
As we walk. Try to stay very aware of yourself.
Try to feel your body
You will notice a sensation behind you
This sensation will be of something strong that you always have behind you
Your gaze must be completely open
Two half moons your eyes
Progressively you will understand the meaning of the ancient templar seal with a knight sitting behind another knight




  





Chivalry of the Graal
After having gone through the first level of the initiation a higher power was born.
Meeting the double
  

After having won the giant Perceval has a new power.
After having exited from the Castle of the air, Perceval sees a man flying from a snake. This man tells him the road.
The snake that has been woken up is ENERGY. And a serpent is Cernunnos, the celtic God of the Vital force
A serpent also we have in the caduceus, symbol of energy
  

After the initiation, a new energy has been woken in us!


________________


The White Knight  
Very important is that an initiated knight doesn't let himself be absorbed by appearances. His double is not outside, but inside. In the Perceval the white knight is the symbol of it. He let himself get absorbed in thinking he was in love.
Perceval meets the White Knight. He beats him. The white knight from several years ago is there and the name of the place is Ford Amoureux. He asks Perceval if he wants to stay there but Perceval says not. 
Questions and Answers
Who will see you?
A white knight
What is he doing?
He watches a river, symbol of the movement of love
From how long is there?
From 7 years. He thought he could become the most magnificent knight. But he is still there 
Do you want to stay there?
No, because I understand that water moves, emotions go away. I don't want to direct my energy there. I want to go to a higher level. I will proceed further.


________________




Perceval continues and meets a beautiful woman. But a knight arrives. He says he is the Beautiful unknown and he becomes friend with Perceval
It is a curious name “the beautiful unknown”


This beautiful unknown is another level of yourself
Only after having had gone through the first initiation you can really meet our real double,our other self, and meeting him be can begin to develop our energy


Both arrive now to a beautiful house where there is a lake with fishes
This lake is a symbol of energy.
From now on you will be a chevalier of energy
Exercise
Go in front of a mirror.
Again look at you. Always without blinking
Who is in front of you?
Who is the beautiful unknown?


Obviously, after the previous meditations, the experience will be different than at the second stage




In the next lesson we will delve into five experiences. 
You can access them because you are now connected to the second level of initiation.
You have been admitted to it.

The Hero's Journey
We have only to follow the thread of the hero path. And where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a God. And where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves. And where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence. And where we had thought to be alone, we shall be with all the world."


~ Joseph Campbell






Next lessons we will go to the Temple of Solomon and after to the Graal!
