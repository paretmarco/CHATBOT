How to heal Magnetically

Magnetical healing is very simple. It is a passage of information. Practically as you are near your client, you entangle with him. At this point if you can solve the problem in yourself, you can solve the problem in your client. Normally therefore a person that has overcome an illness can become a "natural healer".
Working on presence is fundamental in order to learn by yourself to solve the problems and also to overcome the three dimensional differenvce in space between you and the other. Probably we are already all very entangled at a deep level, and quantum physics doesn't deny it, but we are not aware of it. To heal we must in some way go to this deeper level. If we do healing will naturally happen. What people call "energy" in reality is not energy in the habitual sense of the word. It is knowledge and perception of a deeper level where entanglement begins. Therefore some people says that energy seem to pass from a person to another. In reality both are feeling the same. The concept of energy is strictly bound with awareness. The more we enhance awareness the more we have energy. In some way this energy is also a vital force.
