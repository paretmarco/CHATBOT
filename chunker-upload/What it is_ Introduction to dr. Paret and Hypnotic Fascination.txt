Fascination, also known as hypnotic fascination, is a powerful tool that has been used for thousands of years to control the mind, manipulate human behavior or healing through deconstructing false concepts or releasing traumas. It is rooted in the ancient tradition of animal magnetism and has been a closely guarded secret of certain secret societies for centuries. The power of fascination lies in its ability to tap into the deepest parts of the human mind, allowing individuals to access their full potential and achieve greater success and personal power.
In the past, techniques based on words were not as commonly used as they are today. Ancient hypnotists were able to hypnotize individuals quickly and without the use of words. Furthermore, if you read ancient texts, you will find that some ancient hypnotists were much more skilled than modern practitioners. Techniques such as mental suggestion, telepathy, and many other phenomena were well-documented in ancient texts. There is a secret behind these techniques that modern hypnosis lacks. Modern hypnosis techniques rely heavily on the use of words, but the results achieved by ancient practitioners were obtained without words. It is impossible to fully describe a nonverbal system with words.
Dr. Marco Paret is the main world authority in the field of fascination. He has dedicated his career to uncovering and understanding the true nature of this powerful tool to which he was initiated by powerful masters. Through years of research and study, Dr. Paret has uncovered the secrets of hypnotic fascination and has developed new techniques to make it more accessible and easy to use for individuals of all backgrounds.
Dr. Paret's work on fascination is particularly important in today's world, as the knowledge and practice of true magnetic tradition is increasingly rare. The power of hypnotic fascination is rooted in the ability to control the gaze and use it to create a connection between individuals. This connection can increase bonding and improve relationships, activate the ventral vagus nerve, and create a sense of imitation. The use of gaze in hypnotic fascination can also lead to faster hypnosis, catalepsy, and even the freeze response seen in animal hypnosis.
Dr. Paret has also delved into the connection between fascination and the ancient practice of kundalini, the serpentine power within the human body. He shows how the power of gaze can develop concentration, dharana, dhyana, samadhi and even kundalini, leading to greater personal power and release from traumas of life.
Through his published books and international coaching, Dr. Paret offers powerful techniques never been revealed before, based on the latest research on human potential. These techniques are designed to connect ancient and modern knowledge, allowing individuals to hypnotize without words and to access the paranormal. For those interested in business, Dr. Paret's techniques can also be used to develop the power of charisma and personal magnetism. Overall, Dr. Paret's work on fascination is a valuable resource for anyone looking to unlock their full potential and achieve greater success and personal power.
