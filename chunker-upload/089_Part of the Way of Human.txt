The Way of the Human ■ Developing Multi-Dimensional
Awareness Dr. Carl Ginsberg says it this way:
For potent, erect action, the extensor system must bring the skeletal structures to a center core around which action can he organized. I am convinced that the sensing of this skeletal security equates with the ability to he present in the moment, and to act without self interference or overt over-conscious control. A very young child can hold the head in near perfect balance with clear support from the central structural core of spine and pelvis.
Fear, however, produces the flexor responses which
contract the system away from this core of support, and require that muscular action be produced to counteract this contraction in order for the person to continue to be able to act in gravity. ln the ideal state all action is produced with an even distribution of tonus throughout the musculature. In the more typical situation this clarity of organization is lost through the overlay of responses including emotions, feelings and thoughts impressed by parents and social conditioning. The person, sensing the inner collapse, produces a masked state of the musculature to control the appearance to the outside world, and to provide some sense of control and security given the loss of the inner core. Thus a False Self is created.
In my practice of the Feldenkrais work [ often find that the central issue behind a person's complaints is the lack of awareness of their BIOLOGICAL CORE in the sense in which I have described it above. My clients, however, do not usually come to find a new center. They complain of holding tension in their shoulders and neck, or between the shoulder blades, or in the lower back. What l observe is that the tension in question is the consequence of necessity. With-
