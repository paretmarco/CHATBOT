PROGRAM AND SYNTHESIS OF THE ADVANCED COURSE DONE IN RUSSIA

Goal of the course:
Learning what ecstasy is and how can be of benefit in therapy
Deepen the techniques of the first level and in specific learn different methods of inducing crisis
Learning a specific framework called non verbal hypnotism using also the power of sound to induce a state
With non verbal hypnotism and ecstasy combined create deep trances
Learning the basis of a non verbal therapy where we do regressions in an "evocative" way using just non verbal communication
Magnetism techniques for well being
Some Quantum and Hermetic Paradigms
Many exercises of self hypnosis (with the mirror, with water with movement)

1st day
=========================================NOT DONE IN ROME
(general demo Taurus - Movement - Ecstasy
What is TAURUS?
Taurus is the name of a very powerful technique that can induce deep hypnosis fast in everyone 
BENEFITS: it can induce deep trances and somnambulism fast, it can be done with groups, it introduces the client to open up 
METHOD: It is based on a specific breathingand instructions
For explanation of Taurus see the slide
LEVEL 1)
LEVEL 2 In the advanced course we do these elemnts more than what on the slide: 
we add LIGHT
we add PASSES
and we work with a regression.
Doing a regression after having done a Taurus inductio is very easy
It is also possible to use TAURUS to induce ECSTASY 
============================================
BEGIN OF THE FIRST DAY
============================================
As Taurus in Rome was already done
BEGIN THE COURSE
Explanation of Ecstasis as the fifth state
We put ourself in circle
Breathing as for Taurus (without hand up)
Stop breathing to much
Pi quan
Putting away from the head positive and negative thoughts
Small touch

Some people will fall
Finishing Pi Quan
Finishing with IAO

This is for everybody in order to experiment
We take the individual experiences
Concept of Solve and Coagula
Now we show individually
=================================================
MAGNETIC CIRCLE
Why we did a circle?
Objective: introduce people to non verbal hypnosis / show different reactions / showing the power of a group 
Hermetic interpretation: we create an egregore
Sociological interpretation: we create another space outside the normal reality

Magnetic circle - note: magnetic circle will contain: sounds (that you demonstated some moments before) - magnetism - ecstasy and the persons will fall down at a certain point because they will no more be able to manage the intense energy we develop

===============================================


MAGNETIC ECSTASY
Magnetic ecstasy is a technique that will create a PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE
History: Ecstasy has a long history, even ancient people worked on ecstasy 
Use in therapy: at the end of a therapy. It will help the client to have even a deeper transformation
There are different level of ecstasy. The more a person will have worked before the higher he will go 
Physiological interpretation: strong activation of an answer of the dorsal parasympathetic system
Hermetic interpretation: developing the "quintessence" for going in a verticality / energy goes up / white phase in alchemy

Principal points to work on to create Ecstasy
1 - Bring before the person into the somnambulism using some of the techniques we learnt in the basic course
(in this case begin with the technique of LAFONTAINE)
2 - do crossed passes from the right shoulder downward to the left and from the left shoulder downward to the right (in this way the two lines will cross about at the height of the heart) 
3 - do Passes from the 3rd eye to the crown
4 (optional) in case put a Hand on shoulder
5 - you can also put both your hands on his head and do as you want lift him 
6 - You can also do Movements on the spine
7 (optional) you can also use Music

A good music is Moonlight Sonata on Glassharp of Beethoven (look on youtube - very good the interpretation of Robert Tiso)

WHAT IS ECSTASY?
Ecstasy is like moving on a vertical plane.
Difference with classical somanmbulism: more spiritual sensations, less images

MUSICAL ECSTASY
Music will be felt differently and deeper in the state of ecstasy
We will do a real musicotherapy
Music will transmit suggestion
Use slow music with a lot of high tones to increase ecstasy

Ideas of the spheres (the music of the spheres)

==========================================

We can also work ecstasy in front of a mirror

Exercise with mirrors in pairs 
History: This exercise is from the "blue pearl" serie. In origin it was done without mirror
Benefits: holding the "ball" 60 secs in front of the coccix will increase magnetism
Goal of this exercise: activating ecstasy in front of the mirror and reinforce magnetism

HOW TO DO IT
One person will be in front and the other behind
This exercise is for creating ecstasy in front of the mirror
Have the person look into himself without blinking
At a certain point have the person press the hands together as pressing a ball behind
do passes on him and activating the points on the spine (occiput and coccyx)
have the person breathing along the body as he/she does doing the charges

========================================
Additional exercise with a mirror

Name of this Exercise: reconnecting earth and sky
Go in front of a mirror.
An assistant will be behind you.
Look now at yourself without blinking
This continous gazing will bring you in a trance. We will call it "Going into the fluid state"
Now you will activate both hemyspheres looking first to the right eye and after to the left eyes and at the same time using Breath + Looking
(assistent do passes)
The assistant will do po passes upward form the third eye to the crown
Progressively we will create ecstasy. At this point the assistant will close the eyes of the subject and have him sitting on a chair
He will do the three sounds O - I - A. In case he can repeat the sound. Each sound is relative to a part of the body
Reconnect to the earth
We will finish with a STOP!

IN ROME THESE TWO EXERCISES HAVE BEEN FUSIONED IN ONE AND WE HAVE HAD THE PERSON FALL A LITTLE IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSISTANTS
=========================================

In the former exercise we saw the passes to activate the spine
These movements are the same that we can use to work after to heal the spine

EXERCISE to heal pains on the spine
USE: every pain on the spine, discopathy
1 - Ask the person where he feels pain
2 - Find the point feeling it even yourself 
3 - Note - You can find the point even moving the hand along the spine and seeing where you have reactions
4 - Create a magnetic state (activate the parasympathetic system)
5 - Lay one hand over the occiput and the other one over the cocciput

Dont touch
We can even switch hands so we will see different reactions and how polarities will affect the results
We will see a reaction in the spine
After you will work on the point where is the pain

RESULTS: the pain will go away

===========================================

How to do with Sciatica?
Practically the system is similar.
Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain
These movements we call "butterfly movements" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg
Go always backward
Repeat one or two times

RESULTS: no pain

GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE
The spine is the basic pillar of our organism
We worked on the energy going up.

=============================================

Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on "warming the mercury"
It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy
For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system
- NORMAL
- excitated
this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system

Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown

=============================================

For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner
There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes.
We call this technique "closure of the senses"
The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses

BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way
BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis

LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES
We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques:
Closure of the senses
Technique of the 10 plexuses

CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION
-. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient?
The following: 
1 ° Three passes with the thumb, from the top and the middle of the forehead, over the nose and towards the pit of the stomach;
2 ° Three with the index finger, starting from the middle of the eyebrows;
3 ° Three with the medium, starting from the center of the ears.
4. Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together.

EQUALIZATION
. How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force?
Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes.

. Do we always have to do these nine passes?
No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected.

MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS)
What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes?
Those are :
1 ° between the eyes. 
2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw
3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.)
4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.)
5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.)
6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.)
7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.)
8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.)
9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.)

Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head
- At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass?
Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another.
. Why do you have to make no more than nine passes?
The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force.
- What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force?
To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node.
This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh.

===============================================

We will now see what we call Non Verbal Hypnotism and introduce a new theme

DEMO OF NON VERBAL HYPNOTHERAPY
(with hypnodrama)
This demo will be done in the following way

1 - NON VERBAL HYPNOTISM
2 - WHEN THE PERSON REACT PUT HIM ON THE FLOOR DOING "HYPNODRAMA"

This technique will be explained better in the day of tomorrow.

===============================================
END DAY 1
===============================================

INTRODUCTION TO NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION
We enter now in the world of "non verbal communication"
Each day we communicate with other people and we have many elements that influence other people:
Proxemics: movement of the body
Paralinguistics: sounds, tones etc
Gaze: our gaze
Magnetic passes and gestures
Touch
SOUND

DEMO:
Just using small sounds and small touches a person is put on the floor
We do it to show it as the sense of balance is fundamental
The mental structure is connected to physical structure
================================================
Example of something similar in the art performance.
In many modern art performances the performers try to create reactions in the spectators
Even in theatre.
Peaple sit down and reactions are created
People must be well seated in order to receive the most stimulations
================================================
HOW TO TEST IF THE PERSONNIS ENTERING IN STATE?
There are two basic ways of testing
1-checking the balance of a person
2-with the use of catalepsies
For checking the balance we put a hand on the shoulder of the person or we do small touches.
================================================
DEMO and exercise
Goal: Discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles.
When we approach somebody from different sides we will have different reactions on the different sides

1 - Put a person in the center in static position
2 - Approach her from different sides
Right Left Front
3 - Do thes emovements in order to create a circle around (doing a circle remind us of the magnetic circle we did yesterday - circles are used in every tradition). A circle will feel him as you are "around" him
ALSO
Do small sounds
Use proxemics near and far

See what happens
Look for reactions

After wake up

Don't touch to much the person in thsi first exercise.
================================================
Q&A
Can I do with a lying person?
Yes you can do, but you must be very expert. In reality when a person is standing each time we see his/her reaction in the balance and how he she holds it. When a person is laying we can only guess
================================================
NOTE
Different types of people
Some people will react more, some people less.
Sometimes we must REDUCE stimulations and we will have stronger reactions
Notice how these stimulations are something you cannot oppose to
How can you oppose yourself to a sound?
We see for exemple that music can work even on very rational people.
=================================================
Step 2 in this exercise
Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction)
OR
try catalepsy with the head (or the arm)


====================================================
There are two ways of doing non verbal hypnosis:
Accompanying
Symbolic
We advise not to be completely symbolic as you risk to lose yourself in excessive thought and symbolism
It is better to mix the two styles
You will follow your client through some main axes
=====================================================
MAIN AXES:
Approaching (Attack) / Going Away (Abandon)
Touching or arriving from the right side (father) / Touching or arriving from the left side mother
Direct touch (male) / Soft touch (female) / no touch or just small touch (for people that doesnt like touch)
The same you can have in sounds
=====================================================
In combination with the former elements you can use "words without a meaning"
These are words as DOS, DOOH, DEST that have no specific meaning and the mind will create imagination around these sounds
=====================================================
INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL
Neurological interpretation
The Right side is Rational
The Left side is Emotional
Psychological interpretation
Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational

Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward.
At the same time you turn around him

Interpretation of the reactions:
May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before.
Reaction to the Front can be confrontation
Notice how people react when you use also "proxemics" (going near and far)
Turning around remind us of a circle
Sounds are slow or fast.
Remember to stop sometimes in your movements

Use also the principles of the four steps therapy:
- Concentration of the mind
- Hypnosis
- Solutions
- Amplifying solutions

GENERAL RULE
When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases

IMPORTANT
This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively.
For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol
In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively
In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions


As a general rule you should have:
PRESENCE
and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions.
IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis
If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively
In the group dont oblige people
Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate

HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT

You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a "hard" therapist, a "sweet" therapist or a "detached" therapist
(remember the SATIR figures)
We can say YOU DO NOTHING. Is the client that reacts

CHANGE PARTNER
=========================================
At the end you can add HYPNODRAMA
As the person has catalepsy lift the two hands, put them in front
You can suggest (if you want) with words that the right hand is the father side and the left the feminine side

==================================================
HYPNODRAMA
METHOD 1: Mixed with non verbal hypnosis
USE: to open the mind and evocate emotional reactions. It is a sort of CRISIS that the client see from the exterior.
HISTORY: the first to develop this technique (the part with the two hands) has been the french psychologist Messinger.

Exercise of the hypno-drama

1 - Have the person thinking to a problem
2 - induce the person with non verbal ways
3 - put him on the floor
4 - continue with the hypnodrama
5 - when catalepsy ends he can open his eyes
How do you feel?
6 - use a light to enhance even more the enlarged awareness state the client has

=========================================
FOCALIZING THE CLIENT on the problem
We must focalize the client on his problem if we want to get results.
It can be done with a former dialogue
=========================================
Why we finish with the hypnodrama?
Because our goal is bringing the person to the center.
With the hypnodrama we bring the two halves together
==========================================
The imbalances reveal in fact us something that is not equally weighted in both sides
They can correspond to an excessivity

SYMBOLISM
True and false symbolism
Exactly as in society, sometimes some symbols can be identified just with one side of the individuals, while in reality are of the whole person.
When they are identified with just one side they become charged psychologically.

True symbolism: Archetypes
derivated (or false) symbolism: archetypes charged with psychological significance

Example 1:
the cross: symbolism
Archetype: 2 dimensions that cross themselves, the human being
Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : to suffer , it is as the symbolism is owned by just a part of the human being

Example 2:
The mother
Archetype: the earth
Derivated (false or psychological) symbolism : what is conceived about own human mother. In reality is not the archetype of the mother. It is a part of you that monopolizes the archetype.

Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it)
Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself


ARCHETYPE (ex verticality)
it exist into the Non verbal self
False symbolism (excessive rigidity)

We can increase 
==========================================
METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS
You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table
Put the two hands in front
create one or two times attraction between your two hands
have the hands coming together

NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a "history" that will help the reaction as for example:
Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations
Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations
Or just right and left are two different energies coming together

You can put together some more ideas
============================================
THE SWAYING TEST

What is "the test"?
The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer
It is "the human pendulum".
USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive

DOING THE TEST
Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer
1 stay by side
2 imagine something you desire / or not
3 did you notice you moved?
4 close the eyes
5 repeat
6 You can do on the four problems area
Health
Family
Relationship
Success
You will discover where the person has most problems

USE THE TEST FOR SILENT QUESTIONS
You can use the test to do "silent questions"
Do your inner mind thinks it can help in these therapy
Do you think we can get results in these session?
Is it something relating to your childhood?
(if you want you can even repeat, before you write down the question. You do in two ways)

==============================
END OF THE SECOND DAY
==============================

USE THE TEST FOR REGRESSION

USE THE TEST FOR ASKING THE INNER MIND
In this case lower your hand at the height of the solar plexus of the person you have in front
In this case answer to your silent questions can be even easier


We can also do the "silent test" - we write some questions 

================================

INTRODUCING SOUNDS AND METACOMMUNICATIONAL CODE IN THERAPY AND INDUCTIONS
We will introduce:
sounds
Breathing
The sounds OH and EEEH (OH is connected to EARTH and EEH is connected to sky)

1 - come to a person using sound
2 - use magnetism and catalepsy
3 - introduce a non verbal code Breathing - use also the sounds O I
4 - Lay the person down using the sound
5 - add passes 
6 - wake up the person 

EXERCISE


============================================
THIRD DAY


FLUIDIFICATION

BALANCING HPA AXIS

BALANCING HEMYSPHERES

THREE COLOURS ( I A O )

These are for preparing the client
After these are some ideas of working
FLUIDIFICATION
WORK ON SOLAR PLEXUS AND THE POINT OF PROBLEM

WORK ON THE OPPOSITE POINT



Introduction to magnetism
DEMO
SKIN PROBLEMS
and explanation of 
FLUIDIFICATION
and
POSITIVE FASCINATION

Demonstration

Exercise
Have the person entering the "fluidic" (magnetic) state.
A very simple way is the "fluidification".



FLUIDIFICATION 
USE: prepare the client for magnetism /activate a first parasympathetic reaction
ORIGIN: Italian magnetic healers (Muscolo)
HERMETIC INTERPRETATION: first activation of the etheric body
PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: activation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM

IMPORTANT POINTS 
Note: before doing fluidification we can do in case the "closure of the senses" or some passes
hold his feet (rings) and ask if sensation go up
NOTE sensation passes through the hands that must touch his/her legs 
sensation goes to the top of the head and after comes back
RESULTS: after "fluidification" the client will be more sensible to his inner reactions

MAGNRETC MAPS
Explaining of the emotions iside the MAGNETIC MAPS: Rage, 
Presentation on a theory on the work of magnetism. A research done by a finnish University shows the different zone of activation in the body

FOUR TYPES
Presentation of four types
Choleric
Lymphatic
Sanguine
Menlancholic
=========================================================

EXPLANATION OF MAGNETIC TYPES
For doing well magnetism we must first of all understand that our glands and in general every organ of our body can be hyper-active or hypo-active.
Se we have a first big split
HYPER
HYPO
Is the client coming to us HYPO or HYPER?
Ex. Hyperthyroidism/Hypothyroidism

Many times we observe that 
HYPO is also connected to increased actrivation of the PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEM
HYPER to the increased activation of the ORTO-SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM

We can have even TYPES OF PERSONALITY that connect to these different types of ACTIVATION
CHOLERIC (Sympathico-tonic)
LYMPHATIC / PHLEGMATIC (parasympatthico-tonic)
SANGUINE (ambo-tonic)
MELANCHOLIC (dia-tonic)

Try to judge from how the client move a react what type is it.

NOTE: The ancient connected the four types of personality to the four elements. Choleric FIRE. Very active. Hyperexcitation.
Phlegmatic WATER. Submissive, Passive. He can do a lot of attention to his inner sensations. Sanguine AIR. Very sensitive and capable odf reacting. Melancholic EARTH. Material is his sensations, less emotions. More specific thinking.

BURN-OUT
How to deal with BURN OUT. We can think that many times burn-out happens in life after excess activity
We will do a TWO STEPS THERAPY: 
First: give energy to the person and make her active
Second: find (may be with regression) the reason why s/he was so active. Sometimes we can have IDENTIFICATIONS (I feel worthless, I feel powerless etc... behind the extreme work of the person. In a next day we will see how to de-identify)

========================

HOW TO WORK ON PROBLEMS
When you do laying of hands keep them between 3 and 7 minutes
Wait for reactions, the body must give ACCESS
Finish with a positive suggestion (DI PISA Method)

MAGNETIC POINTS
When we heal we work
1 - both on general systems
2 - both on the part. One of the way of working on the part is the "opposite point"
Two types of opposite point. 
OR 
passing through the person
OR
to the opposite side


=============================================================
MOVING THERAPY
=============================================================

INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENT LEVELS of MOVING THERAPY
Level 1 - the Trabona Method
USE: to balance the person
HISTORY: Trabona is a student of dr. Paret that created this method that is very effective
METHOD: you will tell to the client that "everyone has a pendulum inside himself". Or "everyone has his own rhytm". Begin creating movement in your client.
Add magnetic passes (you will discover he will have a higher sensitivity)

For level two, that is a sort of a self-hypnosis, we will search for a desire we want to work on:
1st we create the oculomotor blockage (optional)
2nd thinking to something we desire we see, going through three different desires, which one blocks you more the eyes 

Level 2 - Modified Akstein Method with non verbal hypnosis
USE: For doing a self-hypnosis on yourself
HISTORY: Akstein was a researcher that created Terpsichore Trance Therapy. He highly valued the work of Mesmer and he feels what he did was on his line
He used music to create release state
We agree with many of his tenets, but we prefer to use non verbal hypnotism as it is more corresponding to what we do

Procedure:
Begin with Trabona method a little to create a state of disposition

Have the person look at a light and thinking what s/he desires.
begin the movement (when looking at a light only back and forth, otherwise the trace will be not so good) and at a certain point ask her to breath from the nose and exhale from the mouth
After have the person close the eyes - begin as in Trabona method
Continue with non-verbal stimulations
This method will create as a crisis but with a different way of doing.
It is very good for self-hypnosis. We can create a movement similar to the crisis even without the negative emotion that normally we use to go in regression create catalepsy and after solve it 


==============================================

Introducing strong Somnambulism
What is the key for deep somnambulism?
It is very easy. We will before create ecstasy and after we will do a "non verbal induction"
Ecstasy + Non Verbal

It is easy that people doing such exercises has strong reaction

SIDE RESULTS: Sometimes people goes into some sort of parallele reality (past lifes)
In these case work as usual. The advantage of a past life is that the person can see how his life will evolve and the final consequences. We can see the past life also as a "metaphor" of his actual life. And working on the past life we can solve problems in the actual life 

=============================================

Doing outside exercises about presence (stop etc...)
NOTE: presence outside is much more stronger

=============================================
DAY 4

Explanation of earthly type and airy type

The four meditations
Water
Including this exercise:
In the ROOM
Mirror exercise
2 people one will look himself in the mirror and the second will be an assistant
at the begin we work normally, looking at the center
after we begin inhaling and exaling clenching the fists and we look the right eye and after the left one
We can give ourself a command: interlochl your finger and tell yourself blocked hands
After assume 
presence position with interlocked fingers
charges with open eyes (3 times)
And DEVELOPING THE FORCE
Earth
Fire
Air

=============================================

Presentation of the muscolar preferences
Earth - In the now
Air - Projected in the future

Water - we observe gaze and positions of the hands
Fire - Focusing - we see very well when a person indicate somebody

Question: In NLP we have three types Visual (similar to focusing) Kynesthesic (similar to watery)
What about Auditory types?
Answer: in general introverts are auditory. In psychology an introvert is somebody speaking with himself
We can recognise auditory from :
1 - they speak with the left ear
2 - they are closed (arms / legs)

3 - we can recognise them on the spot because they have a lot of MICROMOVEMENTS

================================================

What we have seen were MUSCULAR PREFERENCES

Now we will see how magnetic passes can change muscular preferences
Exercise
Check axially where a person is stronger
Do passes from the weaker side. The person will become stronger

Check speed in answer to fast movement toward the cheek (boxing position - but with the head turned in order to use only one eye)
==================================================

DEMO OF WEIGHT LOSS TECHNIQUE

==================================================

Afternoon

==================================================
DEMONSTRATION OF MAGNETISM FOR WEIGHT LOSS
==================================================

SELF HYPNOSIS WITH WATER
Attentive explanation.
The concept of INCORPORATION

Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis
Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus)
Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball
Drink the water
EXERCISE OF WEIGHT LOSS 
USES: inside a protocol for losing weight
ELEMENTS: we eat both for nervous/psychological reason than for metabolic reason. We must work on both.

It is Preceded by exercise of the water and
WORKING ON THE THREE SYSTEM:
Endocrine
Nervous
Psychological

And after
Solar Plexus and Front
Wrists

PROCEDURE
First do a small hypnosis
oculomotor blockage in case
- you see how you want to be
- you see a mirror you enter inside the mirror
- you feel the sensation
Now you begin to breath with TAURUS system
If you have somebody helping you he will move your head.
Otherwise you will do it

Now if you have another person he will tell you that you are very capable
And that in afew seconds you will open the eyes and see in the water as in a chrystal ball what you want to achieve
Eyes open - drink the water

Passes accompanying the water entering
And now magnetic passes for weight loss

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
Epiphysis and thyroid (send energy)
Epyphysis and Pancreas
Epyphysis and genitals

NERVOUS SYSTEM
Passes
Calming passes with hand behind in a lower position
Do them at 
third eye
shoukders
heart
belly

PSYCHOLOGY
Do the principal organs as stomach liver splees intestines

Touch now solar plexus and forehead

WRISTS (touching the wrists as you are sending energy)
In Chinese Medicine is said that all meridians can be found at the wrists
But this concept exists also in the western medicine 

Repeat three times and after wake up the person

REMEMBER
Magnetism must be treated as sacred
It is Better to do it in silence
We must be in the NOW
We can use verbal suggestions but only at the begin.
Try to be SILENT

In this way we will create a deep trance
The mind will diffuse itself in the body.

HOW TO LEARN IT - EXERCISE
It is possible to doo in circles sometimes
To learn better be in circle with the master demostrating
After students can learn by themselves

MAGNETISM
In some way with the former technique we worked with the body.
GENERAL PRINCIPLE: Passes when done near an organ will harmonize or stimulate it
It is as we "speak directly with the body"

=========================================================

Can this exercise be done even for different goals?
Yes, this exercise can be done even for different goals
You can put whatever you want inside the glass of water (as suggestion)

=========================================================
DOING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE GLASS OF WATER ALONE BY YOURSELF

Decide what you want and realize a first light hypnosis
Begin breathing intensevely (you can also use the paradigm of taurus)
Have the person open the eyes and after looking in the water looking at it as looking into a chrystal ball
Drink the water
Do passes on yourselves

and after 
- block your ears and let yourself going deeply
- If you are in the evening you can go to sleep
- an other method will be presented and will be with movement and will be done the fifth day

==========================================================
FAST RELEASE TECHNIQUE
DEMO of crossed breathing
followed by Hypno-Drama

Afternoon
Release technique based on crisis and called crossed breathing

NAME OF THE TECHNIQUE: Technique of the crossed breathing
EFFECTS: Strong crisis, fast effects
USE: alternative to classic crisis technique, when you work a second time with somebody etc...
NOTE: the technique of the crossed breathing, when done with the legs, can have a use for SEXUAL problems
PHYSIOLOGICAL REASONS WHY THE PERSON GET HEALED: Polyvagal theory could be behind the reasons for the good results of such a technique

Have the person think to a problem
In case we can increase it
What problems give (gave) to your life?
How would your life be without it?
Woould you like to become free?

HOW TO DO IT:
Create before a state of fascination
Tel to the client
Follow me
Inhale and close your arms
Exhale and open your ams
This technique create a confusion in the mind as we breath in and out in a way very different from what we would do normally
With words and non verbal communication we invite to be free 
After we can continue on the floor
on the floor the legs of the subject wil be put in position
And he will have reaction on the floor

This technique is also good for self crisis.
You can do it by yourself and 

=============================================
We can do the Campanelli Method at the end to balance
Tell the client 
Tell the client to close his eyes and keep the mind free
1 - touching occiput and forehead
2 - warm blow
3 - turning the head
4 - touching head and sternum together
5 - movement on the arms 
6 - again head and sternum
7 - again movement on the arms
8 - keep a moment a hand on the front and the other one over the belly (without touching)
9 - end of exercise

===============================================

TECHNIQUE FOR STOP SMOKING
CAMPANELLI
Look to the slide

===============================================

DI PISA
Di Pisa used a method putting a person "against" the smoking habit
Look the person into the eyes and speak of the problem of smoke (first fascination)
Lower his body (he will feel a bad taste at the throat)
Put him up - touch the solar plexus
Make him hypersemnsitive to smell
You will tell him that in a moment we will lighten a sigarette
first time he smokes it will taste as nothing
second time will taste as Hay
third time he will cough
Continue keeping the ligthned sigarette under his nose so smoke will enter
You can repeat with a second sigarette
Finish with direct suggestion looking him into the eyes

=============================================

TECHNIQUE FOR ALLERGY
Allergy and Food intolerance are very similar.
They are as a "PHOBIA" of the immune system
We can treat allergy with the technique of the LIGHT and the ball behind the occiput.
The ideal is to know the FIRST TIME a person got allergy
We can after do a technique where we will have our client find something similar to the allergene but with no effect
We will have imagine to eat progressively less of the product of no effect and more of the allergene.
Percentage will change 90% 80% etc...
Progressively you will create change

=================================================

Gypsy self hypnosis what it is

ANSWERS

===============================================

Exercise at the mirror putting away false identifications
USE: this is an advanced exercise. Its goal is putting away the false personalities that are parasiting ourself. 
METHOD: to do that we will 
A get with a mirror to a state of high PRESENCE at ourself
At this pooint we will see the image in the mirror and understand that the I we are seeing in the mirror has a false idea about himself

This exercise is divided in various steps

1 - look at yourself in the mirror
2 - create the first reactions

3 - WORK ON BOTH HEMYSPHERES
begin breathing and at the same time clench fists looking before right eye and after left eye

4 - CREATE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTION AND DISCHARGE
inhale fully, your breats must be full
begin moving arms as putting away tension
exale fully until your lungs will be empty
REPEAT 2 or 3 times

5 - Now look the YOU in the mirror
Think - this person think to be (ex. imperfect)
You observe but you see that in reality a just an idea this person in the mirror has
Ask: what does this person more want in the universe? The answer will come in form of a sensation
And in this moment you will feel FREE

You can work on different identifications
- being imperfect
- being inadequate
- being incomplete

============================================

Fifth day

We will delve a moment in Hermeticism and Quantum Physics 

SYMBOLS
The first symbol is the circle, in some way it is the whole, the DAO
It divides itself in sun and moon because we live in an EXPLICATE order 
This division will create soon and moon, the two opposites, because the word is done of opposites

The circle with a line is the symbol of the salt and it is the symbol of the body

QUANTUM PHYSICS
Why we speak of an implicate order behind the explicate?
Implicate and explicate exemples
the double slit experiment
example of the light
exemple of elections
We can speak of quantum systems

Even our mind is a quantum system 
Your body is an implicate order
We will see now an exercise to understand it

Quantum exercise to put away an emotion

We continue exploring ourself
Notice now the space between thoughts
Explicate and implicate again? Who is behind your thoughts?

Now we come back to the symbols and we see the symbols of the elements, one arrow up fire arrow down water etc...
Lets become conscious of the elements
We can develop conscioussnes of the 4 elements in the body
The 4 elements can be also kynestetical ways to experiment reality

Exercise of awareness between breathing. Do attention on the space between each breath
What is between each breath?
There is YOU

Hermeticism and quantum physics are linked. There is a relationship between hermeticism, magnetism and quantum physics
Schopenauer is in fact the key because he highly influenced the group of scientists that was at the basis of the "quantum paradygm"

exercise

===========================================================

TRUE AND DERIVATIVE SYMBOLISM

The symbols as the vertical, the circle, are primitive and archetipal symbols
Jung had called them "archetypes"
But there is a "derivate somnambulism" that is based on the original symbol that can take MEANINGS from experiences
an example is the symbol of the cross. It is an archetype, but in the christian Religion it takes further meaning
Another exemple are the symbol of the MOTHER and the FATHER
They are archetypes, but they get psychologically coloured.

We have the true symbol, but education can "CHARGE" in some way the symbol.

Even our hands can express symbolism.
Pointing hand - directive and indicative
Open hand - receiving and harmonizing
Small distant touch - in some way we stay "detached"

Archetyply, the Pointing hand many types is related to the father/male figure, the receiveing hand to the mother/female figure
The psychology of our relationships with these figures will give "colour" to the original archetypical symbolism (Benemeglio).
It means the person will search or refuse some kind of touches
Furter traumatism can lead the person in not wanting any touch.

We must always work experimentally.

We have three styles of hypnotherapy and touch
Directive
Mother
Detached
These three types are also in Virginia Satir that observed the existence of three types. But they are also very ancient and you can find (at least in the definition of the first two) in every tradition

We will do now a demo of an induction with specific touches

PROCEDURE
Go near a person.
TEST where she/he reacts best
Use the same type  of stimulation

NOTE: it is important to understand that it is not only your touch, but your WHOLE BEHAVIOUR that will create reaction in your client
When you have a new client discover which approach is the best one.
When a person will be in deep hypnosis in reality s/he will reacts to very symbol in a balanced way
But for arrivig to this level there is a path.
First: a  subject will have PREFERENCES and we must understand them
Second. in the course of interactions these preferences can change

USE : to adapt to the person. To use the type of touch/approach that most suits his/her personality

AFTERNOON
The mirror exercise of de-identification is very important to understand that we tend to enter in some identifications and mantain them always
We must learn how to put away our identifications
Otherwise in our life we will repeat always the same pattern.

Reference to the mirror exercise of yesterday to put away identification
The Enneagram can be that
The idea of the enneagram starts from 9 types of personality
It can be even be read in the opposite way.
What is that causes this 9 types of personalities?

We can look at our different self identifications:
may be we have FEAR
- of being imperfect
- of being inadequate
- of being incomplete
...
...

Explanation of what is the enneagram.
The enneagram can be read as a MAP of compulsions.
The enneagram can be represented as diffferent personalities around a circle.
At the center there is ESSENCE 
In this course we give just a brief overview as more time would be needed

We can understand very easily how we adopt always the same behaviour

Memorization of the enneagram types
1- perfectionist . You think the final judgement in the classic ichonography with an angel dividing good people from bad people - The sword is similar to a 1
2 - altruist . Two people, one will help the other one
3 - manager . imagine a triangle as the point of an arrow that go toward a target
4 - romantic . imagine the four walls of a room where a lot of emotions can happen
5 - Hermit/Researcher . imagine the 5 . At the center one point
6 - skeptical . Think that skeptical and 6 both begin by S
7 - artist . Imagine an artist drawing a 7 as a painting and convinced that everything is under control
8 - Boss/Politic . Notice an 8. It is a closed number. Everything under control
9 - Diplomatic . He invited all other types to him to create "harmony" 

Mental Association will boost the power of your memory.

What are the association you want to let go?

1 - fear of being imperfect
2 - fear of being dependant (so he tries to help to avoid it) (fear of being worthless)
3 - fear of not doing enough
4 - fear of being inadequate
5 - fear of having no value (therefore he depreciate the body and stays in thinking)
6 - fear of being not enough (being loner)
7 - fear of being incomplete
8 - fear of not having control (being powerless)
9 - fear of love (being loveless)

These mask must fall down
When at home repeat the exercise of yesterday on all these masks

Exams, even two groups of two people together in order to do faster

==================================================

ADDED DURING THE EXAM: Explaining exercice of self hypnosis.
putting a desire in water and after create movement in the person.
practically we could call it: terpsichore trance therapy self hypnosis enhanced with non verbal hypnosis


ALSO ADDED:
Similar to hypnodrama: put the two hand of your patient in a way that the two index fingers are somewhat indicating.
Have the person reacting until the catalepsy goes away

==================================================

WHAT IS CLAIRVOYANCE?
Clairvoyance is accessing  our inner sense
USE: Increase our sensitivity
Now, doing the exercise before doing the exercise of Indian Self Hypnosis we will increase the results 
We will do clairvoyance in group of two in front of a mirror

step 1 have the person in front of the mirro closing the eyes and falling backward with magnetic attraction
step 2 have him look at himself in the mirror - at the same time the person behind switches on the light in the smartphone (the torch) and holds a little more high than the head of the other person
step 3 have the person in front of the mirror looking into the light (30-40 secs)
step 4 have him looking in front and ask for clairvoyance
STOP
Repeat changing couple

==================================================

And finally we do Indian Selfhypnosis
USE: relaizing something in the universe
HISTORY: Dr. Paret learnt it from the fampus hypnotis Ormond Mc Gill that in turn learnt it in India
MAIN POINTS: we will work on the THREE LEVELS. Head, Breast (the heart), Belly. Hermetically we touch the three main zone. At the end we go a moment in our third eye that is as a zero point (in quantum physics the 0 point is a point that nervertheless contains an incredible energy
METHOD
1 - see what you desire in front of you
2 - send an emotion from your earth into the scene
3 - connect the scene to your nombril
4 - begin some "power breathing"
5 - look at your third eye
6 - blow your desire into the universe
