  "title": "Homoeopathy and Magnetism: Revolutionary Approaches to Medicine",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the alliance between Magnetism and Homoeopathy, two alternative systems of healing that emerged as a response to the traditional and orthodox Official Medicine. Magnetism's inventor Rutter believed his Magnetiscope machine could solve various medical problems, but it ultimately never gained widespread use due to its unpredictable behavior. On the other hand, Homoeopathy, with its strategy of using \"infinitesimal doses,\" emerged as one of the prominent challengers to Official Medicine's rule, just like Magnetism did.",
  "content": "The magnetizers were trying to supplant the old mode of treatment by Magnetism, and the homoeopathists were endeavoring to do the very same thing by means of Homoeopathy; and although Hahnemann himself had belief in Magnetism, since it employed a means that seemed almost as little ‘material’ as his ‘infinitesimal doses,’ still the ‘globule’ and the ‘pass’ were rivals for public favour, and both of them aimed at universal sovereignty.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the competition between homoeopathy and magnetism brought about a revolution in the cure of diseases, shaking the absolute authority of orthodox medicine. And though the introduction of patent medicines and curative fads has led to some noxious innovations by \"regular\" practitioners, Hanemann considered animal magnetism or mesmerism a useful curative agent that imparts remedial power to patients through a well-disposed person's touch and will."
