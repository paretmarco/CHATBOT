  "title": "What was the treatment for an epileptic patient suffering from peculiar symptoms and what was the role of nitrate of silver and cuprum ammoniatum in the treatment?",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the treatment of a patient with a peculiar case of epileptic seizures. After convulsions, instead of falling into a coma as usual, the patient became restless and fidgety for several hours. The treatment began with low diet and quarter-grain doses of nitrate of silver. However, as the patient's condition worsened, she needed to be frequently bled and the nitrate of silver was discontinued. Instead, the patient took quarter-grain doses of cuprum ammoniatum, which caused nausea. To prevent this, creosote was added, allowing the patient to increase to one-grain doses.",
  "content": "On the 16th of May she was bled to eight ounces; on the 20th, to eight ounces; and on the 23rd ten ounces were taken away. The nitrate of silver was being increased all this time gradually. She took this medicine for six weeks from its first commencement; he never gave it during a longer period, for fear of discolouring the skin. On the 27th of May, the fits being as frequent as before, though the nitrate of silver was given in two-grain doses, that medicine was discontinued, and the cuprum ammoniatum, in quarter of a grain doses, was commenced, and given three times a-day, the dose being increased by a quarter of a grain twice a week. On the 5th of June she was taking onegrain doses of the medicine; this produced sickness, though, as has been stated, she bore two-grain doses of the nitrate of silver. As the copper produced this nausea, the dose was diminished to three-quarters of a grain; and as this now, also, produced sickness, on the 10th she took one minim of creosote with each dose of it, and this effectually prevented the nausea, and the copper was again increased to grain doses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the patient underwent a gradual increase in the administration of nitrate of silver and cuprum ammoniatum. The latter was successful in reducing the nausea that was caused by its use when combined with one minim of creosote. With the use of this agent, the patient showed a remarkable improvement, which was attributed to its effectiveness in curing the ailment."
