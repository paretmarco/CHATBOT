  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, instructions for the sixth exercise were detailed, explaining how to reach the plane of eternal progression. To complement this practice, Exercise Seventh is described as optional but highly advisable. This exercise consists of placing your hands in a milkpan with cold water and a cent between them while standing erect, inhaling through nostrils and exhaling through your mouth while whistling. This exercise aims to revitalize and energize your body.",
  "content": "Fill it with enough cold water to cover what is ordinarily called the wrist bone, you find it, as you look at your wrist, a little bone sticking out. That's it! To that wrist bone the water is to reach and half-way up, but not above it. In the center between your hands which must not touch, you place a cent, not a dollar. Place your hands in the water, stand erect and if stooping be careful that your spinal column does not bend, but simply stand bending only at the hips. Now inhale through your nostrils, as usual, a deep, full breath, pucker up your mouth, with tongue flat in your mouth, just as if you were going to whistle. You can whistle, if you want to. Whistle out all you can through the mouth, emptying your lungs to their utmost and take another breath, through nostrils, again exhaling through mouth, and again inhale and exhale.",
  "last_phrase": "Breathing exercises like this can have a positive impact on our overall well-being. By practicing this exercise daily before breakfast, you may experience increased energy, clearer thinking, and a greater sense of calm. Remember to stand straight, keep your hands apart, and focus on the cent while you inhale and exhale deeply. Additionally, using water to help with breathing is an effective technique to further boost its effectiveness. With a little patience and consistency, this exercise may soon become an essential part of your daily routine."
