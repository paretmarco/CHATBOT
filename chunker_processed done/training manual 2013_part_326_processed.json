  "title": "\"Regaining Control: Developing Self-Consciousness and Overcoming Automatic Behavior\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we saw the importance of speaking while listening to your own self, which helps in attaining self-consciousness. The general idea is to align decisions with resultant actions, which requires controlling one's automatic responses through awareness. This part discusses a simple scenario of a student deciding to study despite the tempting distractions. It emphasizes the need to gain control over automatic behavior and rise above unconsciousness to remember ourselves, a concept introduced by Gurdjeff. The goal is to have our conscious and unconscious possibilities at our disposal by regaining control over our actions.",
  "content": "At that point, an “internal struggle” will commence, one on which the student’s behaviour is going to depend. If we make a methodical effort, firstly to dominate the insignificant impulses, and then to do so in respect of impulses of greater importance, we are going to gradually ensure for ourselves the swift and easy subordination of automatic comportment to the representations put forward by reflection, and to the development of a central principle in man. It is thus an issue of regaining ourselves, as well as gestures and movements which are otherwise going to be piloted by our unconscious self. REMEMBERING OURSELVES Achieving control over one’s activities is a stage in the process of man’s reawakening to his own self. It is a very straight road, the aim of which is to soar above automatic conduct and unconsciousness, so as to reach higher levels in which we might have the totality of our conscious and unconscious possibilities at our disposal. Gurdjeff used to speak of the need “to remember ourselves”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, regaining control over one's actions is an essential step towards achieving self-awareness and consciousness. By making a conscious effort to dominate our impulses, we can gradually subdue our automatic behavior and awaken to our full potential. Remembering ourselves is the key to unlocking these possibilities, and by doing so, we can soar above unconsciousness and reach higher levels of consciousness in our lives."
