  "title": "\"The Power of Look-Centered Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the fascinating process of look-centered therapy, a technique used to transport patients into a state of \"non-thinking,\" where symptoms disappear, and the mind is reset. Prof. Di Pisa, who appeared on a TV show, and Our Own Nice-based School have both conducted scientific studies on this phenomenon. The goal of this technique is to help patients reach a state without consciousness of the \"ego,\" separate from mental programs. The previous 200 tokens explain how the unconscious always works for a person's well-being and interest, and how the success of this therapy is not just mere suggestion, allowing the patient to experience a new life dimension.",
  "content": "It is the equivalent of resetting the mind. Within that context, for a period of time that might last more or less long, the fascinated person attains a state which is devoid of consciousness of the “ego”, that is, the totality of our mind and our automatic mental programs. The person concerned would then be “beyond the trance”. The Fascination which is carried out on a person is indisputably something that acts at an ocular level, by creating a kind of “trance” for the subject on whom one is operating. However, we are in a state of trance even in other situations. We might for example be captivated by objects or by persons, or even by our thoughts in which we drown. The majority of people is indeed totally gripped, “fascinated” by their own mental mechanisms. This is the reason why the same mechanisms are invariably reiterated, and why a problem is preserved and perpetuated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and recognizing the state of fascination and trance that we may experience in different situations, we can intervene in our own mental mechanisms to break free from the automatic programs that hold us back. We can also address our symptoms directly, using them as a path to access and communicate with the parts of our brain that generate them, allowing us to utilize the crisis as a cure and move forward towards healing and growth."
