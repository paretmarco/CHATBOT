  "title": "\"The Symbolism of Characters on a Boat\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section of the text, we see the symbolism of the boat and its characters come together to represent the transport of the sevenfold conscious self, freed from its primal instincts. The young Hercules, situated above Mars, represents the free will that must choose between two paths, pleasure and virtue, while the captain and helmsman symbolize the individual spirit and conscience that guide the journey. An old man dressed in white completes the triangle, representing wisdom. Together, they navigate the forking paths of life towards a wisely balanced will.",
  "content": "One represents Pleasure, Complacency, and Comfort, and the other Work, Frugality, and Virtue. Hercules, at the beginning of his trials, had to choose between two different ways of regarding life. Therefore the young hero represents the free arbiter, and he is situated, appropriately, in the forward part of the boat above Mars, who can only put his powers to use through the deterministic force of will. That boat represents the organism that transports the sevenfold conscious self, freed from its primitive instincts (the Cyclops that falls into the sea). In reality, there are eight characters still on board, one of whom is a king with a crown and a sceptre in his hand. He is the captain in command of the crew, the individual spirit, lord of the composite self. He stands near the helmsman, who is the conscience, and whose basis is the sense of compassion that links him to everything else in the Universe (religion in the highest sense of the word). An old man dressed in white forms the third point of the triangle with these two characters.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this allegory illustrates the human struggle between pleasure and virtue and the importance of exercising our free will to choose the path that leads to a purified and flourishing self. It also emphasizes the role of conscience, tradition, compassion, and the captain of one's own spirit in navigating life's challenges and defending oneself against external threats. May we all learn from Hercules' example and strive to live a life of frugality, work, and virtue."
