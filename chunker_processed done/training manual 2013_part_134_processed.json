  "title": "\"The Three Nadis and their Alchemical Symbolism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between the nadis of the human body and the Caduceus of Hermes, which is depicted through two serpents coiled around a staff with wings. In Eastern tradition, the two currents of the nadis, Pingala and Ida, are represented by the two snakes, while the wings correspond to the power of conscious flight through higher planes. The three nadis are related and named after alchemical principles of Sulphur and Mercury. In Cabala, the three pillars concept is represented through the central one, which links the earth and the heaven, male and female. The last part also delves into the Jungian Psychology's take on Sulphur and Mercury as Animus and Anima, respectively.",
  "content": "Sometimes the three nadis are related and named also as alchemical sulphur and alchemical mercury [8][9] In Cabala, a Jewish tradition, we can find the same concept of the so called \"three pillars\" where the central one is also , in this case, the way for linking the earth and the heaven, the male and the female. PSYCHOLOGY Even traditional psychology admits the validity of the two principles. For example, according the Jungian Psychology, Sulphur and Mercury are the Animus and Anima. Animus is Sulphur or the Fiery Masculine Principle of the Sun, and Anima is Mercury or the Watery Feminine Principle of the Moon. Moreover, Sulphur is outwardly Sulphur but inwardly Mercury, and just as Mercury is outwardly Mercury but inwardly Sulphur. According to this principle, the Animus is the Soul of a Woman and the Anima is the Soul of a Man. And as the Anima is unconscious in man and the Animus is unconscious in woman, so it is Mercury concealed from Sulphur and Sulphur concealed from Mercury.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the three nadis and the alchemical sulfur and mercury has been explored in various traditions, including Cabala and Oriental Philosophy. Traditional psychology also recognizes the validity of these principles, as seen in Jungian Psychology's animus and anima. The interplay between these principles and their ultimate unification in the Hermetic Vessel represents a powerful symbol for achieving balance and harmony in life."
