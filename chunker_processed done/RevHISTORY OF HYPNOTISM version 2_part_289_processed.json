  "title": "What is Dupotet's view on the inherent properties of magnetism in relation to the will of the magnetiser and infusion of soul, and how does he use this to produce physical and mental effects?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the author delves into the use of the magnetic agent, which he believes can be imbued with the supernatural properties of the soul or spirit. He believed that by separating a force from oneself and depositing it onto an object, the magnetic agent becomes a magical agent capable of producing extraordinary phenomena. The author emphasizes that the will of the magnetiser has little to do with what occurs, as a distinct set of laws governs the manifestations of the magnetic agent. The author's insights into the nature of magnetism and its supernatural properties provide valuable insights for further understanding the connection between science and the occult.",
  "content": "But when the soul or spirit was infused into the Magnetism, he thought that almost any desired result might be obtained; but not so much by a direct operation of the will, as by a distinct set of laws which in that case govern the manifestations of the ‘magnetic agent,’ which then becomes a magical agent. He says:- “By an act of my understanding I separate from myself a force. That force is real, though invisible. Deposited upon anything it fixes itself there as an essence; and soon it exercises an influence upon its surroundings, and magic begins: that is to say extraordinary phenomena take place which strike us with astonishment. It is not that which we will that takes place; no, we have nothing to do with what occurs.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Dupotet's \"magic telegraph\" may seem like a mere parlor trick by today's standards, his understanding of the separation of a force and its invisible influence remains relevant in modern hypnotism. By acknowledging the distinct set of laws that govern the manifestations of this magnetic agent, we can better understand and utilize the power of mental suggestion for physical and mental effects."
