  "title": "Magnetic Healing: Two Cases and Their Dramatic Results",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author recounted two cases of Animal Magnetism in which the patients' conditions improved remarkably. In the last 200 tokens, we see two different cases where the power of Animal Magnetism shines through. In the first case, the author cured a girl suffering from a terrible crisis that left her unable to move. In the second case, a woman with a long history of suffering from pain and unable to walk without crutches was cured after being magnetized. The startling claims made by the author raise questions as to the legitimacy of Animal Magnetism as scientific practice.",
  "content": "I was perfectly right in having taken this resolution, for she struggled long with extraordinary violence, and attempted to put her hand into her mouth to bite it again, but she had been so bound down that she could only get at the sheets, a piece of which she succeeded in tearing off. The somnambulic state at length terminated; her prediction was fulfilled; and she was, to the satisfaction of all the parties interested, from that day cured. Another case of dr. Loewe A woman of forty years of age, worn out by long sufferings, and unable to stir without crutches, resolved on having recourse to animal magnetism, and was conveyed for that purpose to Paris, in a sedanchair. She was two days travelling a distance of thirty-six miles. Several fainting fits came on during this journey. On being magnetized upon her arrival, she fell into somnambulism, but her sleep did not present any lucidity. The magnetic effects, however, produced by the magnetizer were such that he at once declared that, in a few days, the patient would walk without crutches. He therefore invited her to a ball, which he intended giving in his house on a certain day.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism, although controversial, has been known to have produced successful outcomes for some people, as seen in the cases of the  patient cured of somnambulism and the woman who walked without crutches. However, it is important to approach such treatments with caution and consult with trained medical professionals before trying them."
