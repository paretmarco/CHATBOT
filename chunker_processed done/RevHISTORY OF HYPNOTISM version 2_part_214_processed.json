  "title": "The Suppression of Animal Magnetism: A Historical Review.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the obstacles that the practice of Animal Magnetism faced in the 18th century, including the negative publicity generated by their opponents' reports of accidents related to the treatment, which were often exaggerated or misrepresented. This led to the suppression of the practice for a time despite its potential benefits. One of the opponents of Magnetism was Cagliostro, a charlatan whose activities were mistakenly associated with Mesmer, even though the latter strove for transparency and to share his knowledge with others. Despite these challenges, Mesmerism persisted and evolved into modern hypnosis.",
  "content": "Among the hindrances to the progress of Magnetism, Deleuze reckoned the exaggerations of the magnetizers, which caused the facts to be scouted without examination, as utterly impossible, and caused the name of Mesmer to be coupled with that of Cagliostro, whom the public in general looked on as a charlatan. Cagliostro and his differences with Mesmer Deleuze takes trouble to point out how different the behaviour of Mesmer was from that of the mystery-loving, Italian wonder- worker. Cagliostro in any case posed as a unique personality, possessed of powers that were inexplicable and incommunicable; Mesmer instead declared that other people possessed the same powers that he exercised; His great wish was to explain his system to those competent to pronounce on it, and to teach his procedures to those who were worthy and willing to learn them; and even their enemies gave the magnetizers credit for openness and fairness, acknowledging that their cry was always “Come and see; go and try.” Nevertheless, Magnetism was mixed up with things with which it had no necessary connection, and saddled with their pretended sins.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the progress of magnetism was inhibited by various factors, including the exaggerations of magnetizers, the association with charlatans, and the incorporation of unrelated practices such as phrenology. Despite these hindrances, both Mesmer and Cagliostro were capable of performing powerful healings, which should have been the focus of examination. Moving forward, it is crucial to remain open-minded and evaluate magnetism on its own merit without being swayed by external prejudices or claims."
