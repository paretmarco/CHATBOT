  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of muscular tensions as a result of traumatic experiences and how they can be treated through positive fascination. The previous section explores the benefits of this therapy, and in this section, the study's process is explained where a state of fear was induced in patients through a stimulus and then removed through training. The disappearance of symptoms only occurs under certain conditions, and the researchers explain how this works. The text concludes that the therapy of positive fascination is powerful in eliminating symptoms and promoting balance. If you're wondering whether magnetic gaze is hard to learn, the text does not explore this topic.",
  "content": "The disappearance of the symptom only takes place if the action which is engaged in so as to extirpate it takes place within a short period from the moment when the patient is presented again with the scary symptom; if such symptom is not reintroduced, or if the ‘fear-erasing’ training is conducted many hours later, the volunteering patients retain a trace of the fear. Put it in other words, they retain their fear of having to see the squares again. According to the researchers, this fact is explainable on the basis that when the fear is recreated, the memory associated with it crystallizes once more, precisely at that very moment where the memory is fragile and can be removed. It is important to observe the fact that the transcending of the ego which activates the fascination is an even more powerful tool, as it not only frees and eliminates a symptom, but, in several cases, makes room for a total rebalancing. If we want to express it in simpler terms, we might define the therapy of the look as “the positive fascination which chases away the negative fascination derived from life experiences”. - Is it difficult to learn magnetic gaze?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to address the fear-erasing training as soon as possible to entirely eliminate the symptom. Nevertheless, transcending the ego through the magnetic gaze is an even more potent healing tool that not only overcomes the symptom but also leads to complete rebalancing. Learning the magnetic gaze takes a lot of time, work, discipline, and focus to make one's eyes powerful so that the client can feel calm and relaxed. The term animal magnetism is used to describe this powerful effect, which is almost hypnotic in nature."
