  "title": "\"Muscular Tension for Mental Strength: An Exercise Guide\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the benefits of progressive relaxation were discussed. Now, we explore how muscular tension can enhance mental strength, and how it is used to develop personal magnetism. The process of stiffening muscles can compress the jugular veins and increase cerebral congestion, leading to increased mental activity. Moreover, it can accumulate nerve force, which can be released during relaxation. This simple exercise can be beneficial for well-being and personal empowerment through the development of quantum coherence in the brain. The exercise includes sitting quietly and taking slow breaths until the lungs are fully inflated.",
  "content": "A first physiological interpretation is that this stiffening, by its effect upon the circulation, will also compress the jugular veins, will retard the return of blood from the brain and increase cerebral congestion and mental activity. The condition appears involuntarily when a man becomes enthusiastic, and in all magnetic speakers (think to how you behave when you are enthusiastic). It can be used at will by any man who wishes to increase his personal power and will aid much in the development of personal magnetism. Another interpretation is that this static stiffening will accumulate nerve force, that will then be released at a further moment of relaxing. Finally a quantum explanation would be of developing “quantum coherence” in the brain. Tensions to develop well being This simple exercise uses tension and press also the breath in the upper chest. 1st. In the morning sit down quietly facing the east. Rest your hands quietly on your knee, close the lips, and through the nostrils draw in the breath slowly until the lungs are well inflated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this simple exercise can help increase personal power, aid in the development of personal magnetism, accumulate nerve force, and develop quantum coherence in the brain. By practicing this exercise, tensions can be released and well-being can be achieved. So, start your day by sitting quietly and focusing on your breath while gradually increasing your muscle tension, and reap the benefits of this powerful exercise."
