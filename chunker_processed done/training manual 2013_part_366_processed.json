  "title": "\"Developing Subtle Presence through Breathing and Mirror Exercise\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about a breathing exercise that increases awareness of the body and subtle energies within. This last section delves into a more advanced exercise that involves using a mirror to develop a connection between the subject and the image. This technique can lead to a energetic state and new perspectives on reality. The exercise involves filling up your lungs while standing in front of a mirror and can be further enhanced by combining it with other breathing techniques. The text also highlights important concepts such as the albedo phase and the eagle's breathing.",
  "content": "When facing the mirror, we gradually start becoming present to our own selves . What then occurs at a second stage is a phenomenon of “multiplication”. At that point, one discovers that, bit by bit, he moves on numberless occasions from subject to object, whereupon a change of state occurs, which is a \"fermentation\" of something new.110 What one gets, indeed, is the development of a subtle interplay between the subject and the image. 111 One can feel an energy developing. The state might be facilitated even through the left eye alone, given that the “albedo” phase which we bring off through this kind of breathing is essentially lunar in nature, and as such related to the left side of the body. By the use of the mirror, we can even augment the energy at a later point, or appropriate certain symbols through the “eagle’s breathing”. Exercise 15 Combined breathing. While standing in front of a mirror, you should begin to gradually fill up your lungs.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing combined breathing in front of the mirror can create a subtle interplay between the subject and the image. Visualizing a symbol while gradually filling up your lungs and lifting your arms can increase energy and promote a state of fermentation, leading to the development of something new."
