  "title": "\"The Art of Hypnosis: Connecting with Inner Wisdom for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final portion of this text, the focus shifts towards the deep states of hypnosis, including mind-to-mind connections, mind-to-universe connections and healing by resonance. The author begins by speaking about the importance of being in touch with our inner core and natural wisdom for spontaneous healing. They then go on to explain the role of the operator in inducing hypnotic states and how deeper states of hypnosis depend on their participation and emotional involvement. The author also touches on the importance of relearning the human approach to hypnosis that was prevalent in the past, where hypnotists and magnetizers relied more on their personality and gaze to entangle with the subject. Finally, the author talks about analgesia and the use of anaesthesia as a test to determine when a person is in a deep hypnotic state.",
  "content": "In fact these states were very frequent in the past, when people had a more human approach, with countless numbers of interesting experiments conducted initially by hypnotizers and then by magnetizers. These results were due to the fact that the framework was different and hypnosis was seen as an art relying on the personality of the operator more than on a technology based on procedures. It was a time when people perfermed many vitalistic exercises and worked with the gaze in a way that made him quantistically “entangled” with the subject. These ancient hypnotists and magnetists realized many times what in a modern way would be called a healing by resonance. If we want to express it in quantistic terms, it is through entanglement and accessing the underlying interconnecting reality. Healing was a natural outcome of these states, but there were also many strange effects that ensued as a deeper and seemingly telepathic mind-to-mind connection and an unfolding mind-to-universe connection. Analgesia, hypnotic anesthesia and deep states In our analysis of these deep states, we will begin from an element which is very tangible: analgesia or anaesthesia. A person can in reality believe to be in a deep state, but analgesia constitutes a very useful test.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while hypnosis and magnetism were once seen as an art form, there is evidence of healing and deeper connections between the mind and the universe. Analgesia, or absence of pain, is a tangible test that links these deep states to hypnotic anesthesia. It is essential to recognize the potential of these ancient practices and explore the phenomena with a critical but open mind."
