  "title": "\"The Power of Mental Images and Visualization Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author delves into the impact of using mental images on health and behavior change. They emphasize the importance of observing images with reflected light and using light sources close to important symbols for transmutation. They also mention how positive visualization can act on health and share a personal anecdote about a collaborator experiencing the disappearance of a fibroid through visualization. The author cautions that this practice requires an increased level of awareness and emphasizes the importance of reconciling with one's subconscious. They conclude by suggesting additional exercises at the end of the book and encouraging readers to move onto the next stage for even greater effectiveness.",
  "content": "Several scientific studies support the validity of that practice. In addition, for example, my collaborator Susanna (mentioned previously) has experienced the disappearance of a fibroid she was already been scheduled for surgery for, simply imagining his disappearance every night before falling asleep. In the same way, you can change behaviours and inveterate habits. Beware, you will not get results only with techniqueâ€™s aid. What we are speaking of is an art, accessible only if we increase our level of awareness. Virtually, we must realize that what we call our subconscious it is us. Reconcile with him. Is our most primal and profound being that imagines, the root of our Id. However, at the end of this phase you can already perform the additional exercises at the end of the book. Nevertheless, if you want even greater effectiveness, you must pass to the next stage.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by increasing our level of awareness and reconciling with our subconscious, we can change our behaviors and even inveterate habits. While techniques and exercises can aid in this process, it is ultimately an art form that requires dedication and practice. By following the instructions and progressing through the stages outlined, we can reach a state of positive trance and become the masters of our own minds."
