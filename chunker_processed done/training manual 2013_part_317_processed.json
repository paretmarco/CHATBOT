  "title": "\"Reintegration: The Pathway to Consciousness and Creativity\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of \"reintegration\" as the key to unlocking the power of magnetism and energetic ascent of man. Before explaining that, the author discusses the idea of consciousness and how it affects one's ability to be truly present and achieve what they desire. The author cites Ouspensky's view that a person can experience objective consciousness through hypnosis, yet fail to remember it. The article argues that objective consciousness is a natural state of being, and that reintegration is necessary since our conditions are often abnormal. In the last 200 tokens, the author expands on the idea of reintegration and cites various philosophers and spiritual leaders who have discussed it, such as Gurdjieff and Rumi.",
  "content": "In actual fact, human freedom (the so-called free choice) exists, but is very much limited. Usually, man is essentially irresponsible so long as he is not conscious. The key to everything, to be able “to ride one’s own destiny”, is to be conscious. This entails consciousness of one’s being. There is a close link between the concept of objective consciousness and what happens to man as a result of certain techniques of hypnosis. As stated by Ouspensky: \"An ordinary man might be artificially led to a state of objective consciousness, and subsequently taken back to his usual being. He will, however, fail to remember anything, and will merely think that he has lost consciousness for a period of time.\" The state of objective consciousness represents a natural state: \"Such a state of consciousness is a natural right of man per se, and the fact that man might be divested of such right is only due to the fact that his conditions are abnormal.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving true human freedom and unlocking our natural state of objective consciousness requires a specific training and a deep understanding of oneself. Eliminating useless thoughts is the first essential step towards self-awareness and the ability to ride one’s own destiny. By pushing aside what clutters our minds, we can access the core of our being and experience a state of consciousness that is our natural right as human beings."
