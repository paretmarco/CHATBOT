  "title": "The State of the Sensorium: Understanding Sensory Perception and Memory.",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the sensorium, which is the part of the nervous system that receives impulses from the organs of sense. The author explains how consciousness may be transient and leave only a faint impression on memory, but vivid impressions may be revived afterwards. The last 200 tokens provide examples of how a patient in a hypnotic state may be able to recall sensory perceptions upon waking. The text highlights the importance of attention in memory formation. The relevant people and concepts in this section include the sensorium, consciousness, memory, attention, and hypnotic states.",
  "content": "Thus, suppose a person in the dark light is suddenly brought before the eye; this affects the retina, and through the changes in it the optic nerve and central organ, there may be consciousness or there may not; if the person be wide awake he will see the light; if he be asleep he will not see it, at all events he will give no indication of seeing it; on awaking, he may have a recollection of a dream in which light has a place, or his memory maybe blank; but nevertheless the light will cause the pupil of the eye to contract by reflex action without his consciousness; and perhaps, also without consciousness, the sleeping person may make an effort to avoid the light, as has been noticed in the case of somnambulists. Now, when a patient has been thrown into a weak hypnotic state, there may be a mind recollection on awaking of all that happened during the apparent sleep. This implies, of course, that conscious sensory perceptions took place during the condition. Memory depends on the direction of the attention to sensations. If the effort of attention be strong, the recollection will probably be vivid, and the converse is true.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, conscious sensory perceptions during weak hypnotic states can lead to vivid recollections upon awakening, depending on the strength of attention. However, in deeper hypnotism, recollection may require hints and prompting questions, indicating that sensory perceptions may exist without leaving a lasting impression. The complexity of the brain and the interdependence of various neural structures remain a mystery to physiologists."
