  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, different personality types were discussed and how they can be mesmerized using different methods. In this last part, the focus is on exercises to develop the \"Fascinative Force,\" which is compared to muscle strength. The author emphasizes the importance of possessing this force and how it can help individuals lead a more fulfilling life. The text also debunks the belief that people who are more accustomed to obey are easier to fascinate. To become a magnetizing force, one needs to develop their fascinative force, and the author provides practical exercises to achieve this goal.",
  "content": "This type is very martial/circle and sublimating. His phsiology is dominated by the fire principle. “Nervous” type. Altruist/Adapter: time of this type is taken in passive absorbation. Sometimes he doesn’t develop some aspects of reasoning. He partners therefore with Will or Reasoner partners This type is easily mesmerized with the hands but the best is to fascinate him with the gaze This type will be very venusian, neither sublimating neither martial, his physiology lacks fiery aspects Exercises to develop the \"Fascinative Force\" The fascinative force is one of the best properties you can possess. Without it, we lead a tasteless existence without taking from life what is rightfully ours. We could compare it to muscle strength. Two people may do the same action but one is stronger than the other is, hence he wins while the other loses. In addition, here we would like to correct a false belief: generally, people who are more accustomed to obey are by tradition considered even more easily being fascinated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing the fascinative force is a crucial aspect of personal growth that can benefit everyone, regardless of their personality type. By focusing on cultivating the power and magnetism of our gaze, we can tap into our full potential and enjoy a more fulfilling life. Remember, the fascinative force is like a muscle that can be strengthened with practice and intention, so start exercising it today and witness the positive changes in your life."
