  "title": "\"The Fixation Strategy of Seven Observer/Personality Dyad\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the focus is on the fixation strategy of Observer/Personality dyad #7, called the Epicure. It involves a deep sense of emptiness, leading to obsession with food, sex or drugs to fill the void. Sevens may overcompensate with excessive planning or falsely identifying with an image of abundance or worth. This fixation can cause feelings of pride to cover up worthlessness, and ultimately lead to a distorted self-image. The author emphasizes the need for self-awareness, quoting Fritz Perls, M.D., that maturity is the transcendence to self-support.",
  "content": "This fixation style of the observer/personality dyad is called the LLII Epicure by Palmer, the Generalist by Riso, and iter 1.1.1 Opportunistic Idealism by Naranjo. Gluttony od is the way the personality attempts via food, sex, or drugs to fill the empty space. Sevens Pimcan also try to fill the emptiness by intellec- t') tual study or an over-spiritualization. The important concept here is over and exaggerated which often manifests as obsessive planning. This strategy of fixating attention gets extremely prideful to cover up the deep feelings of worthlessness. Sevens will sometimes overcompensate either with a false sense of spirituality or a false sense of abundance. So distant does the #7 get from the deep-rooted feeling of emptiness that they actually start be- r 226 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS lieving that they are their image. Consequently, there is a created fusion with the image of over-abundance and worth. Sevens might become gluttons, acquiring \"things,\" trying to fill the emptiness. This fixation believes their false image of abundance. Sevens also can, like fixation strategy #2, become very grandiose about their skills and abilities in an attempt to fill their emptiness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the fixation strategy of the LLII Epicure, Opportunistic Idealism, or Generalist is characterized by a desperate attempt to fill up the deep-rooted feelings of emptiness. Sevens may resort to gluttony or overcompensate with a false sense of abundance and grandiosity, leading to a fusion with their image and confusion between reality and imagination. However, understanding this behavior can help Sevens overcome their fears and achieve a sense of true fulfillment."
