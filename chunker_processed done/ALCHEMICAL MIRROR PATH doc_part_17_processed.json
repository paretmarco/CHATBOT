  "first_phrase": "This text depicts the author's journey in exploring the different states of consciousness beyond duality and into the abyss, where the hero must overcome the fear of insanity to cross it. The fourth and final stage, \"Beyond the abyss,\" is described as a feeling of physical reality diminishing until it disappears completely, leading to a greater clarity of concepts. The author suggests that the dissolved body can move in any direction toward infinity. The text concludes with the realization that it is impossible to perfectly convey these experiences with words alone.",
  "content": "FOURTH STAGE - Beyond the abyss \"The vague intuition of this mystery will eventually go beyond first attitude of bewilderment, and once again consciousness will find itself on the verge of a new abyss the only abyss, perhaps, that in its infinite extension presents thousands of different aspects, frighteningly deep from whichever side you try to cross it. And these abysmal feelings are often multifaceted and daring, the hero wanting to cross it must overcome all fear of insanity. But how to cross the abyss? Identifying with it. The perfect calm comes from the more intense vertigo and it is precisely pushing it to the extreme that, at some moment, you feel the dark abyss opening beneath the feet, and you fall there, until, having acquired full ownership of self and self-focusing on thought, you will note that the feeling of physical reality, body, will gradually diminishing until it disappears almost completely. A greater clarity of concepts will appear. It seems then that the body that has dissolved in a fluidic consistency, while remaining intact in a equal density (the so called alchemical \"mare nostrum\" or \"aqua regia\"), could easily move, traveling in all directions, toward infinity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by identifying with the abyss and pushing our fears to the limit, we can overcome our limitations and connect with cosmic consciousness. The exercises outlined in the first and second chambers provide a practical path towards this goal, helping us to shed our crust and reach deeper states of being. With dedication and patience, we can climb the highest steps of initiation and unlock the mysteries of our existence."
