  "title": "\"Mesmerism and Hypnotism: Understanding the Differences\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the article explored the essential similarities and differences between Hypnotism and Mesmerism. The author also discussed how subjects react to both. The last 200 tokens introduce Heidenhain's connection of skin to nervous system and how it can cause hypnosis. The text explains how changes in stimulus, whether by sudden fright or determined suggestion, affects the hypnotic state. The Editor notes two types of hypnotism: “Physiological Hypnotism” and fascination. The article concludes with a quote from Dr. who provided insight into the beneficial aspect of hypnotic and magnetic processes.",
  "content": "In the mesmeric, the sleep is calm, refreshing, and curative; the pulse slow and rhythmic; in the hypnotic state the respiration is frequently irregular, accompanied by slight convulsive movements, nausea and vomiting, and general prostration of the nervous system. Hypnotism is, of course, modified by the temperament, character, and health of the subject; so is Mesmerism,for that matter, but the foregoing out of many observed instances serve to point out the essential difference between the two states. The Hypnotism of Charcot, Mm. Bourru, Butot, Voisin, and others—Heidenhain, for that matter,—are but modifications of the discovery of Br. Braid. “I do not pretend to say that it (Mesmerism) can never do harm, but I can say that in all cases which I have seen treated myself, of which a great number occurred in nervous individuals affected with various diseases—even with diseases of heart which would appear most liable to suffer from all extraordinary excitation—the effect of magnetic process in general and of sleep in particular has always been calming, and in no instance has it been disagreeable to the patient; it acted, moreover, in a beneficial manner upon their health.”—Dr.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while both Mesmerism and Hypnotism have their differences and potential benefits, the former seems to have a more calming and positive effect on patients, whereas the latter can induce more negative side effects. It is important to exercise caution and expertise when practicing either of these techniques."
