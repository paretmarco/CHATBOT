  "title": "\"The Sybil's Mission: Understanding the Occult Causes of Life\"",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the concept of directing the lifeblood only to productive branches, governance of sap, and the principle of selection in life. The Sybil, the priestess of the Temple of Saturn, understands the occult causes that reveal the fundamental unity of things. Her musical sensibility to perceive subtle harmony is key to divination. Egoism, love of riches, and thirst for honor paralyze our lucidity, and preventing spiritual vision. The text culminates with a discussion on the Elements and how modern chemistry has confused the ancient Quaternary of elements.",
  "content": "To make ourselves more sensible we must be disinterested, like the Sybil, indifferent to the gold coins that fall at her feet; we must know how to rid ourselves of our metals, like the masonic ritual demands. Egoism, the love of riches and the thirst for honour paralyse our lucidity and stand like a folding screen to block our spiritual vision. It is the symbolic blindfold over the eyes of the ignorant one who has failed to conquer the light. The two tritons playing the trumpet on the domed roof of the temple of Saturn spurred our colleague on to an extensive discourse on the Elements, understood as the Four Winds of the Spirit. On that topic, the modifications that have been made to the ancient masonic rituals are deplorable beyond belief. All that they did not understand has been lost, our commentator claims, and – even more disastrous – so has that which they believed they did understand. Having persistently confused the Elements of the ancients with the simple bodies of modern chemistry, they were unable to hark back to the notion of the Quaternary of elements, the agent that works to differentiate the primordial substance, which is essentially singular.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to attain spiritual vision and overcome our animality, we must rid ourselves of egoism and materialistic desires. Understanding the Elements as the Four Winds of the Spirit can help us differentiate the primordial substance and pass from sensual life to spiritual life. Let us seek knowledge and disinterest, like the Sybil, to conquer the light and become fully Man."
