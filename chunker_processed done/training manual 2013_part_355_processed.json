  "title": "\"Understanding the Concept of Time and Reaching Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we have discussed how time is a mental construct that can expand, contract, or even stop under certain circumstances. However, reaching the essence of time is a long journey that requires the actualization of certain practices. One such method is the technique of \"progressive relaxation,\" where one relaxes their entire body gradually. Another method is to concentrate on the navel, a practice used by the monks of Mount Athos. Finally, the \"magnetic massage\" is a powerful method that can be used with a guide or autonomously. Exercise 13 will delve deeper into the \"magnetic massage\" method.",
  "content": "A suitable method is, for instance, the technique of “progressive relaxation”: Exercise 12: General relaxation As we lie down, we relax our whole body, starting with the feet and later climbing back step by step until we reach the head. The exercise must necessarily last approximately ten minutes and be carried out with maximum presence to our bodily sensations 104. Finally, an additional method consists in concentrating on the navel. It is a method that is practiced by inter alia the monks of Mount Athos. This method can be utilized either with a guide, which is the ideal for those persons who are still beginning to approach the understanding of these methodologies, as is the case with the under-mentioned exercise of the “magnetic massage”, or else on your own, autonomously. And finally very strong could be the “magnetic massage”. Exercise 13: Magnetic Massage.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these relaxation techniques can be very beneficial for reducing stress and anxiety in daily life. The progressive relaxation exercise and concentration on the navel or magnetic massage methods can help to enhance receptivity to magnetism and can serve as a step towards reconnecting with one's inner self. It is important to practice them with maximum presence to our bodily sensations and find the right method that works best for us."
