  "title": "\"The Separation of Sensory Impressions and Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between sensory impressions and conscious awareness, as well as the process by which conscious efforts can become habitual and performed without awareness. In the last 200 tokens, the author provides an example of a man in deep thought who is still able to navigate his surroundings without conscious effort. This phenomenon is explained through the idea that initially conscious processes can become automatic with repetition.",
  "content": "Thus a child learns to perform a piece of music on the pianoforte by conscious efforts, often of a painful kind; each note has to be recognised and the appropriate muscular movements required for its production on the instrument executed with precision and delicacy; but by and by the music may be performed accurately even while the attention is directed to something else. In like manner, all movements which are the results of sensory impressions may become unconscious movements; the sensory impressions are at first paid attention to; but as they become habitual the mind becomes less and less engaged in the process, until the movements resulting from them are practically unconscious. A familiar illustration is that of a man in deep reverie, walking along a street. Immersed in thought, he pays little or no attention to passers by; as his eyes are open, their images, or those of adjacent objects, must affect his visual apparatus, but they arouse no conscious impression and still those impressions evanescent as they are sufficient to excite the appropriate movements of locomotion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the human nervous system is capable of producing movements that are essentially voluntary even without the involvement of volition. The repeated sensory impressions, over time, become habitual and so ingrained that they require little or no conscious effort, leaving the mind free to attend to other things. This phenomenon is the result of the machinery of the nervous system and highlights the incredible adaptability and plasticity of the human brain."
