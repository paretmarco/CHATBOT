  "title": "Donato: The Revolutionary Magnetizer of the 19th Century",
  "first_phrase": "This section highlights how Donato (Alfred d'Hont) revolutionized hypnotic practice through his rediscovery of \"fascination.\" Donato's uncommon physical strength, quick and insistent eyes, and much spirit helped him to achieve much more astonishing results than his predecessors. He experimented with about thirty young men, one by one, using a technique where he quickly and brusquely looked at them from very close, turned them around, and continued to fix them with his gaze, thereby gaining their fascination. This technique was a lot more effective compared to the slow and laborious methods previously used.",
  "content": "He had the good fortune of soon making some discoveries which, to an extent, enabled him to convincing the world not only of the reality of somnambulism, but also, above all, of other much more astonishing phenomena as well. Most of his predecessors resorted to interminable movements of the hands in front of their subjects, or else they forced them to state at the blade of a knife for twenty minutes before they could attain any appreciable result. We can see instead, in the account of an eyewitness quoted in L'Italia (1886), how Donato worked: â€œDonato looks at the young man quickly, brusquely, and from very close; the operator then turns the subject round and continues to fix him and provoke him with his glance; the latter, as though attracted and fascinated, follows him with wide open eyes. He experiments with about thirty young men, one by one [. . .]",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Donato's unique approach to the study of somnambulism and other paranormal phenomena shed new light on these experiences. By eschewing the usual methods and relying on his own hypnotic gaze, he was able to provoke powerful reactions in his subjects, providing compelling evidence of the reality of these phenomena."
