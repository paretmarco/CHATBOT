  "title": "The Importance of Boundaries in Defining Our Existence",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section, the author delves into the concept of undifferentiated space, the importance of defining boundaries, and the relationship between chaos and disappearance. Exploring how creating boundaries helps us define ourselves as separate entities, the text cites examples from physics and everyday life to support its claims. The Tao of Chaos exercise #7 is also introduced. In this exercise, readers are asked to experience their skin as a solid, highlighting the importance of examining one's imaginary boundary to feel connected to everything.",
  "content": "Physics suggests that there is an underlying order, however, where order emerges. \"Systems return to the same peculiar pattern of irregularity as before. It is locally unpredictable globally stable.\" (Chaos, James Gleick, p. 48) Therefore, moving a thought or experience from one phase of space to a different phase of space shows us the underlying order. Disappearance and Chaos We disappear if there are no boundaries. Because without making undifferentiated space into boundaried space we do not exist as separate individuals. Simply put, everything without definitions or boundaries runs into or interpenetrates everything else. For example, imagine a glass jar. Notice there is a space inside the jar and a space outside the jar. If we break the jar (boundaries), the space runs into itself and there is no longer an inside space (called you) and an outside space (called outside). What, then, are these boundaries of the glass? Condensed space. Therefore, in order to feel \"connected\" to everything, we must first examine our imaginary boundary and, second, experience non-boundaried existence. Tao of Chaos Exercise #7 Eyes Closed Step I Experience your skin as a solid.",
  "last_phrase": "By understanding the concept of boundaries and non-boundaried existence, we can explore the underlying order that physics suggests through Chaos theory. Examining our imaginary boundaries can help us feel connected to everything and lead us to the realization that, ultimately, we are all made up of the same substance - space. Through the Tao of Chaos Exercise #7, we can take steps towards experiencing this interconnectedness and opening the doorway to self-reflection."
