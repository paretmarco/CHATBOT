  "title": "What are the essential steps to perform successful magical experiments?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author provides instructions for performing a magical experiment. The author advises the reader to be calm, prompt and well-prepared for accidents. They should also keep the subjects away from strangers and hide the magical sign if necessary. The text emphasizes the importance of physical and spiritual readiness for the experiment to be successful. It's an intriguing guide for conducting a magical experiment that involves one creating a magical sign with a particular quality to it.",
  "content": "Prepare yourself only for numerous eventualities or accidents, of which several will be formidable. Be quick and prompt in the determinations you will have to take, for the emotions of the Subjects cause their sensibilities to overflow; and it is necessary that you should arrive in time, seize and transport them a good distance away from the Magical sign. Keep them as much as possible from the contact of strangers, and preserve yourself within yourself. Let there be around you sufficient space to move freely, as also the Subject, who will describe circular motions around this sign. Have also an opaque cover to hide the sign instantaneously, in case of need; for often the emotions are so great, the frights so terrible, that if you do not conceal from sight the place where the images appear it will be next to impossible for you to keep your control over the Subject. Be yourself not moved, for you would become unable to calm the nervous disorder. Think that you do not yet know the resistance that the organs can offer to the vital forces, which, under these circumstances, appear increased fivefold.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, in dealing with the unpredictable nature of magical experiments or any unforeseen circumstances, it is important to remain calm, quick, and decisive. Keep a safe distance and protect yourself and others from harm. Remember, the power of the mind is vast and can lead to unexpected results, whether performed with or without traditional methods or tools."
