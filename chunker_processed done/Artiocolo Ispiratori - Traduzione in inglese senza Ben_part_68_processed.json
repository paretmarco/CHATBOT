  "title": "Campanelli's Method for Self-Improvement Simplified",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we encountered Prof. Dr. Michele Piccione's opinion about the \"elusive\" nature of Advocate Vincenzo Campanelli's healing interventions. However, Campanelli's method can be simplified, as we will see in this last part. The process involves standing in front of a mirror, formulating a resolution, and massaging the nape of your neck, among other steps. Finally, it involves touching your forehead and heart simultaneously and applying a gentle pressure on the sternum. This simplified technique will help you gain a deeper understanding of yourself or even help a friend.",
  "content": "PHASE 1: If you want to act on yourself, you should first decide what you would like to do (e.g. quitting smoking, or even giving up some other negative habit), and then proceed to stand in front of a mirror. As the first step, think of the habit you want to shelve aside, and follow that by formulating your resolution to put an end to it. At that stage, intensely look at yourselves straight in your eyes, relinquishing in the process every thought or word. PHASE 2: Sit down, close your eyes, rub your hands strongly, and touch the nape of your neck. Massage it with sufficient intensity, while you think of feeling well (You should massage the bone in such a way as to feel the light persistence of a sensation). PHASE 3: Touch your forehead and heart simultaneously, and apply a gentle pressure on the sternum (These are two important points which we hereby put in contact with one another).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking control of your habits and focusing on self-improvement can be a transformative experience. By following these simple steps, you can work towards shedding negative habits and promoting overall health and wellbeing. Remember to commit to making positive changes and take the time to care for both your mind and body."
