  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the text, we delve deeper into the symptoms of the hypnotic state. The author notes that certain people are more susceptible to hypnosis than others, and the phenomenon has been likened to animal magnetism and odylic influences. The author goes on to explain that the symptoms of hypnosis can be grouped into four categories based on their effects on the nervous system. It is noted that most of these phenomena have physiological explanations, and until we gain further insight into the physiology of the nervous system, some of them may remain unexplained. The text provides valuable information on hypnosis, its effects, and its potential for explanation.",
  "content": "Many operators have no doubt believed they possessed such a force such a belief would not affect the success of their experiments except to make them likely to be successful, as the operator would readily comply with all the conditions; but most of these phenomena can be explained physiologically, and those which cannot be so accounted for will remain hidden until we get further light on the physiology of the nervous system. The symptoms of the hypnotic state, as shown by Heidenhain, may be grouped under four heads:— (1) Those referable to conditions of the “sensorium” or portions of the brain which receives nervous impulses, resulting in movements of a reflex and imitative-character; (2) Insensibility to pain, and various forms of perverted sensation; (3), Increased irritability of the portion of the nervous system devoted to reflex-actions; and (4) States of file nervous centres controlling the movements of the eye, and accommodation of the eye to objects at various distances, and the movement of respiration, etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while some may have believed in a mysterious force driving hypnotic phenomena, most of these can be explained by physiology. The hypnotic state involves four categories of symptoms, including imitative reflexes, insensitivity to pain, increased reflexivity, and alterations in eye movements and respiration. Ultimately, the sensorium plays a critical role in receiving sensory information and creating reflexive motions, which may be conscious or unconscious."
