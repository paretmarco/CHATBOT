  "title": "Who was Lafontaine and what were his cures and beliefs about magnetic healing?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, we learn about Lafontaine's success in treating various illnesses using magnetism, including a remarkable case where a patient considered terminally ill by physicians was healed. We also see how Lafontaine was both revered and reviled by societal elites who experienced his methods. Additionally, we get a glimpse of Lafontaine's open-minded and generous nature through his interactions with a group of Native Americans who taught him about their healing methods, and his willingness to help them financially when they were in need. Throughout, we see how Lafontaine's mindset and belief in the nervous fluid as the main agent of healing drove his theory of magnetism.",
  "content": "Openess of mind and generosity of Lafontaine Lafontaine once met a group of Native Americans who were thattravelling to Paris at that time and showed them his way of healing. They found it very interesting. He became friends with them and they told him that they had sent him the plants that they used for healing purposes. After they left they sent him a letter: Kind Friend, You have been a brother to us while we were in Paris, and we hope the Great Spirit will let you enjoy many bright and happy days. This is the sincere wish of your friend, Manguados \"A chippeway chief of North America\" 134 As they travelled throughout Europe they arrived in Brussels and found they had no more money. When he came to know about this Lafontaine organised a subscription for them at one of his evenings and sent them the money to go back to America. Lafontaine’s mindset and the belief in the \"fluid\" The theory of Lafontaine is very simple: the nervous fluid is the main agent, even more than the will. The Will for Lafontaine is “the concentration of the mind on one thing”. The fluid for him is an internal and universal element.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Lafontaine's openness of mind and generosity made him not only a great healer but also a true friend to people from different cultures. His belief in the existence of a fluid greatly influenced his powerful method, leading to some interesting experiments. Remember to keep an open mind and believe in the power of your thoughts and actions to achieve results."
