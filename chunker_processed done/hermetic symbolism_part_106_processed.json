  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the text explores the idea of maintaining individual life by preserving vital fluid and the art of growing old yet postponing decrepitude. It emphasizes the importance of moral hygiene and how it can preserve a person. The text also introduces the concept of \"magnetists' fluid,\" which refers to the vital water that can be used to re-establish normal conditions in an ill person's aura. Moreover, it suggests that a preternatural blaze can be transmitted by working directly on the fire of another person.",
  "content": "He dedicates himself, therefore, to guiding and directing his physical life, but without attributing to it more importance than it deserves. In order to save his vital fluid, he avoids spending it excessively or in a superfluous manner; that is, avoiding any excess. However, there is also an art of growing old yet postponing decrepitude, of staying young in spite of one’s years. The fountain of Youth resides in the ethereal part of Salt , in the heavenly part of our self. If we keep ourselves young in soul and in spirit, if we bend ourselves to the service of good work, if we love, if we think about others and forget about ourselves, we will not become hard: our moral hygiene will ensure that we are preserved. The magnetists’ fluid That which the magnetizer calls “fluid” is the vital Water that is externalised in the form of vapour. When an ill person’s aura is very dry, the healer can offer their water to re-establish normal conditions and the resulting new vitality will help the patient.29 On the other hand, it is possible to work directly on the Fire of another person, by transmitting a preternatural blaze.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by taking care of our physical, spiritual, and moral hygiene, we can delay the aging process and preserve our vitality for a longer time. We can also benefit from the magnetist's fluid and work on transmitting positive energies to others, without losing our individuality and independence. Ultimately, it is through self-improvement and helping others that we can achieve a meaningful and fulfilling life."
