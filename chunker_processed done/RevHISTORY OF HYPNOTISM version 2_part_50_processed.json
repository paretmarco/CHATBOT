According to Paracelsus, there was a vital energy, an “arcanum” in the universe. .‘as a man imagines himself to be so he is’( Paracelsus) Paracelsus – Physician, Alchemist and Healer In coagulating itself, this universal energy creates the world and everything contained in it. The world is in some way a living one. Even if this point of view may seem strange to modern man, it is this way by many people who live in contact with the Nature. Modern science can give a sense to these concepts through the idea of consciousness. In quantistic science, the observer in some way creates his own reality. Even in plain psychology, we do not perceive the world directly, but we see only the image we create in our brain of it, interpreting, as Jung said, a world of vibrations.",
