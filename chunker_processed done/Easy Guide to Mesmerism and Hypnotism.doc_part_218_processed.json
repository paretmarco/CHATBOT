  "title": "\"Leading Your Subjects Through an Imaginary Garden\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this piece, the author describes leading individuals into an imaginary garden and observing how they react to its beauty and fruit. However, a disturbance occurs when one person disturbs a cluster of bees. The author then steers the group towards a cemetery, where they reflect on past experiences and lost loved ones. In this final 200-token portion, the author highlights the power of suggestion in this state of dreaming, recounting numerous instances where individuals have given up harmful habits by making promises in this state.",
  "content": "In all this, you give the natural faculties of each their action as in dream. Again find a little grave, read the pathetic story which the epitaph unfolds, and by gradual transition lead your whole party into a cemetery or necropolis (as in dreaming, your subject will pass from one stage to another without question). Here, again, you let the faculties have full play. One will sit and reflect on boyhood's days, and the companionship of friends now gone; another will plant a rose bush by the grave of a friend—a little brother or child; a thoughtless youth will shed abundant tears, real tears, by the grave of his mother —upon being judiciously questioned, will perhaps admit that “he has been rather thoughtless and wayward” “has not been living just as his mother would like him to do, and now he is truly sorry for it, and may promise amendment”. (I have succeeded in getting many subjects to give up tobacco and drink, and forego other habits by promises give me in this state, which they afterwards faithfully adhered to in their waking state).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, creating a dream-like experience in a cemetery or necropolis can have a powerful emotional impact on individuals, leading to introspection and potential behavior changes. By allowing our natural faculties to have full play, we can experience a range of emotions and expressions, from reflection and tears to dance and joy. The power of suggestion and imagination can lead to remarkable results and a memorable, applause-worthy experience."
