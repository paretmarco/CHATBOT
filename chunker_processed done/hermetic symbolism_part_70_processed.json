  "title": "\"The Power of Symbols in Philosophical Thinking\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author discusses the limitations of precise formulae in comparison to symbols that allow for complex and mobile thought. This section explores the significance of symbols and their role in revealing mysteries and promoting independent thinking. The author notes that symbols cannot be used to express scientific truths, but rather they allow individuals to delve into the mysteries of life that surround us. The text emphasizes the importance of arcane knowledge and the necessity of seeking knowledge through meditation rather than from external sources. The author also notes that the basic symbols of Hermeticism can be interpreted to help orientate one's spirit.",
  "content": "And it can be no other way, if one wants to delve into the mysteries of life – these truths surrounded by darkness, which are far too easily transformed into monstrous mistakes when one tries to express them in any other language but that of symbolic allegories. This is the justification for the silence imposed on the initiates. The arcane mysteries, effectively, can only be conceived of by a supreme effort of intelligence: they make the spirit of the truly Enlightened one glow brighter, internally, but they could not serve as the subject of a professor’s dissertations. Occult knowledge cannot be transferred by speech nor by the written word. It can only be conquered in meditation, and whomsoever searches for it outside himself is on the wrong path. This is how we are meant to interpret Socrates’ . * * * These considerations will no doubt help to clarify things. By interpreting the basic symbols of Hermeticism in the manner we felt to be most reasonable, we were simply seeking to orientate our spirits, by demonstrating how a series of geometric shapes can be made to speak.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is clear that the mysteries of life cannot be fully expressed through language alone, and that occult knowledge can only be understood through internal meditation. While we have only scratched the surface of Hermeticism's symbolism, it is up to each individual to construct their own logical interpretations. Let us continue to explore and seek understanding, but always remember that true enlightenment comes from within."
