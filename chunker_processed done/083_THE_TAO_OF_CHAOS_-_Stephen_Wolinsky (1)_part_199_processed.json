  "title": "\"Fixation of Attention: Defense Mechanism Against Trauma\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the concept of Fixations of Attention and how they occur as strategies to avoid trauma. The observer resists facing the emptiness of Essence by fixating its attention on a particular feeling or I-dentity. Changing the personality is not the solution, as it adds to the defense mechanism of trauma. The observer must turn its attention towards the emptiness to reach Essence, rather than looking for a better personality. The chapter also discusses Advanced Attention Training and the fixation of attention known as angry virtue, perfectionist or the reformer. The underlying state of consciousness is crucial in understanding how Fixations of Attention work.",
  "content": "To turn the attention of the observer/personality's fixation of attention outward to a \"better personality\" leads to more I-dentities and more personality and hence away from Essence. Fixations of Attention are Strategies Fixations of attention, like trance states, occur when the observer of an experience shrinks their focus of attention and ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 157 goes into a trance-like state by fusing with a particular state or I-dentity to avoid the trauma of loss of being. Chapter 23 is called Advanced Attention Training which discusses the observer's attention and how it organizes inward as well as outward attention. I'M O.K. IF I'M PERFECT YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU'RE PERFECT T he first fixation has different names. Naranjo calls it angry virtue, it is called the perfectionist by Palmer, and the re- former by Riso. This fixation of attention is marked by a deep resentment and characterologically the body is rigid, and looks brittle as if it might break. The Underlying State The underlying state of consciousness of each fixation of attention is critical in understanding how Essence is organized around the observer/personality dyad. The underlying state is that chronic underlying condition which might be a feeling, a thought or a state of consciousness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by recognizing and understanding our fixations of attention and the underlying states that reinforce them, we can begin to shift our focus outward and away from these limiting identities. Through advanced attention training, we can learn to organize both our inward and outward attention towards a more expansive and authentic expression of our true selves."
