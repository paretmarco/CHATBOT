  "title": "\"The Power of Positive Fascination: Overcoming Fear and Anxiety\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the “embedding” of significant events in the body and how muscular tensions can correspond to mental tension. The following paragraphs focus on a study that induced fear in volunteers by showing them coloured squares and associating them with a light electrical shock. The fear was then extinguished by repeatedly showing the squares without the shock. The researchers found that fear only disappears if the fear-erasing training is conducted within a short period of time from the reintroduction of the scary stimulus. This section highlights the work of the researchers and the importance of timing in the treatment of fear.",
  "content": "During the subsequent day, fear was recalled to any such patient’s mind by showing him the coloured squares once more. Thereafter, within the space of a few hours from the creation of the said stimulus, the researchers showed them the squares quite a number of times, but now without accompanying them by the electrical shock. At the end of this training, fear is removed. The disappearance of the symptom only takes place if the action which is engaged in so as to extirpate it takes place within a short period from the moment when the patient is presented again with the scary symptom; if such symptom is not reintroduced, or if the ‘fear-erasing’ training is conducted many hours later, the volunteering patients retain a trace of the fear. Put it in other words, they retain their fear of having to see the squares again.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the study shows that fear can be removed through a short-term retraining process, but if the stimulus is not reintroduced promptly, the fear may linger. Additionally, the therapy of the look, which involves positive fascination, can help eliminate negative fascination from life experiences. Ultimately, our innate fears and anxieties drive us to develop coping mechanisms to overcome the unknown."
