  "content": "For example: From the ancient hermetists and alchemists we can learn the wholistic relationship with Nature. From Mesmer’s teaching we can learn the importance of the body and the theory of illness, as well as the interconnectedness of man with everything. From de Lausanne we can learn the importance of sensitivity From de Puysegur the power touch charged with will From du Potet the higher types of magnetism From Lafontaine the importance of Concentration Etc… History of Animal magnetism The more attention we pay to modem writers on hypnotism, the more those of us who are also familiar with the earlier writers will be struck by the fact that above all their other characteristics the modem hypnotists from Braid downwards are not those who have put the investigation of mesmeric phenomena on a scientific basis. (Sinnet – The rationale of mesmerism) The practice of animal magnetism dates from a very early period, not only with regard to the cure of diseases, but also in order to serve other important purposes; and the more general diffusion of a knowledge of the higher order of phenomena connected with it will doubtless go far to elucidate several occurrences handed down to us by tradition that have been heretofore enveloped in mystery.",
