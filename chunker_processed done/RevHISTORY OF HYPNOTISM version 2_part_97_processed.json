  "content": "Modern hypnotherapy and psychology are too often focused solely on the mind, although scientific researches have given abundant proof of the significant role played by the body. It is precisely for this reason, to clarify the extent of significance that such an ‘enteric brain’ possesses, that I penned my book titled “Awakening your other brain”. This brain is called enteric because it is here that many of the elements that are peculiar to the brain, beginning with the neurotransmitters, are produced and utilized. There is, therefore, a preferential channel linking stomach and head, one that ensures our actions, both instinctive and rational, are always endowed with a deep visceral component. The brain is not the only regulatory tool, as all the other physiological processes in turn regulate it . By having recourse to magnetic methodology, we are accordingly given the chance to act on these and other similar types of internal variables, and to ‘speak to the body’ even though no word is being used. In such a way, we can lend assistance to a large number of reactions by the immune system.",
