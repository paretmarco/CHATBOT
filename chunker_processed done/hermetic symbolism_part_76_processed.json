  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the importance of shedding one's narrow personality and identifying with the enduring aspects of humanity was emphasized. This idea is connected to the concept of Occult Medicine, which is based on the secret laws that govern nature and were analyzed by intuitive sages in ancient times. The last 200 tokens discuss some of the important symbols used in Occult Medicine, such as the point at the center of a circle and the alchemist's signs for the two columns of personality. The text also includes a table of important elements and an explanation of the tetraktys, a symbol used in Pythagorean philosophy.",

This medicine employs means that seem irrational to those who are not initiated in the secret laws that govern nature. These laws were analysed, insofar as their practical application goes, by the intuitive sages of our most ancient history. Later on they gave inspiration to the traditional science, known by the name of Magic. This is, indeed, a serious knowledge, profound, arduous, difficult to assimilate, even if only in theory: carrying it out in practice is even more formidable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Occult Medicine is an intricate labyrinth that requires appropriate preparation and a valiant spirit to undertake the journey. It involves understanding the invisible and inexplicable aspects of mankind, governed by secret laws of nature, and employing means that may seem irrational to the uninitiated. Although formidable, the Initiation is possible for those who fulfill the conditions of an intellectual, moral, and physical nature and are willing to endure arduous tests."
