  "content": "It has been shown that these are connected, by insensible gradations, with the lower or more usual phenomena, and that, as both classes of facts depend, so far as we know, on the same cause, and both are equally inexplicable on ordinary principles, or rather equally explicable, the one class cannot, with strict propriety, be called higher or lower\" than the other. â€œNevertheless, as the effects of Sympathy and Clairvoyance have a peculiar character, which would partake of the supernatural, were we not convinced that they depend on natural causes, and have nothing miraculous about them, it may be convenient to use the term Higher Phenomena, on the understanding that this does not imply a difference in nature, but only in degree, for those to which we now proceed, in contradistinction to those already treated of, and first, of Sympathy. This power, as we have seen, begins to appear in the earlier stages, and is shown in the form of an attraction towards the magnetizer, or in that of obedience to his silent will.",
