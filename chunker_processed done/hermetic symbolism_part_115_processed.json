  "title": "\"The Septenary Structure of the Human Self\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author talked about the Great Work, the Philosophers' Stone, the Triangle of Solomon, and the importance of love in creating the Stone. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of individuals to renounce themselves for the universal Great Work. The strongest force comes from an individual's sentiment to take on all virtues, divine and lowly, and renounce their self. The Rosacrucians believed that love, like a pelican feeding its offspring with its own blood, is essential. It is only through complete and absolute love that one can create anything worthwhile.",
  "content": "But selfish desire would be useless: this love must be complete, absolute, it must be ready to give all of itself, with no reservations. The self, once illuminated by the Shining Star, glitters brightly and has the sign of the Pentagram, the emblem of ulterior power that can be unfurled according to the will of the adept. But the most dazzling of Magicians is nothing more than a simple witch doctor next to the Saint who forgets his self entirely and acts only in accordance with the divine will. The work of the former is his work and, however admirable it may be, it is still individual. The second may give the impression of not creating anything at all when in reality he is dedicated to the realisation of the universal Great Work. The strongest Force of all forces comes from the sentiment that causes the individual to renounce his own self in order to take into himself the whole Energy, the fusion of all divine and lowly virtues. The Rosacrucians believed that the Pelican, which feeds its offspring with its own blood, demonstrates that love without which the wisest of wise would be nothing more than a blasting horn or a clashing cymbal.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve the universal Great Work, we must renounce our own desires and act in accordance with the divine will, for the strongest force comes from the sentiment of love which feeds our whole being. Balancing the Spirit, Soul, and Body within ourselves is crucial for our health and normal function. The septenary structure of the human self is a reminder of this delicate balance that we should strive to achieve."
