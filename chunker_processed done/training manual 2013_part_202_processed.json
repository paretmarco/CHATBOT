  "title": "\"The Art of Mental Fascination for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the benefits of fascination and its history as a healing technique. The author mentions Prof. Erminio, who used his astrological studies to achieve balance with the universal harmony and taught others to employ this art for healing purposes. The author also reveals that Prof. Caravelli was an expert in the art of \"bi-location\" and had introduced them to the ancient and beneficial technique of using the look to exercise a powerful influence. The last 200 tokens describe how this technique had remained hidden and only a few people, such as William Atkinson and Seligmann, had written about it without being initiated to the technique themselves.",
  "content": "These keys had remained hidden up to now. Indeed, although, since the days of the most remote past, testimonies had been adduced of people who were able to exercise a powerful influence with the look, the true method of bringing that about had in fact always been kept secret, or at least transmitted only on condition of maintaining a high degree of confidentiality. Even a very committed devotee of this type of subjects such as William Atkinson, who is one of the few people to have consecrated an entire book to the subject, one that bears the title of “Mental Fascination” 43, deals with it from the outside, in the process mentioning that he had interviewed some people, while clarifying the fact that had not been personally initiated to the technique. Likewise, Seligmann, a German ophthalmologist who authored in this regard a monumental work comprising more than 2500 literary sources he had quoted therein, had never been let in the art from inside.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of mental fascination has remained shrouded in secrecy throughout history despite numerous testimonies regarding its existence. While some authors have attempted to shed light on the subject, the true method of exercising this powerful influence with the eyes and the heart remains unknown. Nonetheless, the potential applications of this hidden power remain intriguing, and new insights may yet be gained in the future."
