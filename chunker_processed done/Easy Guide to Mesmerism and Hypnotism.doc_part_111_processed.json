  "first_phrase": "In this last 200 tokens of the text, the focus is on the actions that should be taken in case the patient has difficulty in opening his eyes or if he needs to be left alone to sleep. The author advises that the operator should rub the eyebrows to awaken the patient, and efforts must be made not to leave the patient until he is fully conscious. The mesmerizer needs to adapt the treatment according to the patient's temperament, and in some cases, the patient can be asked to wake up at a certain time. Lastly, the mesmerizer can use the power of the patient's mind to cure morbid habits like dipsomania.",
  "content": "“Should there be a difficulty in arousing the patient the mesmeriser may frequently bargain with him as to how long the sleep is to last; and should he promise to awake in the course of one or two hours, he will generally fulfil his promise by waking almost at the very minute named. The mesmeriser may also insist that his patient should awake at a certain time, and will in most cases be obeyed. “This power of acting or impressing the patient's mind may be carried into and continued in the normal or waking state, and might be used with good effect in treatment of dipsomania and other morbid habits so that the patient would in many cases, inconsequence of the impressions made during his sleep, be led to entertain an actual disgust at the mere smell of alcoholic liquor. “The patient during his sleep can frequently give valuable directions to his mesmeriser both as to the best methods of mesmerising him and the most effective means of terminating the sleep. In some rare cases the sleep is so prolonged, in spite of all the operator's efforts to dispel it, that he is alarmed, and the patient becomes affected in his fears.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of mesmerizing a patient’s mind can be extended to the waking state and be used for good, such as treating morbid habits like dipsomania. The mesmerizer needs to keep his presence of mind, and the patient should not be touched by anyone other than the mesmerizer. With these precautions and techniques, the mesmerizer can help the patient with little to no disturbance."
