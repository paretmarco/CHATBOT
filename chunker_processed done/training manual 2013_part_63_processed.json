  "title": "\"The Power of Symbols and Connection\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the concept of the \"green lion\" was introduced, which symbolises the state of connection with nature and one's true self. Fear, on the other hand, disconnects individuals from reality and causes them to focus only on certain aspects, losing sight of others. The second rule in magnetism emphasizes the need for physical and moral sympathy to establish communication between individuals. In this final section, the author explores the use of symbols and eggregores in ancient and primal cultures to govern human behaviour. By observing how everything is sacred in these cultures, we can understand the role of symbols in shaping our primal minds.",
  "content": "Physical sympathy is established by means which we shall indicate: moral sympathy by the desire of doing good to one who desires to receive it; or by ideas and wishes which, occupying them both equally, forms between them a communication of sentiments. When this sympathy is well established between two individuals, we say, they are in communication. 3. Use of Eggregores and symbols How a group where individualistic ego plays little or no role can rule itself? Jaynes, in \"the birth of the bicameral mind\" suppose that the ancient went through life like listening to their right hemisphere. In dealing with ancient poems as the Odissey, he sees that the protagonists are ruled by \"the voices of the Gods\". The interpretation of Jaynes is that is the left hemisphere speaking to the right. But Gods are for the civilized mind symbols. So the symbol is the key to understand how our primality works. If we see the life of some primal cultures still existing today we can observe as everything is sacred.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, establishing physical and moral sympathy can lead to a strong communication of sentiments. Additionally, the use of symbols and shared ideals can create a new entity that guides and rules individuals, making it possible for a group to function cohesively with little egoistic influence. By leveraging the power of symbols and shared values, individuals can work together towards a common goal, leading to a more harmonious society."
