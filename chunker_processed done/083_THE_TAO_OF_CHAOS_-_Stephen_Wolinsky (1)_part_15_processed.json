  "title": "\"The Role of Chaos and Order in Quantum Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we explore the idea that chaos is necessary for the emergence of higher orders. The text refers to quantum physicist David Bohm and his concept of implicate order, where particles and waves move together and the same substance. The second implicate order, according to Bohm, contains the information that organizes the whole system. However, attempting to manage chaos through subjective structures only perpetuates it. Instead, we need to allow chaos to reveal higher orders. The text also discusses Bell's Theorem, which states that there is no local cause in the physical universe and no location.",
  "content": "We all can feel that we resist chaos; we try to order chaos so 'See Chapter 20, The Organizing Principle, Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology by Stephen Wolinsky, Bramble Books, 1991. that our lives make sense, our world makes sense, and the universe makes sense. But by attempting to manage the chaos, or apparent randomness of the world, we have created separate subjective structures and internal universes to explain such things. Unfortunately, creating structures to manage or explain chaos continues the chaos. It is through allowing chaos that higher orders can be revealed (Discussed in Section II). Bell's Theorem John Stuart Bell, who I mentioned at the end of Quantum Consciousness Volume I, created one of the most powerful theorems in Quantum Physics. Noted physicist Henry Stapp calls Bell's Theorem \"The most imports. discovery in the field of science. \"2 Bell's Theorem says that there is no local cause in the physical universe and that there is no location in the physical universe. To look at this requires a very subtle inner vision.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, managing or explaining chaos through subjective structures only perpetuates chaos. Instead, allowing chaos to exist can reveal higher orders, as explained by Bell's Theorem in Quantum Physics. While it may be challenging to comprehend, the universe and its actions are ultimately causeless but have an underlying order that can only be understood through subtle inner vision."
