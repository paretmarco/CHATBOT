  "title": "Who was Chevalier de Barberini and the Barberinist school of animal magnetism in Lyon in 1784?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the magnetism practices of the 18th century, specifically the Chevalier de Barberini and the 'La Concorde' group. The text explores their ability to feel the ailments of those they were treating and how this relates to modern theories of empathy and quantum entanglement. The power of the Barberinist method was tested successfully in several experiments, including diagnosing an ailing horse with pinpoint accuracy. The Barberinist school later merged with a network of masonic lodges and became the \"magnetic branch\". This intriguing exploration sheds light on the early practices of magnetism and its association with other philosophies and schools of thought.",
  "content": "Another possible concept that can fit this case is the idea of ‘quantum entanglement’ The power of sympathetic diagnosis submitted to test The power of the barberininst method of diagnosis was put to the test during the summer of 1784 in three experiments at the Lyon Veterinary College with the cooperation of the director and various students120. All experiments were succesful and of a similar pattern. We will cite one of them: in the presence of a large number of witnesses two barberinist initiates, Millanois and Dutreich, were given an ailing horse to diagnose. They announced that the animal was diseased in the lateral and anterior part of the right lung, and in the left lung all over but particularly toward the sixth of the true ribs, and there were obstructions especially in the liver and spleen. These diagnoses were proved correct at autopsy. Further developments and theories of the barberinist school The Barberinist school merged and became the ‘magnetic branch’ of a network of masonic lodges (Bienfaisance) in which an important figure was J.B. Willermoz (1730-1824), disciple of Martinez de Pasqually. Another member was L.C. de Saint Martin (1743-1803) who later became known as the \"Unknown Philosopher\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of sympathetic diagnosis through the Barberinist method and their evolution into the magnetic branch of animal magnetism, as well as the development of Spiritualism, paints a fascinating picture of the exploration of the human psyche and spiritual world. Another possible concept that may fit this case is the idea of quantum entanglement."
