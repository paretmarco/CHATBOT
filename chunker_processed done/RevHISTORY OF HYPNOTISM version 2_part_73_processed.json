  "content": "If you had a pet, and it were sick, what would you do to help him, supposing there was something that you can do that could be useful for it? Resorting to words is certainly not useful. You would feel inside yourself that there are other powers besides words. First of all your heart. Compassionate thinking would help, but also a strong desire, energy, and the firm belief that you can do something. You would probably touch it, and you would use your hands. You would probably look at it. You would probably think of drawing energy from the Nature around you. Imagination Would you use ‘imagination’? Maybe you could imagine the pet in front of you as being healthy. You would rediscover in this way the meaning of the word ‘imagination’ as used by Sir Francis Bacon: “imagination is a force that exerts itself onto another body”. But also most of the time you didn’t imagine. You would simply stay in your feelings. Maybe by doing so, you would also rediscover more force in some particular objects or elements such as the sun in the sky. You would in this way naturally rediscover symbolism and its force.",
