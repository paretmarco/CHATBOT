  "title": "Understanding and Practicing Communicating-Passes, Lifting-Passes, and Imposition of Hands",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the use of repelling-passes in magnetic healing. Now, let's explore more communication techniques in magnetic healing. These techniques include \"communicating passes\" to help the magnetizer pass their thoughts to the subject, and \"lifting-passes\" to raise the subject's body without physical contact. These manipulations help to develop a latent will-power, and there are many methods of placing hands and working them over the body of the patient that produce different effects.",
  "content": "You place one or both hands within a quarter of an inch of his body, and gently raise them up and down, and when effectual, his body will, by Magnetic attraction and repulsion, rise or fall quickly, or slowly, exactly as you move your hands up and down. When you place your hands nearly on the body of your Subject, formulate in your mind that you are drawing up a cobweb by Will-power, and you will be greatly assisted. When a latent concentrated Will-power has to be developed such formulations are of the greatest value. Many other manipulations are alluded to in the course of these Instructions, and explained as they occur, but the above are the basis of all others, and the only ones truly essential for practice. You will stumble on dozens of methods of placing your hands on, and working them over the bodies of your Patients, and each will produce a different effect, which your Sensitive can describe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the imposition of hands is a powerful healing technique that requires focus and skill. By using the methods outlined in these instructions, you can develop your sensitivity to your patient's needs and produce a variety of healing effects. Experimenting with new ideas and carefully marking the results can help you refine your technique and become a more effective healer. Remember, the key to success is to approach this technique with a concentrated will-power and a desire to help your patients."
