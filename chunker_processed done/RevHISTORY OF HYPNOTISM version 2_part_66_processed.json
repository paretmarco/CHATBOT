  "content": "He was 44 years old by then. Mesmer addressed the knowledgeable bodies, pleading with their members to examine his doctrine, which was encapsulated in his famous twenty-seven enunciations . The knowledgeable bodies, however, examined nothing, and contented themselves with feigning an examination of Mesmer’s novel doctrine. The radical nature of his principles, as well as his assertion that it was possible to cure all diseases through a single remedy, brought upon his person the Faculty’s vituperation. The Royal Society of Medicine and the Academy of the Sciences, which were interconnected by joint membership to the same coterie, did not extend any better welcome to his submissions. In the course of nearly four years, while the said dogged fight was going on, Mesmer, with unparalleled cynicism, was mocked, insulted, vilified, and turned into a caricature, into a song, a target of ludicrous embodiment of venality, arrogance and disloyalty, in spite or rather because of the successes he had reaped throughout the world, as well as the warm protection he had received from the queen, not to mention the government’s tacit approval.",
