  "title": "\"Recovering Energy: Meditation, Hypnosis, and Alchemy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we discussed how meditation and hypnosis can help us recover energy that is drained by our ego. In this final part, we will delve deeper into the ancient paths of external and internal alchemy. Through external alchemy, we can recover energy by working on man and his perception, leading to the path of the sage. While in internal alchemy, we experience a new sense of globality through a concept known as \"Satori\". This text also introduces the graphic and symbolic idea of energy, Kundalini, or Azoth, that represents the primal state of human consciousness.",
  "content": "In internal alchemy there is the final path, a new experience of the globality. It is the concept of \"Satori\". As the Zen Buddhist D.T. Suzuki says: \"the individual shell in which my personality is so solidly encased explodes at the moment of satori. Not necessarily that I get united with a greater being that myself or absorbed in it, but my individuality which I found rigidly held together and definitely separate from other individual existence...melt away into something indescribable, something which is of a quite different order from what I am accustomed to. (The fall 267) FIFTH RULE IN MAGNETISM: when we magnetize we are bringing a person to what is his natural state Graphic and Symbolic Idea of Energy / Kundalini / Azoth This is the primal state: in theideal representation below, human is focused on his own consciousness andthe vital energy flows in Kundalini (also called “azoth” by western alchemists) .",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve a state of Satori, where one breaks free from the rigid individuality and experiences a new sense of globality in internal alchemy, it is crucial to maintain a balance between rationality and body awareness. The primal state of human consciousness taps into the vital energy flow of the Kundalini, which is often blocked by overthinking and losing touch with our bodies in modern society. Reintegrating real-time body awareness can help to recover the lost energy flow and lead to a renewed sense of vitality."
