  "title": "\"Exercises and Techniques for Improving Intuition and Perception\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, two exercises have been described that can help in attaining mental and physical stability. For someone who has achieved such a state, every imagination becomes a reality. The present moment becomes everything that's possible. In this last part, the concept of clairvoyance and clairaudience are discussed. These spiritual senses allow one to perceive the unseen elements in our reality. Mental lucidity is highlighted as the basis of intuition.",
  "content": "By transcending the ego, we will be enabled to let things manifest, whereupon it becomes possible to act directly on the body and suggest new ways of being. 113 CLAIRVOYANCE AND CLAIRAUDIENCE Clairvoyance and clairaudience depend on reintegration of elements we always have in our reality but that we don’t perceive. In doing them we recover what we could call sub-sensorialities or “spiritual senses” Clairvoyance During the “work in the white”, one can discern a series of perceptions which transcend the physical aspect. Such work is characterized by phenomena of “lucidity”. The word comes from the adjective \"lucid\", which is in turn related to the etymological root of the word “light”. In truth, light has always been related to having “clear ideas”, “a vision of the future\". Mental lucidity is the basis of intuition.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by transcending the ego and developing our sub-sensorialities or \"spiritual senses\", we can unlock our intuitive abilities and access a higher intelligence. Utilizing light as a tool for brain excitation can aid in this development. Embracing this journey allows for the reawakening of individual strengths and thought, expanding our potential for growth and self-realization."
