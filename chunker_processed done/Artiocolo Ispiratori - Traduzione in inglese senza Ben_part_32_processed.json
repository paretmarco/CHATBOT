  "first_phrase": "In this last section of the text, we delve into the Mesmeric and Symbolical Method of healing as proposed by F. A. Mesmer. The method involves the use of symbols and group formation to channel healing energy, with the operator acting as a conduit. Prior to this, the author discusses recharging the cervical plexus and other plexuses to enhance bodily functions. The Mesmeric Method offers a quick and effective means of healing, with a harmonical group proving to be a powerful tool in achieving this. The use of symbols and other elements further enhances the results of this method.",
  "content": "Notice should be taken of the fact that two plexuses, the carotid and cardiac ones, are susceptible of being recharged live in nature. 3 – MESMERIC AND SYMBOLICAL METHOD – HEALING due to symbols and to the GROUP for the purpose of restoring the individual to his own self - MESMER The method elaborated by F. A. Mesmer allows healing to take place quite rapidly, especially when a group is formed and symbols are utilized. In the last-mentioned instance, the operator becomes a conduit pipe to channel this energy. In fact from the moment we were born, we adapted to social pressures. Being in an harmonical group can be very powerful. Even people that don’t react to other methods will indeed change and transform themselves. By resorting to the mesmeric method, the operator establishes himself as the vehicle of a force. In addition to the aforesaid, symbols and other elements are used to further enhance the results harvested thereby.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the mesmeric and symbolical method of healing, developed by F.A. Mesmer, can produce fast and effective results, particularly when a group is formed and symbols are used. The creation of an energy field through the harmonical group alters the consciousness and produces a form-thought with intrinsic healing potential. This phenomenon can be explained through quantum disciplines, as concentrated attention can modify the ondulatory fields of our reality."
