  "title": "\"The Power of Mesmerism: Overcoming Separation and Tapping into Spiritual Force\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the rational mind as a construct that creates hierarchies within ourselves, similar to the ones we create in the world. The technique of mesmerism and hypnosis serves as transformational systems to heal psychological and civilized mind discord, unblocking the force of life and reconnecting us to our spiritual essence. The last part delves deeper into the nature of this force, as explained by Ercole Quadrelli. It highlights the endless craving and the incoercible flux that brings oneself in the river of life.",
  "content": "The technique of mesmerism does it in an even more direct way unblocking the force of life through movement. To better and more experientially understand this concept one must understand what this blocked force is, and we will use some of the words of an Italian writer, Ercole Quadrelli12: â€œThe life of all beings, without exception, is ruled by a primordial Force deep inside them. The nature of this energetic force is craving: an appetite that is never satisfied, an endless restlessness, an irresistible need, and a blind wild yearning. A person wants to become, to get results, to proceed in life. The essence of this primordial cosmic nature is: becoming; but sometimes also chaotic and disorderly transformation; in any case it is an incoercible flux. Is this force that brings yourself in the river of life. Sometimes you think this force doesn't exist because you just go pulled by the equal flow of life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the primordial Force that rules all living beings, as described by Ercole Quadrelli, can be experienced through different manifestations such as hunger, terror, and sensual thirst. Understanding and embracing this force can lead to a deeper connection with oneself and the source of life, allowing the energy to flow freely and merging with the deep functions of physical life."
