  "title": "\"What is Magnetic Magic and its effects on the human body?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding part of this text, the author discusses the power of the mind and the influence of suggestion through magnetic magic experiments that can cause nervous affections. The author questions the power attributed to magical ceremonies in these experiments and believes that it relies on the subject's weak and diseased imagination. In the last 200 tokens, the author reflects on their personal experience with magnetic magic and the physical sensations they undergo during the experiments. The author also mentions the use of magical circles and the attraction of spectators towards the charm.",
  "content": "When the experiences are to give a result, I participate in somewise in that which passes, my organism appears somewhat enchained, I can believe myself a part essential, even indispensable, finally a necessary element, in order that the operations of Magnetic Magic should take place. That is all. The rest depends, without doubt, upon the preliminary preparations. I silence within me all ideas that do not relate to the subject itself, and I have but in view the climax, which ever demands great prudence and attention. The Magical circles, of which I vary the dimensions according to my pleasure, are of about twelve centimetres diameter, and are, previous to the experiments, covered with an opaque body. From the moment when the Magical surface is uncovered, I stand quietly at a distance, watching attentively. It is then easy to recognise those of the spectators that the charm attracts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Magnetic Magic involves preliminary preparations and the use of magical circles that are uncovered to attract spectators. The charm can cause physical and emotional changes in those attracted, eventually leading them to the Magical sign. It is important to approach this force with great prudence and attention, as it appears to have an affinity with other subtle forces and virtues."
