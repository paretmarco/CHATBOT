  "title": "\"Information and Symmetry Breaking in the Evolution of the Universe\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking narrative, the author delves into the concept of symmetry breaking and how it leads to the process of crystallization, transforming water into ice. Skating on the solid ice, humans gain access to more information, as the increase in organization and information accompanies symmetry breaking. The author highlights the importance of remembering that we froze a reality rather than taking it as the only possibility. The mindset of allowing a part of our mind to stay in chaos can help us touch higher dimensions. The final part emphasizes the role of humans in earth and the need to develop awareness to return to the knowledge of the whole.",
  "content": "Doing this we \"freeze\" a reality and many times we forget that we ourselves \"froze\" it. So the key is to \"remember of ourselves\". The key for getting back to know the whole is in the awareness of ourselves. We must wake up our internal fire . And the sulphur is the symbol of the fire encrusted in the earth. Beginning to notice your kinaesthetic part, most of the time forgotten. Opening the gaze. These are the first steps in developing presence. Proceeding in this path can bring us both into creating in the universe as well as well in touching higher dimensions. And the human being is often represented with a cross where the frozen horizontal physical dimension is connected with the vertical line of awareness . Humans then are part of earth, Hermetists compared them to stones, that once cleaned, balanced and heated up can return to the knowledge of the whole. The basic concept here is information. The more we know, the more we define the system. This is a quantistic concept. We must allow a part of our mind to stay in the undetermined, in the chaos, becoming able to know the \"Cloud of unknowing\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing awareness of ourselves and our surroundings can lead to a deeper understanding of the universe and our place in it. By recognizing the interconnectedness of matter, energy, and information, we can expand our knowledge and tap into higher dimensions of consciousness. Remembering to stay open to the unknown and embracing the power of information can guide us on this path of evolution and organization within the universe."
