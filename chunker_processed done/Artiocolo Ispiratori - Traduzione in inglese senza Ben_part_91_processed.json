  "title": "\"Fascination and Hypnotism: The Astonishing Phenomena of Donato\"",
  "first_phrase": "This fascinating text delves into the work of a man named Donato who had the extraordinary ability to put people under his power with just a glance. The preceding passages describe how there were many who tried and failed to achieve what Donato could, through lengthy and sometimes tedious processes. Donato, undoubtedly, became a sensation of his time, having been able to convince over thirty young officers at the war school of Turin, Italy to perform imagined combat exercises simply by staring at them. This truly remarkable ability of Donato to exert power over people is explored in the following 200 tokens.",
  "content": "Almost all of them respond immediately to the power of his fascination, by turning stiff throughout their bodies; their faces become contracted, terrified, and sometimes cadaverous; they are at the mercy of the fascinator and follow his movements like a magnet [. . .] There is something pitiful, spasmodic in their features, something macabre in their gestures [. . .] Donato has all of them under his power, he attracts them in threes, in sixes, ten at a time, simply by rapidly staring at their eyes, even against their firm will and their obstinate efforts to resist his suggestion [. . .] Donato, in the process, never speaks: he thinks, he wants, and he points [. . . ]‚Äù. For example, in 1886, at the war school of Turin, having fascinated about thirty young officers, he made them go through their military exercises and take part in imaginary combats.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Donato's power of fascination had an overwhelming effect on his subjects, causing them to lose control of their bodies and minds. This ability, similar to hypnotism, allowed him to manipulate individuals and immerse them in his suggested scenarios, demonstrating the profound influence one person can have over another."
