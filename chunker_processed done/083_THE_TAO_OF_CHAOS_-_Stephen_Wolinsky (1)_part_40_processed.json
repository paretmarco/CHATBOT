  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned that psychological problems arise due to chronic body armor development. The solution is Bioenergetics, which works with bio-energy and chronic energy interruptions. But Chaos Theory suggests that if we expand the context of chaos, there will be order in chaos. Quantum Psychology states that if we allow energy to flow, it will reorder itself at a higher, more connected level. In the last part, we will explore the Tao of Chaos - the willingness to allow chaos to order itself, so that the experience of Quantum Consciousness can thrive.",
  "content": "If we resist the ripple by placing a circular wall around the ripple to contain it, the chaotic ripple will gain strength. If we expand the context of the ripple to include the entire lake, the chaotic ripple will reach a deeper connection to the rest of the lake. In the same way, the appearance of chaos within an individual system, if allowed, ultimately will take you to the entire lake THE TAO OF CHAOS • 23 (the implicate order). The Tao of Chaos suggests that by including, allowing, and expanding the context of individual chaos, infinitely if necessary, a new order is revealed. This means that emotions must be experienced and allowed \"as energy\"—the chaos must be allowed as energy. This nonresistance to chaos helps the person to reorganize themselves at a new level.' Stated another way, if you allow chaos, the underlying unity or united field that connects us will be revealed. This is the Tao of Chaos, the willingness to allow chaos, so that the experience of Quantum Consciousness can become even more available. More simply put; allow chaos to order itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing chaos and allowing it to unfold can ultimately lead to a new and deeper understanding of the underlying unity among everything. By expanding the context of chaos and experiencing it as energy, it can help individuals to reorganize themselves at a new level and discover their true selves. This is the essence of the Tao of Chaos, and by understanding and accepting this, we can experience Quantum Consciousness with more ease and availability."
