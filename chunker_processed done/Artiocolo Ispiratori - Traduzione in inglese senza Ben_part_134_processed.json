  "title": "Erminio from Pisa: The Master of Instant Fascination",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author discusses the extraordinary abilities of Professor Di Pisa. He was known for using post-hypnotic suggestions effectively and executing instant regressions to explore his patient’s past. Di Pisa's friend, Ezio F., had noticed that this personal magnetism could change the perception of the surrounding environment. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares two anecdotes about Di Pisa's fascination techniques. On one occasion, he was able to get more change from a girl by placing her in a trance-like state. Another time, a waiter had been so entranced by his look that he poured out multiple cups of coffee without realizing it. Although such methods are reminiscent of gypsy methods of fascination, Di Pisa maintained ethical standards and only used these techniques for curative purposes.",
  "content": "This kind of fascination, followed by an automatic motion, reminds one of some of the methods the gypsies use in order to fascinate. Professor Di Pisa, however, would only use such techniques for curative purposes. He was quite ethical in his work. In one instance, when we were at the restaurant, he wanted to give us a live teaching of how his look worked, and we were deeply impressed by it. He was extremely good at the so-called post-hypnotic suggestions, which he frequently executed by using some accompanying object. Erminio was also well-versed in instant regressions, that is, the situations where a person would access his past in a few seconds. This is a very powerful therapeutic dynamics. His friend, Ezio F., had observed that Di Pisa’s special ability to practice “personal magnetism” nearly changed the perception of the environment.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Erminio from Pisa's technique of \"Instant Fascination\" or \"Instant Hypnosis\" is a powerful therapeutic dynamic that has the ability to eradicate various physical ailments. Professor Di Pisa's ethical use of this technique was impressive, and his special ability to practice \"personal magnetism\" was observed even after his death. This technique can be life-changing for those suffering from physical discomfort and should be explored further in the field of medicine."
