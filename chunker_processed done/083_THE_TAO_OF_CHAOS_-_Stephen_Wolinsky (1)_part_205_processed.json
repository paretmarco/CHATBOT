  "title": "\"The Inadequacy of Personality Compared to Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text highlights the impact of the loss of essence, and how it results in the development of a false self and the observer/personality dyad. The last 200 tokens emphasize how the observer/personality dyad feels inadequate, and this feeling can never be resolved at the personality level because personality is inadequate compared to essence. Personal love is experienced as a transient state, and the true experience of love can only be achieved through essence. Essentially, the text suggests that the personality is inadequate compared to the essence and to truly experience love, one must be in essence, not in personality.",
  "content": "For this reason the observer/personality dyad is inadequate compared to Essence, and the issue of inadequacy can never be fully worked out at the level of personality. To restate, the deep feeling of inadequacy can never be handled on a personality level. Why? Because compared to Essence the personality is inadequate to get love. Love, for example, is the nature of Essence, not of personality. To say it another way, the personality appears to be looking outward comparing itself to others and hence feels inadequate. Actually, the personality is looking inwards and is comparing itself to Essence. In other words, personality is inadequate compared with Essence. To truly experience love, one must be in Essence, not in personality. Or stated another way, personality can experience personal love as a transient state. The station of love, however, is only intrinsic to Essence. From Essence to personality, there is a descent along the pendulum in a desperate search to return to Essence, but the mistake in fixation of attention strategy #1 is that the observer/personality dyad is looking outward for the perfection of Essence rather than inward at Essence itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the search for true love and perfection cannot be found solely on a personality level. It requires the recognition and connection with one's own Essence. By shifting the focus inward and acknowledging the inadequacy of personality compared to Essence, one can escape the cycle of resentment and embrace the inherent love and perfection within themselves."
