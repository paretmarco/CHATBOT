  "title": "\"Magnetic Attraction: Developing Sensitivity through Exercises\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the focus was on the phenomenon of magnetism and its effects on the hypnotized subject. Now, we delve deeper into the concept of \"sensibility to attraction\" or \"magnetic attraction,\" a little-studied phenomenon among hypnotists. We learn that this reflexive attraction can be developed and improved through magnetic education. With time, the subject becomes sensitive to various attractions and can understand the gestures of the magnetizer, leading to a perfect simulation of thought-transference. Eventually, the subject may even respond to the mere presence or mental action of the magnetizer. This section explains the step-by-step process of how this refinement of attraction comes into play in the hypnotic state.",
  "content": "The important point, the one that has to do with the matter in hand, is that this faculty, possessed by very many somnambules, may be cultivated and improved by magnetic education. Little by little the subject becomes sensible to various attractions, and if to the automatic attractions there be added quick understanding of gestures, then the subject possesses everything that is needed for a marvelously perfect simulation of thought-transference. This phenomena becomes, little by little, an unconscious-mind to unconscious-mind communication that will soon arrive at levels unexplained by ordinary means (our note) At first the subject is influenced only from anear, and can understand only simple movements; later he grows accustomed to his magnetizer's ways, comprehends his inchoate gestures, and an automatic association is formed between the almost unnoticeable directions of the experimenter and certain reflex, or even voluntary, movements of the subject. (Ochorowitz) Finally the phenomenon of bodily attraction produced by the mere presence of the magnetizer may be accentuated by the concurrence of mental action or even just be created by it.",
  "last_phrase": "By cultivating and developing magnetic education, individuals possessing subconscious abilities can communicate through unconscious-mind to unconscious-mind connection. This bodily attraction, which can also be created through mental action, is similar to the concept of quantum entanglement. Practicing exercises like magnetic passes can increase energy sensitivity and aid in developing these abilities for the communication of the subconscious."
