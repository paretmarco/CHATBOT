  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the role of the Master in universal construction, as a mediator between creative intelligence and objective creation. The Man-God, invested with spiritual power, must remain closely linked to the workers, shaping and directing their efforts with love and generosity. This is essential for success in the initiation, as the symbol of charity teaches us. The reward for this elevation of emotion and science is the Triangle of Solomon, forming the Macrocosmic Star or the star of the World at Large.",
  "content": "Hanging between the Abstract and the Concrete, between creative Intelligence and objective Creation, the Man thus conceived appears as a Mediator par excellence, or the true Demiurge of the gnostic schools. But in this sense, it is not enough to carry the light back to its primordial source; it is also necessary that he remain closely linked to the workers whom it is his duty to shape and direct. The essential bond here is that of sympathy. The master must make himself beloved, and he can have no greater success than by loving himself with a generosity that carries him to the point of absolute devotion, to the sacrifice of his own self. The Pelican is, from this point of view, the symbol of that charity, without which, in the initiation, everything would be irremediably futile. The most brilliant gifts of intelligence and will would make nothing but a false magician of the adept who has not nurtured the qualities of his heart. As for the reward of he who has become elevated by virtue of emotion as well as of science, it resides in the Triangle of Solomon. The two interlocking triangles form the Macrocosmic Star or the star of the World at Large.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the bond of sympathy between the master and the workers is essential for shaping and directing them. Without charity, intellectual and moral excellence are futile in the initiation of alchemy. The reward for mastering emotions and science is symbolized in the Triangle of Solomon, representing the union of God and nature. Investigating the context of alchemical paintings, like the one displayed in the Church of Saint Maurice in Reims, can reveal hidden meanings and interpretations."
