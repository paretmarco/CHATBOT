  "content": "The more you attain calm and emotional control, the more it will be possible for you to reduce the number of exercises and concentrate solely on the ones you feel are most beneficial for you. Never neglect, however, the exercises based on the look and the acquisition of control over your mental chattering. Prof. Di Pisa did not stop training his look daily even after years of assiduous practice, despite being always well trained in that regard. 8 – PRESENCE – The endpoint in Eastern and Western traditions – The Egyptian Tradition – Cagliostro, Kremmerz, magnetic therapy and presence-based therapy A common thread and tradition bind together some of the best healers in Western history, such as, inter alia, Paracelsus, Mesmer, Cagliostro and Kremmerz. This cementing bond is encountered in a number of exercises and stages and, above all, in a shared discipline of life, the goal of which is to nurture inward development.

  "last_phrase": "Incorporating exercises that prioritize calm and emotional control can ultimately allow for a reduction in the number of exercises needed, enabling one to focus on the most beneficial ones. However, it is important to remain committed to exercises aimed at gaining control over one's mental chatter. The concept of \"presence,\" based on an ancient Egyptian alchemical tradition, serves as a unifying thread among esteemed healers throughout Western history, emphasizing the active integration of one's abilities throughout every moment of the day. The Rosicrucians and similar organizations help to convey this traditional approach centered around the importance of presence."
