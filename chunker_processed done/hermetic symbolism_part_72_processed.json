  "title": "\"The Meaning Behind Alchemical Symbols and Hieroglyphs\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section delves into the alchemical symbols of Mercury and The Empress, and their significance in understanding the graphical language used by the disciples of Hermes. Mr. Limousin, a former editor of L'Acacia, draws intriguing connections between the two symbols, notably their androgynous nature. These symbols also lend themselves well to the composition of pentacles, which evoke complex ideas. The author notes that the two symbols can be summarized by the words of the Emerald Tablet: \"That which is above is the same as that which is below.\"",
  "content": "The Empress has the vessel pointing downwards to catch the mist that rises from the Earth: this then passes into the internal cavity and is resolved, by virtue of the cross, to take the form of ideas. The two symbols can be summarised by the words of the Emerald Tablet: ‘That which is above is the same is that which is below.’” We should note here that alchemical symbols lend themselves well to the composition of pentacles; that is, shapes that evoke complex ideas. If we place on top of and above we get two characters, one of which is the inverse of the other: The first of these calls to mind the divine Spirit, carried above the waters, exercising its influence on the soul from above; the second extolls the active fire, purified Sulphur dominating Gem Salt . On the one hand, the first matter is glorified by the achievement of the Great Work; on the other hand, the Celestial Virgin inspires the sacred ardour of the supreme love.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical symbols hold great significance in the composition of complex ideas through pentacles. By meditating on the hieroglyphs representing the descent of the Divine Essence and the ascent of the infernal Fire, we can understand their role in purifying the soul. Furthermore, the concept of \"I\" is nothing more than a phenomenon of interference and a mental optical illusion, reminding us to look beyond our limited sense of self."
