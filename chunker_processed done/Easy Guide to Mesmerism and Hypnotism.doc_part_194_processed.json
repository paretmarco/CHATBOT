  "title": "The Art of Mesmerism as an Entertainment",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author spoke about the prevalence of fake Mesmerism demonstrations that are deceiving the public. In this section, the editor emphasizes the importance of using Mesmerism as entertainment to build trust in the practitioner. The author explains that Mesmerism can be an innocent and enjoyable form of entertainment while also being instructive. The skilled Mesmerist can read the character of the subject and tailor the performance for each individual. To be successful in public performances, the operator must have considerable private practice and be prepared to handle any difficulties that may arise.",
  "content": "He will proceed accordingly, and endeavour to excite or exalt such faculties (by manipulation or suggestion, or both), which he desires to bring into plays. This he will accomplish much more successfully than an operator —however good a mesmerist—who cannot with equal facility read character. For public entertainments, as well as in every other sphere of abour, the keen-reader of character—all else being-equal—has the advantage over all others. What is true of the greater cannot be false of the less. Therefore, the mesmerist in this respect is no exception to the rule. To give a public entertainment it is a sine qua non that, for any hope of success in that direction, the operator has had considerable practice in private, therefore, he is at home in his work, knows what he is about, what he has to do and the difficulties with, which he has to contend. That he has recognised, and is prepared to successfully overturn, the difficulties which may arise from the capricious fancies of his audience, and such difficulties as may arise from having few none, or very subjects.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, a successful public mesmerist must possess not only mesmerizing skills but also a deep understanding of human nature and a keen eye for character. It is essential to have ample practice, perfect self-control, and command over the audience. The ability to avert disaster and turn failures into success is the hallmark of an accomplished mesmerist. With confidence, faith, and a sharp mind, the mesmerist can achieve success and entertain audiences with their powers."
