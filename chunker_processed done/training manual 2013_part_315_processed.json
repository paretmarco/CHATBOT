  "title": "\"The Power of Presence: Reintegration and Personal Growth\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed an exercise where a student must remain physically tense while focusing their mental energy on fulfilling a desire. In this final part, the idea of \"presence\" is introduced, where man is seen as the center of the universe and can reach a state of liberation through Reintegration. This leads to a natural healing ability and a more meaningful life, where synchronicity becomes more frequent. The author emphasizes the importance of this growth through presence, which has been known since ancient times but has been forgotten in modern education.",
  "content": "The knowledge that man lies at the hub of the universe, which has been retrieved by quantistic mechanics, already lay at the foundation of renaissance philosophy. Even prior to it, it was known by the most insightful intellects who emerged in the ancient Greco-Roman civilization, and by the ancient Egyptians, only for it to be subsequently put aside. The desire to proceed further and “climb up the energetic level” is intrinsic to every man. In order for this growth to become effective, however, it must be embarked upon in a state of real PRESENCE through Reintegration. A new condition will then arise: what was first a mere concept will eventually become the presence of a force, and a state of liberation will be reached, on which a new life may be built. According to tradition, the first result will be the “First Degree Medicine”. In other words, a natural healing ability. In life, coincidences and synchronicity then record an increased incidence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey towards real presence and energetic abundance through reintegration can help individuals achieve a state of liberation and natural healing abilities, unlocking higher levels of awareness and creativity. By consciously reintegrating, individuals can reach a sublime state where they become aware of the objective reality of the world and experience greater synchronicity in life. Ultimately, this can lead to a deeper understanding of the self and others, providing a pathway to enhanced consciousness and personal growth."
