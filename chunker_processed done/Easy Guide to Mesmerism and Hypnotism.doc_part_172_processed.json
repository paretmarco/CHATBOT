  "title": "\"The Gift of Healing: The Power of Sympathy and Will\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author highlights the importance of sympathy, will, and vital energy in healing. Without these, no amount of knowledge, technique, or remedies can enable one to heal. In the final part, the author emphasizes the value of manipulations and external remedies in hydropathy and credits their efficacy to the faithful observance of directions. The author also reminds us that the healing gift is inherent in all persons but is amplified by goodness and sympathy. Nevertheless, even the weak and delicate, when guided by a large heart and a focused mind, can accomplish much in bringing peace and healing to others.",
  "content": "The success which attends certain wonderful embrocations (which are often nothing more than simple and innocuous oils and newspaper puffs) may be traced to the faithful carrying out of the direction —”Rub in briskly with a warm hand for several minutes. External remedies possessing valuable properties are always rendered more efficacious by the observance of such directions. The healing gift is more or less enjoyed by all persons. The large hearted and intuitive physician, the mother, nurse, or friend, whose presence is more enjoyed, and whose advice is most desired by the sick, will have the gift in a large degree. Such gift, when exercised by goodness and sympathy, must ever have a wholesome and healing effect. The weak, tender, and delicate, when the heart and head work together, can accomplish much, however. The tired mother, wearied with nursing, does not lose her charm to soothe. Gentle and tender, ever more thoughtful of others than herself, her diligent hands bring peace and blessing with them at all times.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, external remedies can be made more efficacious when given with genuine care and love. The gift of healing is possessed by all, but it is the large-hearted and intuitive physician and the mother, nurse, or friend who exercise it with goodness and sympathy. By following simple directions and rubbing in briskly with a warm hand, one can experience significant relief in no time. Trust your instincts and be gentle, as the power of touch can do wonders in healing both the body and soul."
