  "title": "\"The Fear of Inadequacy: Finding Strength in Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding section of \"The Tao of Chaos,\" the author emphasizes that the fear of inadequacy is hidden beneath the surface of every personality. The observer/personality dyad constantly compares itself to the Essence and seeks strength and truth from external sources, as in the case of Sam. However, the author highlights that only by letting go of identity and being Essence can this fear of inadequacy be resolved. The author offers a practice of asking each identity what it truly desires, then allowing it to be reabsorbed into the emptiness of Essence. This section provides an insightful conclusion to the book's exploration of the human psyche and its connection to the Tao.",
  "content": "It was not until Sam could let go of the Identities and be Essence, which is strength and truth, that the obsessive compulsive strength seeking could be dissolved. As stated before, the inadequacy can never be worked out at the level of the observer/personality dyad. The inadequacy or fear of someone discovering the inadequacy must be worked out through the reabsorption of I-dentity back into the essential aspect it represents. Simply stated, the observer/ personality dyad is inadequate compared to Essence, hence, inadequacy can never be worked out at the level of personal- THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 219 Notice how to the I-dentity, the emptiness seems like death, but from the inside, the emptiness is calm, quiet, peaceful and serene. From inside the emptiness ask each Identity \"What is it you really want and are seeking more than anything else in the world?\" However the I-dentity responds, feel that quality of experience in the spacious emptiness. Next, have the I-dentities turn around and be reabsorbed within the emptiness which is Essence. Seeing the I-dentities in the foreground, stay in the background and notice the Identities are floating in Emptiness. Experience and feel the essential quality from the background.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to dissolve obsessive-compulsive behaviors and work through feelings of inadequacy, it is important to let go of identities and tap into one's essence. By reabsorbing the identities back into essence and experiencing their essential qualities, we can find peace and clarity to make important decisions in life."
