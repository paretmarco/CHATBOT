  "title": "\"The Influence of Phreno-Magnetism and Reichenbach's Odyle on Science\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the link between Phrenology and Magnetism is explored, and their alliance is shown to have injured Phrenology. The text concludes with the fall of Magnetism, which was thought of as disproven by the public after the doubts and disbelief in Phreno-magnetism. In the last part, the author presents the viewpoint of Gall, the great anatomist of the brain, and how he sought to establish Phrenology purely on the basis of observation, independent of any other sources such as Magnetism. The text also explores the views of other Phrenologists like Dr. Engledue and Dr. Elliotson, who were considered pronounced materialists, and the public's perception of their theories as an encouragement to crime and a danger to society.",
  "content": "Throughout many years, with infinite labour, Gall collected thousands of instance's of the simultaneous existence of an ‘organ’ and a faculty, in excess, or in deficiency; and those correspondences of faculty and brain substance were the data on which he relied; but when Magnetism became decadent, Phrenology suffered with it since the two things had become linked together in the public mind; for the world had forgotten that, whatever his followers and successors may have done, Gall himself, the great anatomist of the brain, had used only the strictest scientific method in locating the faculties in its different parts. Gall Of course, when Phreno-magnetism came gradually to be first doubted, and then disbelieved by many magnetizers who had at first accepted it, Magnetism itself was thought by the public to have been in a great measure \"disproved,\" and this, too, gave it a decided set-back.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Gall's work on phrenology was based on strict scientific methods despite its later association with animal magnetism and Reichenbach's ‘Odyle’ or ‘Od force.’ While these associations caused setbacks, Gall's contributions remain valuable in understanding the correlation between brain structure and cognitive function, and Karl von Reichenbach's work continues to inspire scientists to this day."
