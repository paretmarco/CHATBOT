  "title": "\"The Link between Success and Magnetic Factors: Insights from AFEM Research\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the extensive research conducted by the Association of French Electrical Maintainers (AFEM) on psychokinetic action and magnetic force, which can lead to success in life. The experiments were monitored by several contemporary university professors and enjoyed widespread resonance, even being quoted by Dr. Lefbure in one of his books. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli's observations provide further clarity on the need for a \"state of presence\" to accomplish the effects of these actions. Dr. Bruno De Michelis explains that learning to be present is an essential key to success, which is the groundwork for the last 200 tokens.",
  "content": "Everything seems, therefore, to confirm the point that the gift of success, leading life, that is, to one’s intended direction, has clear links with the well-known “magnetic force”, which is difficult to subject to empirical evaluation and which is nevertheless present, outwardly manifest in a plurality of ways, including psychokinetic action. Finally, the observations of Count Jean Pierre clarify that a “state of presence” is needed in order to produce a greater effect. Essentially that means having the necessary desire first, followed then by entry in a state of presence. This is an essential key. As stated by Dr. Bruno De Michelis, a former vice-champion of the world in Karate and an international researcher well-versed in states of presence, when he referred to techniques aimed at attracting good fortune in one’s life, such as the techniques set out in the book “The Secret”: “This book explain what has to be done, but, prior to that, we must learn to be present”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, cultivating a state of presence is an essential key to attracting success and good fortune in one's life. As emphasized by experts like Dr. Bruno De Michelis and Count Jean Pierre, this requires a strong desire followed by entry into a state of extreme presence. The study of magnetism is a valuable pursuit for investigating such experimental situations and developing one's sensibility, as evidenced by the fascinating phenomena observed at their courses."
