  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author delves into the practice of meditation in the School of Wisdom. The author suggests that meditation should focus on significant and disconcerting rites performed by masters, which are symbolic and require personal interpretation to gain deeper insights. The author emphasizes that true initiation cannot be achieved by mere ceremony or doctrine, but rather by spiritual work to decipher the great enigma of our existence. The reader is encouraged to delve deep into their own symbolic pool to seek the truth.",
  "content": "But why – he will ask – am I made to play out a mysterious role under the pretext of being initiated? In what, exactly, am I being initiated? In formalities which – I know – are symbolic. I find myself faced with symbols whose meaning I have to discover. If such an initiation is carried out with a good man, but one who does not see the other side of things, the ceremony is a formality, and ineffective from the initiatic point of view. No one becomes initiated by virtue of a ceremony, nor by assimilating certain doctrines that the masses know nothing of. Each person initiates him or herself, by way of spiritual work to decipher the great enigma that we are faced with in our objectivity. Speakers tell us of their own ideas, which are interesting to hear from the layman’s point of view, but which are better ignored if one is aiming to put oneself in a position to independently seek the truth. In order to discover it, we have to delve down into our own selves, right to the bottom of the symbolic pool where the pure divinity of the thinker chastely hides its nakedness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, true initiation cannot be achieved through formalities or assimilating doctrines but rather through spiritual work to decipher the enigma of our objectivity. This involves delving deep within oneself to uncover the hidden truths and then rising above to perceive the value of the everyday reality of appearances. As an actor in the play of life, one must use their insight to solve the puzzle and ultimately initiate oneself into the mysteries of existence."
