  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the concept of initiation and the use of imagery in leading initiates towards spiritual awakening. Now, we delve into the elements of hermetic ideography, including a circle with a cross, a triangle and a square inscribed within it. These shapes are linked to Pythagorean notions of Unity, Duality, the Ternary, and the Quaternary. The text examines the relationship between the shapes of the Cross, the Square, and the Triangle and the symbolism behind each of these figures in the hermetic tetrad.",
  "content": "Here we will simply show that the Cross with equal sized arms can easily be added to the Circle, in which the ideal conciliation of these two opposites can be written as ?. On the other hand, there is a clear relationship between the shapes of the Cross and the Square, the two sides of which form the Right Angle. There is less affinity between the Cross and the Triangle. Only the horizontal base of this figure is found also in the Cross, which is the great conciliatory element, the religious sign par excellence, the sign that binds and links, because of the way it revitalises and spurs to action. But we will not get ahead of ourselves in demonstrations before we have examined each of the factors in the hermetic tetrad, in turn: The Circle The most fitting way to represent Unity is to draw a single line whose ends meet and disappear. A simple line | is not so fortunate, because we recognise its shape as a line that has been cut off, an image of the Ternary, if its body and both ends are taken into account.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, understanding the relationship between shapes and symbols is essential in comprehending the deeper meanings and connections behind them. The intersection of the Cross and the Circle presents a great conciliatory element, while the Circle represents unity and the mathematical dot represents the universe. Each factor in the hermetic tetrad must be examined to fully understand their significance in the broader context of symbolism."
