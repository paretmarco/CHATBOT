  "title": "Understanding Magnetism: Principles and Practices.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author explains the principles of magnetism and the importance of establishing communication before treating a specific pain. In the final part, the author emphasizes the significance of intention in directing and concentrating the magnetic action towards the desired outcome. The author also describes the process of drawing away pain through magnetic passes, with specific examples given. The editor's note interprets this process as a non-verbal suggestion that speaks to the body. The use of gaze can also reinforce this method.",
  "content": "It is often impossible to draw a pain far from the part where it is fixed; and you will succeed solely by driving it off progressively, by little and little. A pain upon the top of the head, will be lessened at first in the centre, by waving the hands downward and outward, on the right and left. At every pass a portion will be dislodged and carried off. It will take more or less time to dissipate it entirely. Remember also the importance of INTENTION: The processes are nothing if they are not in unison with a determined intention. We may even say they are not the cause of the magnetic action; but it is indisputable that they are necessary for directing and concentrating, and that they ought to be varied according to the end one has in view. Editor’s note. We could even interpret this result of the movement that draws away the pain as a ‘non verbal suggestion’. We speak to the body with the movement, instead of saying anything. It is one of the simplest methods to begin with. This method can be reinforced with the gaze.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while drawing away pain with progressive movements and intention may take time, it is a simple and effective method to relieve pain in various parts of the body, such as the head or shoulder. Furthermore, using the gaze can reinforce this method and achieve faster results, making it a useful tool for anyone seeking a quick and non-invasive pain relief solution."
