Appendix 3 – Mental Fascination Fascination is a very old technique, and it is connected with the power of gaze. Fascination and personal Magnetism are strictly connected, as the eye is a tool permitting us to exert influence directly on other people. In the eye there is also something more, because with eye movements we directly affect the brain. Scientific researchers have proven that there is always a reaction to the gaze. In order to develop this skill it is important to do a specific training. Even if there are people whose eyes are very expressive, no normal person is able to fascinate without training. The training is both a mental as a physical one.",
