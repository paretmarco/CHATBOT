  "title": "\"The Petrifying Gaze: Virgilio's Ability to Control Others\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the fascinating abilities of a man named Virgilio, exploring the concept of non-verbal communication and telepathy. The earlier portion describes an exercise in which he makes people walk faster by visualizing a pool of water ahead, while the latter part delves into his astounding ability to induce various states in people through sheer force of will, including petrification and the ability to mentally transmit songs. Virgilio's unique approach to hypnosis is not something found in modern texts, making him a truly unique individual worth exploring.",
  "content": "On a number of disparate occasions, he has in fact succeeded in making some subjects sing songs which had been mentally passed onto them beforehand. In another instance, he made us attest such ability of his by turning me voiceless only through his look. Once, a person challenged him, whereupon his challenger began to feel as if his face was being turned into stone merely as Virgilio was busy taking off his glasses. This theme of “petrifying” the subject is indeed one of the characteristic features of Virgilio’s fascination. That is moreover a state which no modern book on hypnosis bothers to describe. After the relevant person has been “petrified”, i.e. his face has taken on a lifeless expression, totally plunged, as Virgilio calls it, into “a passive consciousness”, this whole process engrossing Virgilio for no more than four seconds approximately, he moves onto the suggestive phase, the one where the subject supinely carries out instructions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio's ability to petrify and then suggestively control his subjects may seem like something out of a mythical tale, but it is indeed real. It is a unique skill that he has developed through a heightened sense of sensitivity, which he acknowledges himself. While it may seem like a fascinating phenomenon, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential dangers of such control over another person's consciousness."
