  "title": "\"Finding Perfection in All the Wrong Places: The Search for Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding section, the text discussed the concept of the personality attempting to substitute for the perfection of Essence, leading to a dualism of trying to be perfect yet feeling unworthy. In other words, it showed how individuals could seek perfection outside of themselves by looking in all the wrong places, such as observing their personality and the world through a substituted image of perfection. The upcoming section highlights the self-therapy, which is about shifting one's focus of attention from outward trance to the trance-ending of Essence. It emphasizes that individuals should not label Essence as imperfect and should switch their attention to a more positive space.",
  "content": "There was a story told to me while I was in India. Several Gods had gotten together to decide where to bide the key to a person's nature, i.e., Essence, so that people would never find it. One God said, \"Why not hide it on top of the Himalayas?\" Another God replied, \"No, people would eventually find it.\" The second god said, \"Why not hide it at the bottom of the ocean?\" \"No,\" replied another, \"Someday, they will reach the bottom of the ocean.\" The third God said, \"Let's hide the key (Essence) inside of people, they will never think to look there.\" This is the plight of us all: \"Looking for ourselves in all the wrong places.\" The Self-Therapy The self-therapy asks individuals, who find themselves stuck in this fixation of attention, and who label essence as imperfection, and over compensate with over perfection and moralistic virtue, to shift their focus of attention. This shift changes the outward trance or I-dentity to the trance-ending of Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the story about the hidden key (Essence) inside each of us serves as a reminder that true self-discovery is often hindered by our fixation on external factors. The self-therapy outlined here encourages us to confront our inner emptiness and shift our focus to our true essence. By identifying our over-compensating identities and exploring our inadequacies, we can experience a more authentic and fulfilling sense of self."
