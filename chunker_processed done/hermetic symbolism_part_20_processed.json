  "title": "\"Unity and Geometry: Exploring Symbols and Shapes\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, we delve into the relationship between the Cross, Square, and Triangle, as we explore the concepts of unity and infinity. We see that the Cross can be easily added to the Circle, creating the ideal reconciliation of opposites. While the Triangle has less affinity with the Cross, as it only shares its horizontal base. Before demonstrating these concepts more fully, we take a deeper look into the factors of the hermetic tetrad, such as the Circle, which is the most fitting way to represent Unity, and the mathematical dot as a symbol of the Universe.",
  "content": "It is true that this Ternary is found in any symbol, as even the Circle defines a limited circumference that separates the content within it from the surrounding infinity. Strictly speaking, the Universe is not representable: one can conceive of it but it cannot be seen anywhere. The best symbol to represent it is the practically imperceptible mathematical dot, which we should situated in an abstract shape, at the intersection of two lines or in the centre of a circle. It is from this practically non-existent point that the line starts, as it begins to move into space. Born out of nothing, the line, as it moves forward or curves around on itself, gives us a shape to comprehend which in turn can be raised, lowered, swung around on one of its sides to give us the idea of a three dimensional body. This generation is intellectual, and the human spirit of inquiry creates geometry from nothing in much the same way. The impossibility of forming a realistic idea of Unity obliges us to return to the circle, the conventional emblem of something that has no beginning or end.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the Universe is incomprehensible and cannot be represented by any tangible symbol, geometry allows us to generate shapes and bodies from nothing. The circle, a conventional emblem with no beginning or end, symbolizes the unity of everything that exists and can be imagined. The motto \"One is All\" accompanying the image of the Uroboros reminds us of the relative value of things and the concept of the first matter of the Great Work. Ultimately, this concept of Everything-Nothing or Nothing-Everything cannot be defined with words, but serves as a reminder of the limitations of our perception and the vastness of the unknown."
