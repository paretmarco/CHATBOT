  "title": "\"The Petrifying Power of Virgilio: A Hypnotist's Exceptional Abilities\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text recounts a fascinating story of how Virgilio, a skilled hypnotist, manages to petrify his subjects before hypnotizing them. Virgilio's ability to induce a passive state of consciousness is far more advanced than what modern hypnosis books teach. His mastery over the suggestive phase is impressive. This skill may have inspired legends about the mythical being Medusa who petrifies people. It's apparent that Virgilio's exceptional abilities are the result of his heightened sensibility, allowing his two hemispheres to act simultaneously. This final section delves deeper into the techniques and abilities of the hypnotist Virgilio.",
  "content": "In Virgilio’s case, more than the initial induction, the problem is how to maintain control over the subject, since the latter does sometimes reacts too strongly. What Virgilio practices reminds one of the actions of Medusa, the mythical being used to petrify the people she looked at. It is likely that the legend was inspired by events such as the ones involving Virgilio, which later turned into myth. Bit by bit, as we kept his company, we have also come to realize that those exceptional abilities of his were also the result of having developed his sensibility. After all, that is something he himself admits, adding that he is aware of that fact: “There is something mysterious, which causes the two hemispheres to act simultaneously”. The two hemispheres he is alluding to are the receptive hemisphere of sensibility and the active one respectively.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio's exceptional abilities are a result of his heightened sensibility, which he has honed through alternate breathing and sensory inversion exercises. His control over his subjects, though sometimes reminiscent of Medusa's petrifying gaze, is a testament to his fascinating power. As a painter, Virgilio's distinct sensibility is reflected in his art, leaving a lasting impact on those who witness it."
