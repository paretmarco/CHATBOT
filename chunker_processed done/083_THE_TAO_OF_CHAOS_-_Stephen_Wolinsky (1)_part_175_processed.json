  "title": "\"The Holy Hole: Embracing Emptiness to Access Real Self\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author describes the I-dentity's resistance to the gap, a natural process in which the self disappears, leading to more chaos, pain, and fear. However, the gap is a gateway to a higher level of being. The text highlights that therapy is about being willing to go through this emptiness, use it as a gateway, and reabsorb dysfunctional I-dentities back within oneself. The text also introduces the Enneagram system, which describes nine basic personality types, offering a map of I-dentities and the ability to notice and detach from one's \"chief feature.\" In the last part of the text, the author dives deeper into the significance of the Enneagram system and how it helps predict the next motion of the mind.",
  "content": "This is what the therapy is about, being able to enter through the hole, as a gateway into Essence and your Real Self, and reabsorb the dysfunctional I-dentities back within the self. The entrance through the holy hole in the body into Essence can be viewed as a right of passage. Why? Because the Essence is one step closer to the you of Quantum Consciousness than the personality, and secondly, because once you become established in this level of being, I-dentities lose their strength and your real self emerges and you begin to live from Essence. The Enneagram The enneagram is an ancient system from the middle east which describes nine basic personality types. Any student of the enneagram soon realizes that although there is one major type which she/he falls into, the enneagram has motion and does not remain fixed. Consequently, we all contain every THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 139 type, with one type being our most used strategy. The enneagram serves as a map of I-dentities, showing us where we are, giving us the ability to notice and detach from our \"chief feature\" or chief strategy or chief trance hopefully, to be able over time to predict the next motion of the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy described aims to help individuals enter through the \"holy hole\" in their body to reach their Essence and Real Self, and ultimately reabsorb their dysfunctional I-dentities. The enneagram serves as a map to help individuals recognize their chief strategy for defending against inner emptiness, which is their Real Self. By integrating the enneagram with traditional psychotherapeutic diagnosis, individuals can understand their I-dentity structures and access their inner essential qualities to return to their Real Self."
