  "title": "\"The Gut-Brain Connection and the Role of Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the link between the gut and the brain has been established. This connection controls our actions and emotions, making them strongly influenced by the visceral component. The use of magnetic methodology enables us to work on these internal variables silently and aid in immune system response. The gut is an essential link between the nervous and immune systems, and it had been recognized by ancient Eastern and Western medicines. The chakra of emotion and instinctive response, located in the stomach, plays a crucial role here. In this final part, we will explore how manual and visual techniques can aid in healing and unblocking emotions, as demonstrated by F.A. Mesmer.",
  "content": "The fact that the belly represented a preferential point within the emotional component was a truth already known by ancient forms of medicine, both Western (specifically the ones from which magnetism springs forth) and Eastern. One can discern interesting concordances with the Japanese methodologies wherein the hara is vested with extensive importance as a centre of energy. In addition, many traditions speak of chakras, that is, the areas where the energy exchanges between body and environment take place. The chakra of emotion and instinctive response is located in the stomach, and is given in the West the name chakra of the solar plexus. Our first-hand experience has subsequently confirmed to us what even F.A. Mesmer already used to practice: The look, by halting thought processes, is able to help and speed up the unblocking of emotions. In addition, it is still possible even to operate purely in a manual way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ancient forms of Western and Eastern medicine both recognize the importance of the belly as a center of energy. The chakra of emotion and instinctive responses is located in the stomach, which can be unblocked through manual or visual techniques. The pioneering work of Baron du Potet has played a major role in the development of French magnetism, which has since branched out into a range of groups. By understanding these concepts, we can tap into our own intuition and learn to harness the power of our energy centers for improved emotional health."
