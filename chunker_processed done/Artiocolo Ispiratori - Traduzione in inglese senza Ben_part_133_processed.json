  "title": "\"The Fascinating Techniques of Professor Di Pisa\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the incredible hypnosis skills of Erminio Di Pisa. He used to fascinate people not only in his study but also in everyday life. In this last part, we witness the practical application of his mesmerizing abilities. One of his friends asked if he could get back more change than he paid. To prove his point, Di Pisa hypnotized a girl and repeatedly made her give him more change. The girl had no idea what was happening until he snapped her out of the trance. This incident highlights the extent of Di Pisa's influence on people's behavior.",
  "content": "As a result of that, the waiter mechanically began to prepare a first cup of coffee, followed by a second and a third one, placing all of them on the counter, and went on doing that non stop. It was only then that Erminio “woke him up”. The waiter had been blissfully unaware of the whole incident! On yet a different occasion, Roberto Catalano asked him whether he, too, was able to get back as change more than what he would actually pay. Di Pisa immediately replied in the affirmative. As a bet, he handed ten thousand liras to a girl, and, looking into her eyes with an intense expression, he said to her, ‘More, more, more.’ The girl then continuously gave him change without realizing what she was doing. Eventually, Di Pisa said to her, ‘You have given me too much change’, and gave the excess sum back to her.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Professor Di Pisa had a unique talent for post-hypnotic suggestions and accompanying objects that he executed for curative purposes. Although the methods he used to fascinate were reminiscent of gypsy techniques, he was ethical in his work and never used them for personal gain. His live demonstration of how his look worked was deeply impressive and showed his expertise in his field."
