  "title": "\"Activating the Enteric Brain for Healing: The Power of Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve into the power of magnetism and its ability to activate our enteric brain, more specifically the hara center and solar plexus. The author explains a step-by-step guide to magnetize a person, including placing the hands on the shoulders, pit of the stomach, and even down to the feet. The importance of turning the palms of the hand outwards and never magnetizing from the feet to the head is emphasized. This technique is significant as it works to activate our second brain for true healing.",
  "content": "When you feel an equalization of temperature, the hands are to be gradually lowered to the knees, then earned to the head, and again brought down to the knees, or even to the feet; this process is to be continued for some time, always taking care to turn the palms of the hands outwards, whenever they are brought up; this, as well as never to magnetise from the feet to the head, is very essential.\" One of the reason this kind of magnetism is so powerful is probably because it activates our enteric brain, corresponding to the solar plexus and our hara center. Most of existing therapies and methods work as there it is just one brain, the brain in our head that rules our body, but this is not true. If we want true healing we must activate a second brain that many times we even donâ€™t suppose to have.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating techniques that activate our enteric brain through the solar plexus and hara centers can vastly improve our overall health and well-being, as this second brain plays a crucial role in our body's immune response and ability to function properly. By taking the time to activate and nourish both brains, we can experience true healing and a harmonious mind-body connection."
