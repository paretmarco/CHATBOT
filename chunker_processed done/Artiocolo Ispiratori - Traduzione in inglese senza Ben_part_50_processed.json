  "title": "The Life and Travels of Mesmer, Creator of Mesmerism",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we followed the rise and fall of Franz Mesmer's career and his controversial practice of animal magnetism. The last 200 tokens of the text provide a concluding section, tying up the loose ends of Mesmer's story. We learn of Mesmer's disciples Puysegur, Orelut, and Giraud reporting on bouts of healing while Mesmer's discipline, Deslon, was subjected to examination by the Academy. Despite his sympathy towards the revolutionary ideas, Mesmer was forced to flee France due to an economic dispute with the Harmony Society. Mesmer continued to write retorts against his accusers and made trips to France in disguise. Amidst the revolution, Mesmer sympathized with the ideas but his noble disciples suffered for their errors.",
  "content": "Once he was gone, his opponents went on a rampage, causing Mesmer to spend a lot of time writing retorting libels which targeted their accusations. He spent a short time in London before he set out for Italy and Germany, while still making some trips to France, strictly in disguise. He was for example spotted in Paris on the day of the public execution of Bailly, who had been one of his most passionate antagonists and had chaired the 1784 Commission. Mesmer was the only person, amid an audience intoxicated by fury or paralyzed by fear, to cordially greet him 8. Immediately thereafter, in fact, the revolution broke out in 1789. Its avalanche caught his noble disciples as well. Nearly all the members of this cream of gentlemen, perched at that time on the summit of the collapsing building, atoned for their errors. As for the rest, they forgot about mesmerism, embroiled as they were in the unfolding of such colossal drama. Meanwhile, the creator of mesmerism sympathized with many of the ideas the revolution had highlighted.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmer's life was marked by controversy, political upheavals, and personal tragedies. Despite the setbacks, he remained committed to his ideas and continued to explore the world of mesmerism until his last days. His legacy lives on as his work has inspired countless others to explore the mysteries of the mind and the power of suggestion."
