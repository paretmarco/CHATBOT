  "content": "The poles are important because through magnetism, we establish contact not just with the mind, but with the body as well, nay, especially with the body. It is precisely by using the body as our departure point that we are capable of acting directly both on a full range of physiological functions and on the physical foundation of emotions. Each emotion has indeed its own physical equivalent it is related to, in the form of a specific sensation which is experienced in the body. If, for instance, we are ‘tense’, what we are experiencing consists in a physical sensation, just as being ‘enraged’ is an event which is lived (for most people) at the level of the stomach. The problem, normally, is not represented by the existence of the emotion per se, but in the fact that such emotion remains ‘trapped’ in the body. Magnetism offers us a very simple and harmonious way of releasing these trapped emotions. How to release emotions In the ordinary course, our thought processes are what give rise to such a trapping block; and they have a propensity to perpetuate it. When it comes to animals and children, emotion does not last long.",
