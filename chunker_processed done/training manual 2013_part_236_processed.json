  "title": "\"Trance Induction Techniques: Four Steps to Follow\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses techniques to induce a trance state in a subject, using physical movements and touch to saturate different parts of the body. The last 200 tokens delve into the concept of saturating the left hemisphere by touching the right side of the body or shoulder, as well as using divergent gaze to entrain the subject after working on the right side. The text also explores the principles of muscular effort and mental commands to drain energy and achieve a state of dark focus. Various techniques and methods are presented, including the Gypsy method and the Hermetic Caduceus exercise.",
  "content": "TOUCHING THE LEFT HEMISPHERE THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE This is a subtle secret to begin with to get the most of the results: saturating the left hemisphere. This could be done looking at the right eye (of the subject) as in the exercise of the hermetic caduceus and/or touching the right side of the body or shoulder (see below Virgilio’s method)). Touching another person can generate mutual trust, sympathy and charm. Modern science has confirmed this ancient discovery. Touching the right hand could be very strong as the hand is present in the cerebral cortex in a big part of it. Therefore, mastering the right hand, you possess the influence on the cerebral cortex, that is, the impact on the consciousness and subconscious, obviously if the contact is sincere and sympathetic. DIVERGENT GAZE – AFTER HAVING EXCITED RIGHT SIDE (Gypsy method) Also divergent gaze, if done after having worked on the right side will be very strong for « entrancing the subject ».",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating these techniques into your interactions and personal practices could enhance your ability to influence consciousness and subconsciousness. Remember to approach each contact with sincerity and sympathy to achieve the most effective results."
