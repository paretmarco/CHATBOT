  "title": "Comparison of Hypnotism and Mesmerism: Methods and Effects",
  "first_phrase": "This article highlights the different modes of inducing hypnotic states as explained by two experts, Dr. Braid and Prof. Heidenhain. In the last 200 tokens, the article delves into the distinction between physiological hypnotism and Mesmerism. While in Mesmerism, the 5th and 6th degrees are induced, in hypnotism, the senses are exalted and their power intensified. The hypnotic state creates any illusion as a reality while the subject is entirely unconscious of the pain of a surgical operation. The article also touches on the sensitivity of subjects to determined suggestion, which can induce hypnotic conditions.",
  "content": "Heidenhain, by the well-known connection of the skin to the nervous system, produces weariness in the censorium—-through the inhibition of the sense of feeling—by stroking the skin; of hearing, by the monotonous ticking of the watch. The persons operated upon are necessarily pretty sensitive to his will, expressed by determined suggestion. A sudden fright has been known to produce the hypnotic condition. I have seen a cat catalepsed on a yard wall by a broom being thrown at it; a thief catalepsed at the sudden fear of detection. Editor’s note: We can call these last two types of hypnotism “Physiological Hypnotism,” very akin to fascination. Hypnotism is not Mesmerism. In Mesmerism the 5th and 6th degrees previously referred to are frequently induced—in Hypnotism never. In the mesmeric state the senses, as a rule, are temporarily suspended—the subject feels, tastes, or smells in sympathy with or through his mesmeriser; in the hypnotic state the senses are exalted, their power intensified as already described. In the former the mental faculties have a refined, definite, and coherent action; in the latter, as in dreaming, any illusion created by the operator appears to be a reality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while physiological hypnotism and mesmerism share some similarities, they differ in their effects on the senses, mental faculties, and physical state of the subject. Hypnotism exalts the senses and can induce convulsive movements and nausea while mesmerism suspends the senses temporarily, allowing for calm and curative sleep. Understanding these differences can aid in proper application and treatment in hypnotic and mesmeric practices."
