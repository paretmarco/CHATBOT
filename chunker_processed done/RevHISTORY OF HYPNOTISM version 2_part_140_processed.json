  "title": "\"The Medical Value of De Puysegur's Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the remarkable achievements of de Puysegur, a mesmerist, in exploring the prophetic and clairvoyant abilities of mesmeric patients. In the last 200 tokens, the author provides full details of the observation carried out by de Puysegur and a valuable contribution on the same subject by Cloquet. The patients' eyes were closed, and there was no sense of hearing, unless it was awakened by the master's voice. De Puysegur aimed at curing diseases through Mesmerism, which was also the goal of Mesmer. His successes in achieving this objective served as an inspiration for future students of the subject interested in investigating the therapeutic potentials of Mesmerism.",
  "content": "De Puysegur gives full details of the cases of both this and the simpler kinds of clairvoyance — in reference to the patients' own illnesses — that he had the opportunity of observing. De Puysegur “Artificial somnambulism” Cloquet, an eye-witness,77 has given us some valuable information on the subject. He says that the patient's eyes were closed, and there was no sense of hearing, unless it was awakened by the master's voice. Care was taken not to touch the patient during his crisis, nor even the chair on which he was seated, as this would produce suffering and convulsions, which could only be subdued by the master. To rouse them from the trance, the master touched the patient's eyes, or said, \"Go and embrace the tree.\" Then they arose, still asleep, went straight to the tree, and soon afterwards opened their eyes. As soon as they returned to a normal condition, the patients retained no recollection of what had occurred during the three or four hours' crisis. But it was the cure of diseases at which de Puysegur aimed: therapeutics was his object, as it had been that of Mesmer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the phenomenon of artificial somnambulism, as observed by de Puysegur, reveals the potential for patients to possess supernatural healing abilities during their trance-like state. Touching the patient or providing verbal cues can awaken this ability, allowing somnambulists to locate the source of pain and suggest fitting remedies. This could offer a promising avenue for further exploration in the field of therapeutics."
