  "first_phrase": "This text explores the practice of mesmerism in India and how it was associated with religion. In the previous passages, Esdaile, a prominent mesmerizer, was mentioned to use the technique to paralyze subjects. Additionally, it was explained how Esdaile found that mesmerism was already known to the \"holy men\" and Faquirs of India. The last 200 tokens present a curious case of a poor young Hindoo female who was suffering from epilepsy and fits of insanity caused by a previous famine. The case highlights the potential effectiveness of mesmerism as an alternative treatment for certain conditions.",
  "content": "Being requested to explain himself, he continued, ‘Many of my people, after I had tried to cure them of their different complaints in vain, used to ask leave of absence for several weeks, in order to be treated by the ]adoo-walla, and to my great surprise they often returned to me quite cured in a short time; and in reply to my enquiries as to how they had been treated, they all said that they had gone through a process called Jar-phoonk; the meaning of which I could never make out. But I see it now before me, in the continuous stroking and breathing of your mesmerisers. Jarna means to stroke in Hindoostanee, and phoonkna to breathe, which very exactly describes your mesmeric process.'\" Esdaile also quotes from the “Zoist\" the curious experience of Colonel Bagnold, with which my notice of this great mesmeriser must end:- \"A poor young Hindoo female had fallen into a miserable state of health, the effects of great privation during the previous great famine, was epileptic, and subject to occasional fits of insanity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these historical accounts of mesmerism and energy healing practices highlight the power of belief and suggestion in the healing process. While the specific techniques and rituals may vary across cultures and time periods, the underlying principle of using mindset and intention to promote wellness have persisted throughout human history."
