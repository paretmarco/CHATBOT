  "title": "The Diversity of Opinions in Mesmerism",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author delves deeper into the intricacies surrounding mesmerism, uncovering the various opinions held by researchers and practitioners alike. The text highlights that even though phenomena related to mesmerism were not new, there were still varying opinions as to their significance and authenticity. The text explores differences in theories and practices among mesmerizers, including their views on somnambulism and the existence of the \"fluid.\" Some considered certain discoveries, like cerebro- or phreno-magnetism, to be more beneficial than curing disease, while others saw them as complete delusions. The text concludes with varying opinions on the dangers and benefits of Magnetism and the types of subjects that made the best test subjects.",
  "content": "Those phenomena, although briefly describable in general terms, vary immensely in detail; and their description is scattered through hundreds of forgotten treatises, pamphlets, journals, memoirs, and reports. The phenomena in question vary extremely even in the same subject, from one occasion to another; and there is hardly an item, either of theory or practice, about which differences of opinion did not exist among the mesmerizers themselves. For example, Dr. Elliotson, who may be regarded as one of the latest of the “early fathers” of Magnetism, never consciously exerted any will power, and attributed all the effects to the manipulations. Again, Dr. Bertrand wrote a valuable book on Somnambulism (in 1828), and yet he looked upon Animal Magnetism (the \"fluid\") as a “chimera,” Some magnetizers regarded Cerebro- or Phreno-magnetism as a discovery due to Mesmerism which was fraught with more benefit to humanity than even the cure of disease; while others considered it a complete delusion. Some writers give emphatic warnings about the dangers of Magnetism; others declare that it never does any harm. Some say that the strong and healthy are the best subjects, others the weak and diseased.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the study of magnetism and mesmerism throughout history has shown vast discrepancies in theories and practices surrounding the phenomenon. It is important for researchers to consider and explore these varying opinions and experiences in order to fully understand the complexities and potential of this field."
