  "title": "\"Effective Hypnosleep Induction Techniques: Tips and Guidelines\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned that a subject must be sound asleep before a Hypnosleep induction can begin. This means that the subject must perform seven complete respiratory cycles or less per minute. In the last 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the process of the induction, such as waiting for the subject to be deep enough and using a specific phrase to reach the subject's subconscious. Additionally, the author introduces the concept of an ideomotoric signal, which will help establish contact with the subconscious mind.",
  "content": "After this you repeat the following phrase several times (six or seven could be enough), so that the subconscious is able to receive and understand it and synchronize at best the speaking out of the three different parts of the phrase with the subjects breathing, like this: INHALE “You can hear me ….” EXHALE “…but you can’t wake up…” PAUSE “…remain deep asleep” Please note that we will be contradicting the correctness of the above mentioned statement, which uses a negation (“can’t”), when we will speak of the appropriate subconscious language to utilize. Anyway, for all practical purposes, this will work. After having repeated this enough times, we need to know if we have established contact with the subconscious mind through the use of an ideomotoric signal. An ideomotoric signal is something like a “reflex” that the subconscious gives on its own when asked for it, with no conscious effort at all or like Bandler, the founder of NLP would suggest “with honest unconscious movement”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by repeating the suggested phrase and utilizing ideomotoric signals, it is possible to establish communication with the subconscious mind and induce Hypnosleep. Remember to use clear instructions and avoid kinaesthetic stimulus without prior communication to enhance the building of trance. With practice, this technique can be an effective tool for relaxation and achieving a deep state of sleep."
