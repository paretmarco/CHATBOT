  "title": "\"The Mesmeric Method: Gentle Manipulation Techniques for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the older methods of mesmeric treatment and emphasizes the importance of perseverance, patience, and slow work to achieve positive results. The author explains the process where the hands are placed above the head and brought down to the pit of the stomach to treat the patient. The hands are then moved slowly along the body to the feet, and the process is repeated. In the last 200 tokens, the focus shifts to Mr. Colquhoun's method of magnetic treatment, who emphasizes the importance of manipulating the patient's body in one direction, downwards from the head to the feet, to avoid any counteractive effects. The text provides an intriguing insight into the methods of Mesmerism and demonstrates how these practices evolved over time.",
  "content": "The desired results will take place at the end of the second or of some subsequent sitting. Slow work, one would think; yet this is a fair specimen of the older methods of operating, and one from which the best results accrued. One of the great secrets of mesmeric success is indomitable perseverance, patience, and capacity for slow, plodding work. MR. COLQUHOUN'S MODE OF PROCEDURE This gentleman's method and explanations are exceedingly interesting. He says, â€œThe magnetic treatment is usually administered with the hand and is thence called manipulation. The usual method is to stroke repeatedly with the palms of the hands and fingers in one direction downwards from the head to the feet; and in returning to throw the hands round in a semi-circle, running the palms out side in order not to disturb the effects of the direct stroke. To magnetize in the contrary direction that is from the feet upward towards the head not only counteracts the effects of the former method, but frequently operates of itself prejudicially, especially in the case of irritable subjects. If we attempt to operate with the back of the hands, no effect whatever will probably be produced upon the patient.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of mesmeric success requires patience, perseverance, and the capacity for slow and plodding work. While manipulation is usually administered with the hand and is accompanied by either strong or light contact, the best results have been produced by passes at distance and by light contact. It is important to avoid nervous irritation and cerebral activity to achieve the desired results in producing sleep, alleviating pain, or curing disease."
