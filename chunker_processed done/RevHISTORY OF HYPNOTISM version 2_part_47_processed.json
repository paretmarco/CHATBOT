  "content": "The healing work with the Chi has many points in common with the magnetic practice. Also the Chinese Taoist alchemy is derived, and in turn has influenced the Indian alchemy, where alchemy is to be intended not only as a science for working with metals (and in the spagyric form to find healing remedies), but also as a wholistic science to work on the human being, symbolized by a stone to be purified. And to do it, energy, in the form, of consciousness, is necessary. The writer of the article, \"Mesmerism,\" in the work, \" The Occult Sciences \" —extracted from the \"Encyclopedia Metropolitana \" —after reverting to these and other writers on the subject, observes: \" The power of magnetism, either theoretically or practically, was never wholly unknown. In Asia and China it. has probably never ceased to be practiced from the earliest antiquity down to the present hour, and in the former vast region of population its use has been varied by that of drugs and narcotics. \" It is, then, an actual power that we ascribe to the hand, without which it could never have become the symbol of power among the ancients.",
