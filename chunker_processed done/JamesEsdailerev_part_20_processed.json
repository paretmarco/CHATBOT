  "title": "Understanding Somnambulism: Hypnotic States and Their Benefits",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of somnambulism in hypnosis, and the tests used to prove its existence. Amnesia is one such test, while ancient magnetists relied on the client’s response to a direct question. To achieve somnambulism through suggestions, the words must be understood by the client's subconscious mind, which is easier in the Esdaile state, also known as \"hypnotic coma\". The subject is deeply relaxed, and their muscles are at rest, but their subconscious is still listening and responding.",
  "content": "In fact, if somnambulism has been achieved through the help of suggestions from a state where the subject was wide awake and alert, the words had to be understood. But for understanding words the conscious of the client might be still alert even in light somnambulistic states and therefore be able to filter (if only poorly) the suggestions given to the subconscious, possibly taking control again in case of commands spoken out by the operator. Somnambulism and the Esdaile state Behind somnambulism, or as a deep somnambulism, lies the Esdaile state, this state is also called “hypnotic coma”, a state of mind that is very deep and is most of the time very useful for therapeutic sessions if used, a state of mind where the subject will not respond to questions given by the operator because the muscles rest, though his subconscious will still be listening and carrying out suggestions with some delay.",
