  "title": "\"The Philosophers' Geometry: Understanding Alchemical Symbols\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this book, we will explore the graphic forms that encourage critical thinking, focusing on the analysis of alchemical symbols that hold the key to hermeticism. The author delves into the concept of Philosophers' Geometry, which consisted of linking ideas to shapes and interpreting symbols composed of lines in the same way that geometers read figures. The author emphasizes that the first matter of the great art, the pure idea undistorted by words, has to be extracted from oneself. This is why hermetists were reticent to speak of transforming lead into gold, and instead, the recipes of the adept had to be followed to the letter.",
  "content": "It is by toiling to give meaning to the simplest of motifs that the spirit is able to raise itself to the fundamental ideas of human intelligence. The spirit elevates itself thus with total independence, without anything being dictated to it, it will find of its own accord the meaning of a relatively simple sketch or graphic. That said, the things that we are able to discover for ourselves, by virtue of the autonomous workings of our own perception, take on a guise of truth, at least in relation to ourselves. The value we assign to a symbol is true, for us, and if we are faithful to it, by assigning other values to other signs, we are constructing correctly, like good speculative masons. The first matter of the great art, that is, the pure idea, undistorted by words, has to be extracted from its mine – that is, from our own selves, from that famous pool wherein the truth hides. Hermetists in the Middle Ages were reticent in speaking of the processes required to transform lead into gold. It was safer if the layman – and above all the Inquisitors - believed that the recipes of the adept had to be followed to the letter.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of extracting pure ideas from within oneself and assigning personal value to symbols is crucial in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. While ancient alchemists may have obscured their methods, their fervent exploration of the world around them proved to be instrumental in the development of modern science. By following in their footsteps, we too can uncover the truths that lie within, and construct a better understanding of the world through our own unique perspectives."
