  "title": "\"The Plumb Line: Symbolism and Significance in Masonry\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves deeper into the symbolism of the plumb line in alchemical painting and its relation to the need for introspection and self-discovery. The editor of Vrijmetselaar makes a unique observation about the plumb line that points to the importance of self-examination and going deeper into one's being. The text further explains how Nature reveals its secrets and why Tritons confer foresight onto strong souls. The concept of fundamental unity in the identity of everything is highlighted as the endpoint of self-knowledge.",
  "content": "He acknowledges that we have provided a hitherto unheard-of interpretation of that plumb line by linking it to the need to descend into oneself and penetrate to the centre from which the inner light springs, the same light which according to the Gospel of Saint John illuminates every man who comes into this world. In fact, none of the authors who write about masonic symbolism consider the plumbline in any other way than as a tool of the art of construction. They have decided, consequently, that it is the tool for construction at height, without observing that it also works for depths. The plumb line in the alchemical painting alludes to the depth of a vertical pool, that goes down to the belly of the Earth. It is suspended over the head of the adept, who has to withdraw inside himself in order to reach the core of his being, where he will uncover the quintessential mystery that is the essence of his true self, freed from all contingencies of form. “Know thyself”, the plumbline says, because whoever learns, like Socrates, to really know himself will learn to see the fundamental Unity in the identity of Everything.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the plumbline serves as a powerful symbol for self-discovery, inner peace, and a sense of unity with the universe. By looking deeper into its representation as a tool that works in depths as well as heights, we can gain a greater understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Through self-knowledge and a connection to the universal whole, we can build the foundation for a solid and fulfilling life."
