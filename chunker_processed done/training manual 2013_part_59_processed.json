  "title": "The Dualistic Nature of the Mind in Understanding Psychoneurosis.",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author discusses how a worldwide ecological crisis is mirrored in our individual psychoneurosis. He also highlights the duality within us - the primal or animal mind, and the external, rationalized mind. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves more into the nature of the external mind or the 'civilized mind', how it is developed, and its relationship with the primal mind. They also explain how the developed sense of the mind is a tool, helping us choose, and how fear heightens this mechanism.",
  "content": "But the civilized mind doesn't rule the whole of the man, for example many times while we sleep or when we have sex, for example, it is absent. We could think of it as a product, a crystallization or condensation of some basic function of the mind. We spoke of our external minds as a defence mechanism. Mesmer noted that the more an animal has fear, the more he develop a sense. For example if we are in our home in the night and we hear a sound when we expect nobody to be there, we make our sense of hearing stronger and we bring there our attention. External mind is a tool, and it is made of senses, each one activated on a different level and is goal is to choose. And the more we have fears the more we enter in this mechanism.",
  "last_phrase": "To fully harness the power of our minds, we must integrate our primal and civilized minds and overcome the division between inner and outer reality. By understanding the function and purpose of our external mind, we can use our senses as tools to make informed choices and navigate our fears, while expressing ourselves fully and tapping into our basic energy. Remember that the first rule of magnetism is to unite our inner and outer selves for a truly cohesive and empowered existence."
