  "title": "The Illusion of One Observer and Multiple Perception of Reality",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of multiple observers/knowers and their limited perception of reality in different \"portholes\" or viewpoints. The illusion of one stable, unchanging knower/observer can lead to resistance and trauma. In psychotherapy, integrating different parts of ourselves into one unified whole assumes that each part has limited knowledge. Each knower/observer can only observe and know its particular perception and experience. This illusion challenges traditional assumptions about knowing and calls for a new understanding of the self.",
  "content": "In psychotherapy for example, we can understand that there are different parts of ourselves with different perceptions and experiences. Obviously, a little girl/boy part of ourselves wants different things than an adult part of ourselves. The attempt by psychotherapy to integrate all of the parts into one unified whole is a basic assumption that causes trauma. Each part of ourselves has a different knower/observer of the part and hence has limited knowledge. This means that the knower/observer of, \"I like myself' only knows that knowledge called \"I like myself.\" A different knower/observer knows and observes \"I don't like myself.\" With the confines of the knower/know (\"I like myself') there is no knowledge of \"I don't like myself.\" Likewise the knower that has the knowledge of \"I don't like myself' has only the \"I don't like myself knowledge\", not the \"I like myself' knowledge. This is why a knower of \"I like myself' cannot know the knowing of \"I don't like myself,\" and the knower of \"I don't like myself' cannot know \"I like myself.\"",
  "last_phrase": "For this reason, it's essential to recognize that each part of ourselves has its own unique perspective and limitations. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves and our experiences, we must move beyond the limited knowledge of individual observers and knowers and access pure knowing that transcends objects. With this approach, we can integrate all parts of ourselves without causing further trauma and create a more unified and holistic understanding of ourselves."
