  "title": "Therapeutic Session: Finding Power in Emptiness",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the session, the therapist guides the client through a process of confronting and releasing their feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, and over-giving. The therapist encourages the client to enter into an empty space where they can observe these identities from a distance. From this vantage point, the client realizes that the power they were seeking is inside themselves, rather than outside. This Tao of Chaos session is a powerful illustration of how therapy can help individuals overcome their inner struggles and find strength within themselves.",
  "content": "Therapist: How does the empty space feel as you enter into it? Client: Quiet, calm, kind of void. Therapist: Be \"back there\" in the empty space and look out at the two I-dentities of worthlessness and over-giver and the helplessness between them. How do they seem to you? THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 179 Client: I feel much less attached to them. Therapist: From \"back there\", ask the over-giver, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: To be recognized and acknowledged. Therapist: If the I-dentity felt recognized and acknowledged, what would that feel like? Client: Powerful. Therapist: Ask the worthlessness, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: To feel safe and strong. Therapist: And if the I-dentity felt safe and strong, how would that feel? Client: Powerful. Therapist: Feel the power of the empty space \"back there.\" Client: Yes. Therapist: Now, turn the I-dentities around so that they can see that the power they were seeking is inside the emptiness rather than facing toward the outside.",
  "last_phrase": "By exploring the emptiness inside us, we uncover the power that we were seeking outside. Recognizing and acknowledging ourselves can give us the strength and safety we desire, ultimately leading to a calm and powerful state of being."
