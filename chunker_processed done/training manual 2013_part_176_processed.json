  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we read about six exercises that can help individuals achieve greater physical and mental harmony. Now in the final 200 tokens, we learn about an optional seventh exercise that involves focusing on the breath and the inner self. By forgetting all language and external stimuli, individuals can experience a powerful inner charm, followed by a soothing light that illuminates the mind and heart. The text then recommends stretching, sponging, and dressing before the exercise, which involves placing both hands flat in a milkpan.",
  "content": "You will feel a degree of grandeur no tongue or language will ever be able to express. Still on and on you will continue to go on this plane of eternal progression to which there is no end. EXERCISE SEVENTH (optional) You will find it most advisable when you wake up to stretch your body for a few seconds, air your body, sponge it with tepid water or cold, then rub it vigorously with your hands, breathing well at all times. Then dress, wash and get ready for this exercise, unless you have other simple ones you wish to go through, although you know you cannot take many exercises in succession, that you must distribute them the best you can during the day, although you may take two exercises together that will suit your peculiar temperament. Procure a milkpan for 6 or 8 cents, large enough to place both of your hands flat in the dish.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating this simple exercise routine into your daily life can enhance your sense of grandeur and boost your physical well-being. Remember to take it slow, distribute exercises throughout the day and keep in mind the wrist bone and cent placement while performing this specific exercise for optimal results."
