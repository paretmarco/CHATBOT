  "title": "Therapeutic Process of Exploring Grief through Empty Space",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the therapy session continues with the client exploring her grief and utilizing techniques for processing her emotions. The therapist guides her through different experiences and sensations, including a layer of unconsciousness and an empty space, ultimately helping her find a feeling of peace and calm. This is a continuation of the therapy session with Barbara, who experiences trances of confusion and numbness as protection against her biological grief. Through this session, she begins to process her emotions and access a deeper level of understanding.",
  "content": "Client: I feel like I have a hole in my heart. Therapist: Peel back the hole and what is there? Client: I feel like going to sleep. Therapist: Create the feeling of sleep as a very slow moving energy and merge with that energy. Client: Okay. Therapeutic Note Here we have a layer of unconsciousness (sleep) that stands in front of the passageway to Essence and which is representative of the #9 fixation of attention. Therapist: How do you feel right now? Client: Relaxed but present. Therapist: Peel back the relaxed feeling and tell me what is there. Client: Empty space. Therapist: Enter into the empty space and tell me what you feel. Client: Peaceful, calm, like I'm home. Therapist: Now, move forward and feel the grief. (once again she sobs for a few minutes) Therapist: Now, move back into the emptiness. Client: That feels better. Therapist: Now move into the grief. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now move back into the emptiness. Client: Okay. Therapist: How are you doing?",
  "last_phrase": "Homework: Practice gently moving between the empty space and the feeling of grief until you feel comfortable experiencing it. If it becomes too intense, return to emptiness. Remember, progress takes time and patience."
