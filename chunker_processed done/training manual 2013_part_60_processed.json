  "title": "\"The Primitive Mind: Understanding Magnetism Beyond Civilization\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the duality of the human mind and how it affects our perception of reality. As we previously saw, the external mind is composed of our senses, each one activated on a different level, and its goal is to choose. The more we have fears, the stronger our sense of hearing, for example, becomes. In this last part, the author emphasizes the importance of overcoming the artificial split between inner and outer reality and embracing the primal mind's fluid nature, which is a complete expression of basic energy. The text concludes with the first rule in magnetism, as explained by Deleuze, which emphasizes the importance of understanding that energy is in us and around us.",
  "content": "The mechanism of our civilized mind is in fact dualistic, and it is based on choice, and choice is based on two basic forces: active/fighting, and therefore aggressivity, and passive/flight, and therefore submission. The primal mind is instead different. Its goal instead is expressing itself in a complete way and on different planes. Its nature is more fluid, and expression of a basic energy. FIRST RULE IN MAGNETISM: we must overcome the artificial split from inner and outer reality. Energy is in us and around us. As Deleuze said: As we cannot comprehend how a body can act upon another at a distance, without there being something to establish a communication between them, we suppose that a substance emanates from him who magnetizes, and is conveyed to the person magnetized, in the direction given it by the will.",
  "last_phrase": "To fully understand and harness the power of magnetism, we must first overcome the artificial split between our inner and outer reality. By embracing our primal state and recognizing the fluid nature of energy, we can tap into the magnetic fluid that is present in and around us. Let us not allow the constraints of civilization and the civilized mind to hinder our exploration of this powerful force."
