The author also mentions the importance of formulating clear intentions and having strong mental energy. The text concludes with a suggestion for using this ability to obtain a service or object from someone who is resistant to parting with it.

  "content": "The chosen person will soon become restless, nervous, as if she was aware of a force that dominates her, and will end up looking on your side or even staring at you. 5Â° Get to the window and look at a person who comes towards you.

The experience can be done with the same process in backward conditions; namely, passing you set one person at a window. Two action elements come into the scene in this series of experiences: the magnetic power of gaze and the concentration of thought. When these experiences have succeeded once on two, you have conscience that you can dominate others and impose your will in large measure.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of gaze and concentration of thought can be used to dominate others and influence their actions. By practicing these techniques, you can become more aware of your ability to impose your will on others. However, it is important to use this power ethically and responsibly, taking into consideration the impact it may have on those around you."
