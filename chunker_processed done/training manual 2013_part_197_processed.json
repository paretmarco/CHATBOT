  "title": "\"The Fascinator: Unveiling the Origins of Ancient Gazing Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we were introduced to the mysterious figure of Virgilio T. who holds ancient secrets of a school on the power of gaze. Through a series of meetings, he initiated the author and his friend Max into the arcane exercises. This final part delves into Virgilio T.'s demonstration of the power of gaze, where he successfully hypnotized two customers at his barber shop, leaving them in a state of daze.",
  "content": "Once he received a positive reply to his said request, he closed the door of the shop and firmly fized his gaze on one of the customers, who had moreover assumed a somewhat defiant look. His defiant posturing only lasted for a very short period. Within a few seconds, in fact, that customer took on a livid appearance. Virgilio told him that the cigarette was bad. The customer thus addressed began to cough so much that Virgilio was forced to slap him in the face a few times in order to bring him back to his senses. When it came to the second customer, he did not even utter a single word to him. He fixed him closely, and this other customerâ€™s look turned pallid and diaphanous as if it was made of wax.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio's abilities to affect people's physical and mental states, and his sensitivity to energies, demonstrate the power of the human mind and its potential for extraordinary feats. It is a reminder to us all to explore the limits of our own abilities and unlock our true potential."
