  "title": "\"The Power of Positive Imagination: Steps to Achieving Visualization\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the transformative power of imagination and how we can use it to our advantage. We explore the two phases of imagination - passive and positive trance - and the importance of not getting stuck in the former. We discuss the concept of the Hermetic Caduceus and how imagination can help us bring our dreams to life. Moreover, we learn how imagination can affect not only ourselves but also those around us, and how energy exercises can further enhance this connection. The text emphasizes the need for patience, practice, and perseverance in developing this skill.",
  "content": "• Remember that the images you create are totalling, in other words, when we speak of “imagination”, we mean something that is both visually and aurally, both tangible and perceptible. It takes time to achieve at maximum degree the ability to shape our mental material as clay, but the results are worth the effort. You will notice an increase in personal influence, and you'll realize that often the person beside you feel the same emotions you do. This phenomenon of \"correlation\" (to use a quantum term) binds fascination too, or rather the connection to another person through the eyes. With this type of direct technique an imagination of heat in one hand reflects in the person who looks at us, a feeling of scratchiness equally, and so forth. However, if this has to happen without talking, in excess of having a very much evolved imagination, you must accompany it with energy exercises. But these are results of «top school».",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing strong visualization skills takes time and effort, but the results are worth it. Through this direct technique, you can connect with others and increase your personal influence. To enhance the effectiveness of using mental images, it's recommended to also practice energy exercises. Remember to observe images lit by reflection and use light sources to enhance the symbols that you focus on for a stronger retentive memory. Keep practicing and you'll unlock the full potential of your imagination."
