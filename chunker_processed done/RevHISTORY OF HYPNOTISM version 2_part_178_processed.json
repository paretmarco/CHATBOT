  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author presented authentic instances of abnormal states in which people exhibited extraordinary faculties such as seeing through opaque bodies or feeling no pain. The annals of religious bodies also provided many examples of similar states. The last 200 tokens present the topic of healing, where there were many accounts of people successfully using the laying on of hands with the intention of curing. The author mentions the examples of successful healer Valentine Greatrakes, whose cures were well authenticated. The text explores how the fame and reputation of healers, like Greatrakes, were influenced by their social status.",
  "content": "Valentine Greatrakes Most of these healers had only a local fame, being poor and illiterate, but some of them had national reputations, and the most frequently mentioned of them all is Greatrakes, who lived some four hundred and fifty years ago90, and who happened to be a man of fortune, and to have been known in fashionable circles. He was undoubtedly a wonderful operator, but it is probable that had he been a poor cobbler or gardener. In a similar way to some of those healers, his fame would not have gone beyond his own neighborhood. Greatrakes is a valuable instance in point, not only because he was a powerful healer, but because his cures were so well authenticated.91 For instance, the Bishop of Derry of that time (Dr. George Rust) wrote of Greatrakes:- \"I was three weeks together with him at my Lord Conway's, and saw him, I think, lay his hand upon a thousand persons; and really there is something more than ordinary in it; but I am convinced it is not something miraculous.",
  "last_phrase": "Greatrakes may have lived 450 years ago, but his legacy as a powerful healer still lives on. His well-documented cures of various ailments prove that miraculous powers were not his only gift, but rather his amazing ability to heal was a product of hard work and dedication to his craft. His success story serves as an example of how a person's socioeconomic status should not limit their potential to help others."
