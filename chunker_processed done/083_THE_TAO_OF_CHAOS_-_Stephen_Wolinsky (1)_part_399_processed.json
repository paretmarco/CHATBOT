  "title": "\"The Unity of Mind and Body: Exploring Perception and Movement in the Nervous System\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author challenges the traditional belief that our brains contain representations of the external material world. He argues that perception is not simply an internal model but a learned organization between our brain and the world. He also notes that mental functions cannot be separated from motor functions and that observing how we organize ourselves to act in the world can reveal the interrelatedness between movement and perception. These points are crucial to understanding the more complex matters explored in Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "We are sailing here between two conflicting philosophies: that of idealism and solipsism, that our minds create reality, and realism, that our brains contain representations of a real external material world. There is one further split to confront. And that is the notion that what we call mind and psyche is one realm and what we refer to as body is another. Earlier in this essay I suggested that the organization of movement and the organization of perception were interrelated events in the nervous system, that they arise simultaneously. From the perspective of the Feldenkrais work, where there is an emphasis on observing how one organizes oneself to act and function in the world, one begins to notice that what we call mental functions are never separate from motor functions. Careful self observation will reveal, for example, that when picturing an object in one's mind's eye with the eyes closed, there is the appearance of tension in the muscles of the eye. Similarly with emotional events, there is a perceived state of the motor system that accompanies what we call the emotion. We can see and recognize the motor attitude of a person and guess as to what that person is feeling.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the idea of a separation between mind and body is a fallacy. The concept of soma, which recognizes the unity of mental and motor functions, is more accurate. Through self-observation and mindfulness, we can gain knowledge about ourselves and better understand the embodied nature of our being."
