  "title": "\"What Preparations are Required to Conduct Effective Magnetic Magic Experiments Successfully?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the precautions and techniques required for conducting experiments involving magical signs and seers. The author advises being quick and prompt in decision-making and keeping emotions under control to prevent overflow. He suggests having an opaque cover to hide the sign in case of need, as sometimes the fright and emotions can become too intense for the seer to handle. In the last 200 tokens, the author notes his own unease during these experiments, highlighting the increased level of vital forces that organ resistance can offer. The author stresses the importance of understanding that magical effects are equally successful without the use of ceremonies, drugs, or incense, but that those who can utilize them often rely on weak and diseased imaginations. This text delves into the fascinating realm of the magical and the importance of taking necessary precautions to conduct such experiments safely.",
  "content": "That which is here beheld, surpasses by far that which shows itself, in the nervous affections that may be caused by a disease of the brain or organic disorder. Do not allow yourself to be taken with the charm the Seer sometimes experiences. The flattering things he beholds lasts but for a few moments, and they are soon replaced by sudden terrors. In successful experiments the effects are sometimes laughable, and at other times very serious, because the Subject often falls down insensible. I do not know whether the things called Magical possess the force that is attributed to them, for these experiments are, without regard to ceremonies, equally successful, although they are performed without a prayer, without drugs and incense, and in any place whatever. I believe that those who make use of such means know the letter, without knowing the things themselves (\"spirit\"), and can only act upon weak and diseased imaginations. . . . I experience, without doubt, a certain quaking in my being; I can say that I feel in me something unusual.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the effects of magical practices may seem enticing and captivating, it is important to approach them with caution and skepticism. As seen in these experiments, the results can be unpredictable and even dangerous. Rather than relying on external means, it is wise to focus on developing a strong and healthy mind, free from weakened and diseased imaginations, in order to achieve lasting and meaningful results."
