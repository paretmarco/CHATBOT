  "title": "\"The Primal State: Connection, Magnetism, and Civilized Mind\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the first part of the text, the author explains the duality of the civilized mind and the primal mind. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the idea of the primal state and the connection between individuals within a group. They suggest that the civilized mind may block our understanding of magnetism and that the primal state is characterized by group consciousness. The author references Deleuze's concept of \"magnetic fluid\" to explain the means of employing magnetism.",
  "content": "This substance, which sustains life in us, we call the magnetic fluid, The nature of this fluid is unknown; even its existence has not been demonstrated ; but everything occurs as if itdid exist, and that warrants us in admitting it, while we are indicating the means of employing magnetism 2. Primal States and connection Our idea is that there is a state in man that we can call \"primal state\" or \"primality\". This is an unborn state and it is the state that man had before civilization. For 90 000 years of human evolution human existed but they had no civilization as we intend today. Is civilization and the civilized mind something that blocks us from understanding magnetism? GROUP CONNECTION Even without civilization, human have always existed in groups. The primal state where the civilized mind is not present is as a particular state characterized by group and interpersonal relationship more than by personal relationship. There is consciousness, but its manifestation is connected to the manifestation of the group.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the nature of the magnetic fluid remains unknown, the use of magnetism has been warranted based on the way it behaves as if it exists. Moreover, the concept of the primal state, with its emphasis on group connection and absence of ego, offers a compelling alternative to the limitations of civilization and its impact on our understanding of concepts such as magnetism. Perhaps we should look back to our origins and explore how we can incorporate these ideas into our lives."
