  "title": "\"The Healing Power of Mesmerism in Medical Cases\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Esdaile discusses the importance of Mesmerism in treating various medical conditions. He highlights its ability to instantly alleviate nervous pains, arrest convulsions, and even aid in the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, he notes that Mesmerism can be used as a general tonic for diseases of debility, particularly in disorders of the nervous system. In this final section, Esdaile emphasizes the benefits of Mesmeric sleep, which simulates natural sleep but provides a more refreshing experience, without the negative side effects of common narcotics. The author highlights how Mesmerism's ability to stimulate the nervous system can be beneficial for patients even when sleep or coma isn't induced.",
  "content": "Of the sleep he writes:- \"Mesmeric sleep simulates perfectly sound natural sleep, and is more refreshing even if it has been resorted to for soothing pain or disturbance of the system, and can be had recourse to when it would be improper or useless to administer common narcotics, over which it has the advantage of not inducing a disagreable constitutional derangement after the specific influence has ceased. The restorative power of mesmeric sleep seems to depend upon an animal infusion of nervous vigour into the body, and when induced is a remedial agent; this may account for its superiority over common sleep.\" Of the good effect of Mesmerism, when no sleep or coma is produced, Esdaile says:- \"The refreshment from sleep, often not otherwise to be procured, and the sedative influence of the trance would alone constitute Mesmerism a valuable medical agent. But it is from its power of stimulating the nervous system that a patient often draws the greatest benefit when all other remedies have failed, and to procure this effect neither sleep nor coma is usually necessary.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism can be a valuable medical agent for patients who have failed to get relief from other remedies. This technique offers a sedative influence on the nervous system that can result in the refreshment of sleep or the stimulation of nervous vigour. It is a powerful tool that can be used safely for patients who may not be able to tolerate common narcotics but need relief from pain and other disturbs of the system."
