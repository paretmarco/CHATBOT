  "title": "The Power of Light: Understanding and Utilizing Its Benefits",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discussed the ancient practice of sun gazing and its benefits for physical, mental, and spiritual health. In this last part, we focus on the incredible power of light in increasing psychological ability, based on the findings of Dr. Lefebvre. However, looking directly at the sun can cause eye damage, so we recommend using artificial light instead. It is essential to understand the physics of light to comprehend its power fully. We learn how the white light of the sun splits into its component rays, creating what is known as the solar spectrum.",
  "content": "Follow these specifics: max 75 watt Stay at least at 2 m of distance no more than 30 seconds of observations Do not use it in case of maculopathy or other problems (check with your physician) Remember: the key to getting cerebral effects is not the direct light, but the paraluminous trace that you will experience with closed eyes (the afterimage of light - the light in the darkness) Why is light so important? In order to understand the power of light it is necessary to know something about the physics of light. If we cause the white light of the sun or of the electric arc-light to fall through a prism, the result is a splitting up of the light into its component rays. Technically the arrangement of the component rays of white light is known as the solar spectrum.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember, the key to experiencing the cerebral effects of light is not by directly staring at it, but by observing the paraluminous trace with closed eyes. Follow the specific guidelines and precautions to safely use light therapy. Understanding the physics of light helps to appreciate its power, and both clinical and spectroscopic observations confirm its therapeutic attributes."
