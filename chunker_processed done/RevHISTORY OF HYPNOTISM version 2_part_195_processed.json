  "title": "\"Magnetism and the Influence of Deleuze in the Academic Field\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the influence of Deleuze in the academic field and the growth of magnetism after 1820 are discussed. After the publication of \"Histoire Critique du Magnetisme,\" prominent scientific figures, including Ampere, Laplace, and Cuvier, examined facts supporting animal magnetism. In 1820, the second commission was established due to significant evidence and the adoption of magnetism in other nations. By 1825, even skeptics were ashamed of the Royal Commissioners' report and a small committee was appointed to examine magnetism. This section provides context for the growth of magnetism and the recognition it received from eminent figures.",
  "content": "Furthermore, the opinions expressed in favour of animal magnetism by Ampere, Laplace, Cuvier, and other men of equal eminence, whose names ought to have silenced the voice of factious skepticism, induced many who were previously indifferent to investigate the subject. Magnetism after 1820 “Magnetism involves no profession of philosophical faith” Teste The second commission, which revalued magnetism, was therefore mainly established in 1820 due to numerous examples of evidence, and even to the fact that other nations had embraced magnetism. Even the enemies of Magnetism were starting to be ashamed of the report of the Royal Commissioners of 1784; it was in 1825 that Dr. Foissac proposed to the Academy of Medicine the examination of the whole subject again; and a small Committee of the members was appointed to look into the matter generally, and to report whether another formal examination by the Academy was advisable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the revaluation of animal magnetism in the 19th century was a result of the growing acceptance and recognition by influential scientists, even those who were initially skeptical. The continuous examination and re-examination of the subject proved that no decision in science is absolute and irrevocable. As such, it is always prudent to approach subjects with an open mind and investigate them de novo, especially when new evidence or advancements in the field come to light."
