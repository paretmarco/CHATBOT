  "title": "The Enteric Nervous System: A Mini-Brain for Gut Control",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the fascinating role of the enteric nervous system, a clump of tissue that forms early in embryo genesis and largely functions independently, controlling the gut's hundred million neurons. Now, we explore the notion that the enteric brain, situated in the solar plexus and regarded as the seat of the subconscious, maintains man's contact with the ocean of universal life and the cosmos, allowing for a fundamental connection that the upper brain cannot achieve. The question arises: which sense is most crucial in feeling that we have understood?",
  "content": "Rather than crowding the hundred million neurons required for control of the gut into the cranial cavity as part of the cephalic brain, and transmitting signals over long-unreliable pathways, natural selection placed the integrative microcircuits at the site of the effectors.\" (Wood, 1994, p. 424) The Seat of Subconscious With the development of the brain man attained the self-awareness which enabled him to become an individual. The goal of the upper brain is finding a way to solve everyday’s needs. The enteric brain whose main activating point is the solar plexus, by contrast, being the seat of the subconscious, maintains man's contact with the ocean of universal life, with the whole cosmos, and this is something the brain cannot do. A Fundamental Point for connecting to the cosmos When we want to know if something is clear in the mind of somebody, we ask if that “makes sense”. But which sense is the most important to feel that we have understood?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enteric brain or the \"second brain\" located in the gut is not just responsible for digestion and gut functions, but it also serves as the seat of the subconscious, providing a crucial point of connection to the cosmos. To truly understand and experience something, it is essential to connect with the solar plexus and the Hara center, and sense it with every fiber of one's being. This way of knowing goes beyond just intellectual understanding and is necessary for a deeper sense of comprehension."
