  "title": "\"The Healing Power of Mesmerism in Various Diseases\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author highlights the various medical benefits of mesmeric processes that go beyond just treating nervous disorders. The author shares the success stories of Dr. Hitchman, who claimed mesmeric processes could cure cancer, as well as their own experience in using it to alleviate several other illnesses. The author believes that there is hardly any form of a disease that cannot be relieved through mesmeric processes. They also note that various modes of local mesmeric treatment, such as massage or kinetic movements, are just different ways of applying it. The author wraps up by acknowledging that although they believe the success of mesmeric processes is due to animal magnetism, others attribute it to skilled manipulation.",
  "content": "Although I cannot record the cure of cancer, like Dr. Elliotson or Dr. Hitchman, or absolute cures of total blindness like Dr. Mack, my pretty wide and general experience enables me to declare my undoubted conviction, that there is scarcely any form of disease which may not be at least relieved where Hot cured, by the steady, persevering, and judicious use of the mesmeric processes. Massage, shampooing, muscular and kinetic movements are but different modes of local mesmeric treatment. These terms are more fashionable in some quarters than the word Mesmerism-that is of little consequence, if good is done. Some years ago I applied local Mesmerism to the cure of “writer's cramp,” and ailments of that class, with great success. The manipulations and directions seemed to cure the most obstinate cases. Personally, I attributed the success to Animal Magnetism; but not a few medical men attributed the success to deftness of direction and power of manipulation, which might be termed “tactus eraditus”, in plain English “knock.” There is no secret about it and yet I admit it is not easily taught.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, although Mesmerism may not be a widely recognized practice in modern medicine, the steady and judicious use of the mesmeric processes such as massage, combined with local gymnastics, can offer relief and even cure a variety of ailments. The success of such techniques is not attributed to any secret knowledge or power, but rather to deftness of direction and power of manipulation. Those suffering from disease, regardless of their prior skepticism towards Mesmerism, have been known to seek the comfort of its curative influence."
