  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, two breathing exercises were mentioned to achieve relaxation and focus. Now, a third exercise is presented, which is not essential for magnetizing, but it is included for the sake of completeness. Exercise three aims to strengthen the larynx and improve the clarity and melody of the voice. It is important to take a firm position and keep the tongue relaxed in the lower part of the mouth to facilitate the passage of air. In addition, teeth should be separated to allow for easier breathing. These exercises, along with the previous ones, can help in maintaining overall well-being.",
  "content": "After you have become accustomed to the balancing of the body forward and backward, take several steps while inhaling, then while taking a few more steps learn to retain breath for just a few seconds. You will soon find that after a little practice this exercise will prove of inestimable value. EXERCISE THREE NOTE: this exercise is not necessary for magnetizing, but we put it here for sake of fullness Take the same position as in the first exercise. Always be certain you take a firm position and that your teeth are separated, the tongue resting in a perfectly relaxed condition in the lower part of the mouth. Not that your tongue needs the much desired rest, but so the air you inhale can more readily pass through the air tube. It will also help to strengthen the larynx, and you will find that even your voice becomes clearer and more melodious after a few exercises.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing this exercise regularly can help you achieve a better balance and even improve the quality of your voice. While it is not necessary for magnetism, it may prove to be of great value in the long run. Remember to focus on the object in front of you, but not on its value, as sense is the ultimate goal, not money."
