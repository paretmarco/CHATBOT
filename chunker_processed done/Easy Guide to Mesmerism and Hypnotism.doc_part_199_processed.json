  "title": "Chaos and Order: An Account of a Turbulent Event",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author described a chaotic scene where poor subjects were posed in various attitudes by the students for medical demonstrations, while the audience was indignant with their conduct. In this part of the text, the author is determined to take control of the situation despite the difficulties. The author uses a pianist to drown the noise by his music, but then signals him to give his arms and fingers a rest. The author walks up and down the platform to arrest the audience's attention and suddenly faces them, lifting their right hand and standing still. This action reduces the student's songs to gusts, and the audience is curious about what the author is going to do next.",
  "content": "I signalled to him to let the poor piano alone, and give his arms and fingers a rest, I walked up and down the platform as if about to do something—a habit which I had when I wished particularly to arrest the attention of an audience—and then suddenly faced the audience, and lifted my right hand and stood still. The major portion of the audience looked toward the platform. “Rule Britannia” and “Old John Brown” of the students were now reduced to fitful gusts. The element of curiosity had now slightly got ahead of “dominant idea of having a good night's fun.” What's he going to do now? Became the undercurrent idea.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the speaker gained the attention of the audience and shared a captivating anecdote. The audience's initial intent to have a good time was overshadowed by curiosity, and the speaker took advantage of this to share an interesting story. This goes to show that sometimes, a simple change in approach can make all the difference in capturing the attention of an audience."
