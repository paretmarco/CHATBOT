  "title": "\"The Significance of Color and Symbolism in Masonic Initiation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the symbolism of the colors used in a Masonic Lodge and their representation in the different stages of initiation. The first grade Lodge is decorated in blue to represent the boundless Universe, while the Chamber of the Companion has a red ceiling that symbolizes an individual's sphere of activity. The author highlights that becoming enlightened requires the vestal virgin to an internal fire, which must be kept alive through communication and communion with the collective forces. The final 200 tokens describe the importance of external action for companions and workers, but also the need to call upon mysterious forces found in Column B, which is named as \"the force is in him.\"",
  "content": "Indeed, it is important for the Son to be in communication with the Father, that the Interior communicates with the Exterior; in other words, that the individual enters into communion with the Collective from which he originates. Released with only our personal resources, we can only work on our own selves. This is also just what is asked of us as Apprentices. But once our rough Stone is scraped smooth, carved and cleaned up as the rules state, we no longer have to worry about our own self, which from the point of view of the purification of Salt, is how it should already be. But as soon as the instrument of action is perfected, we must act on that which is external to us, thus beginning the actual work, to which we dedicate ourselves as Workers or Companions. But whatever we might do in this stage would be insignificant: we must possess the secret ability to call upon forces outside ourselves. Whence might we absorb these mysterious forces? Could it not be at Column B., whose name means: ‘The force is in him’?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the path of an Apprentice requires individual work on our rough Stone until we become a perfected instrument of action. However, to truly make a meaningful impact, we must possess the secret ability to call upon forces outside ourselves. These mysterious forces can be found at Column B, where the Steel of the Sages awaits to envelop us and ignite the higher virtues needed to accomplish the philosophical work."
