  "first_phrase": "In this text, we will delve into mesmerism, a hypnosis technique developed by Franz Mesmer. We will focus on the practical application of mesmerism, which involves passing magnetic forces from the mesmerizer to the subject to create a balanced flow of fluid in the body. The last 200 tokens depict the specific steps to perform a mesmerism session, including hand gestures and placements. This technique was popular in the 18th century and attracted the attention of many notable figures, including King Louis XVI and the French writer Victor Hugo.",
  "content": "You will then place your hands above the head; you will keep them there for a moment, and you will bring them down, passing in front of the face, at the distance of one or two inches, as far as the pit of the stomach; there you will stop for about two minutes, placing your thumbs on the pit of the stomach and the other fingers below the ribs. Then you will descend slowly along the body as far as the knees, or better and if you can without incommoding yourself to the extremity of the feet. You will repeat the same process during the greater part of the sitting; you will also approach the patient sometimes, so as to place your hands behind his shoulders, and let them descend slowly along the spine to the back, and from thence on to the haunches and along the thighs so far as the knees, or even to the feet. After the first pass you may dispense with placing the hands on the head, and make the subsequent passes on the arm. If no results are produced in half-an-hour, the sitting terminates, and the foregoing process is repeated again.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it may seem slow and tedious, the key to success in magnetism treatment is perseverance, patience, and slow, plodding work. Follow the steps prescribed by Mr. Colquhoun, placing your hands over the patient's head and slowly descending along their body, and approaching the patient sometimes to place your hands behind their shoulders. With the right approach and enough time, the desired results will eventually be achieved."
