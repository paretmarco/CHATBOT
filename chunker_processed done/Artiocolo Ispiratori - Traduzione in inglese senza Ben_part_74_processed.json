  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how an intense look and a few gentle touches can rid someone of their cigarette addiction. Maurizio Ferrara claims that since undergoing this treatment, he \"really does not know what a cigarette is.\" The treatment involves touching areas of the body linked to smoking, such as the head, chest, and arms, and noticing an immediate decrease in the desire to smoke. Magnetic hypnosis is suggested as a possible explanation for the treatment's effectiveness, though willpower seen as an essential ingredient. In the following 200 words, the article will discuss the workings of magnetic hypnosis and the importance of willpower in successfully quitting smoking.",
  "content": "Using his hands, Advocate Campanelli touches those areas of the body which are linked to smoking: The head, which is the cradle of habit; the chest, which corresponds to emotionality; and the arms and hands, which represent gestural expressiveness. The important aspect of the treatment is to notice the immediate decrease of the desire to smoke. One might be tempted to think that all of that results from magnetic hypnosis, which is far more effective than its traditional counterpart wherein the patient is aware of being hypnotized. With magnetic hypnosis, therefore, the smoker is conditioned to reject the cigarette without realizing that. For the sake of a comprehensive treatment, will power ought to be added to hypnosis as a further ingredient: «A double force, given that, telepathically, I add my own will power to the patient’s. The one eager to quit smoking “feels” he is not alone. He feels I am present with him so as to lend him help. That is why he succeeds”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Enzo Campanelli's unique approach to smoking cessation using magnetic hypnosis and willpower, which he learned from his master Herman Michel, shows promising results in reducing the desire to smoke immediately. With proper guidance and support, smokers can overcome this dangerous illness, paving the way for a healthier and happier life."
