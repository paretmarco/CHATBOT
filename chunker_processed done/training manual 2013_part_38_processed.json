  "first_phrase": "This text emphasizes on the importance of breathing and how it affects physical conditions. Before introducing the last part of the text, the author mentions the significance of proper and deep breathing for removing distressing feelings and purifying blood. The last section entitled \"First Preparatory exercises\" introduces a series of exercises that can enhance human physical and mental conditions through the use of physical and mental light. Exercise 1 focuses on the use of white light and breathing to stimulate the upper part of the lungs, which is important for personal magnetism. The author reminds the readers to breathe fully and emphasizes that muscular chest expansion alone is not enough to prove large breath capacity.",
  "content": "We might then increase magnetism through the sagacious use of white light, whether in its direct or its reflected forms.7 It is possible to attain states of plenitude even without recourse to its actual physical use, but the path would then prove to be far more arduous, and it would in any event still pass through phases in which light appears in a mental form. - Look at a white light (maximum 75 watt bulb) for 20 '/ 30' seconds (light stimulates the optic nerve leading it to the highest degree of excitement) - Inhale and hold the breath while tensing the muscles of the arms and the forearms and clenched fists. After bend down (maintaining your breath while you bend over) - Get up while maintaining your breath. Relax your arms and release clenched fists slowly while exhaling equally slow. NOTE: this exercise stimulates the upper part of the lungs: this part of the lungs very important for personal magnetism Remember in most of these exercises: 1. Breathe always fully 2.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises that involve the use of light can help improve personal magnetism, concentration, and intuitive ability. The suggested exercises, such as looking at a white light or a black spot, can be done in a few simple steps and with regular practice, can lead to positive results. Remember to always breathe fully and consistently during the exercises for the best outcome."
