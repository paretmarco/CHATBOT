  "content": "This concept is thus sketched in practical terms by Wolfart, a German writer on magnetism, held in high reputation: \" All things in nature possess a particular power, which manifests itself by special actions upon other bodies—viz., a physico-dynamic power acting exteriorly, without chemical union, or without being introduced into the interior of the organization. Mesmer taught that all organic bodies, animals, trees, plants, and also stones, water, & c., might be impregnated with the magnetic fluid, and that this fluid might be propagated to considerable distances. It might be transmitted by direct contact with an already magnetized body, or by means of the hand, the look, or even the will. Like light and electricity, it could penetrate solid and fluid bodies, and it can be reflected by mirrors, or polished surfaces, especially in the direction of the poles.\" Man can get in touch with the universe Man’s way of getting into contact with the wholeness of the universe is through an ‘internal sense’ which is in reality a ‘union and interlacing’ of the external senses, a ‘wholistic sense’. We could call it intuition, but developed at its highest level.",
