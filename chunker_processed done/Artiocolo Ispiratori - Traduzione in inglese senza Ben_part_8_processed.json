  "title": "\"Unlocking the Healing Power of Magnetism in Pathologies\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves deeper into the techniques of magnetic healing and the various states that can be experienced through it. It gives an example of a person who overcame epileptic manifestations through these techniques and describes the specific states that can be attained such as magnetic ecstasy and magnetic sleep. It also discusses the roots of quantum science and animal magnetism in the philosophy of Schopenauer. The text concludes by stating that everyone can develop this force, even those who do not believe in it.",
  "content": "The first developer of quantum sciences were some german scientists (Bohr, Schroedinger etc…) deeply imbued with the philosophy of Schopenauer, and Schopenauer in turn had been deeply impressed by the experiences of animal magnetism he had observed. These experiences contributed to create the very basis of his philosophy. The force we are able to develop is no mere suggestion, inasmuch as the results which are obtained frequently defy any explanation, and through it problematic cases which had previously been entrusted to no avail to the care of doctors, specialists and other categories of hypnotists, are very often solved. Some people, for the sake of expressing this concept, use the term “personal power”, although no one has succeeded in codifying it precisely merely on the strength of external indicia. Although some people are naturally gifted in this sense, everyone can develop such force. Paradoxically, the capacity we are dealing with here is present even in persons or therapists who do not believe in magnetism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of personal power or magnetism is not limited to those who believe in animal magnetism or quantum sciences. It is a capacity that every individual possesses at varying levels, and with practice and self-discipline, can be developed to heal ourselves and others. By using our body as a departure point, we establish a direct connection to our physiological functions and emotions, making personal magnetism and healing possible."
