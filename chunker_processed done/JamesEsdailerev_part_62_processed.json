  "title": "\"Animal Magnetism and Hypnotic Anesthesia: Historical Perspectives\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, we learn about the history of anesthesia and its relation to animal magnetism. Before animal magnetism, all surgical operations were excruciatingly painful. But with magnetism, patients were able to undergo surgery without experiencing any pain. The use of anesthesia became widespread, and even painless cancer surgeries were conducted. This concept ties into two different complementary approaches: Mesmer's theory of a universal medium and the Puysegurean or Experimental School's theory of vital magnetism. These approaches believed that the human body could acquire an internal knowledge of its disorder and the remedies suitable to cure it.",
  "content": "The more the subject lets his mind free the better it is. Hypnotic Anesthesia At the beginning, anesthesia was seen just as a byproduct of magnetism and of no immediate value. But later with its use for surgical operations, anesthesia became widespread. Until insensibility to pain was produced by Animal Magnetism, every surgical operation was the infliction of torture, often of the most excruciating kind. But with animal magnetism, instead of the patient being strapped down immovably, while the surgeon did the best he could upon the writhing, struggling, screaming form, the magnetized patient placidly slept, or calmly conversed with a bystander, while a limb was amputated, or a tumour cut out. A case of the absolutely painless removal of a cancerous breast was one of the facts certified to in the Report of 1831; and, year after year, the perfectly authenticated record of painless operations in the magnetic state grew larger.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the development and use of anesthesia, particularly through the practice of animal magnetism, has revolutionized the medical field by allowing for painless surgical procedures. Despite initial skepticism and opposition, it is now widely accepted as an essential component of modern medicine, helping to alleviate suffering and improve patient recovery."
