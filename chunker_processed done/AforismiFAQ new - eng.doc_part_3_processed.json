  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we learn about the \"not knowing\" quality when operating magnetically, the power of thought energy, and the importance of welcoming the gifts that the Universe bestows on us. In this final section, we'll delve into aphorisms on the body and energy. We'll explore concepts such as the non-verbal nature of the body, the importance of being in touch with oneself, and how magnetism is born from a surplus of nervous potential. The text also includes quotes from Lao-Tse and Puysegur, as well as insights into the nature of reality and the power of belief.",
  "content": "If the universe gifts you something which you fail to acknowledge and you thus turn it down, it is by no means guaranteed that such gift will come back or that the universe is going to hand it to you in the form you prefer. Placing ourselves in the position of welcoming the gifts which the Universe bestows on us is the key. Magnetism is one of those gifts Believe and will (Puysegur) Do not bring thought into your being. Rather take it to reality. Aphorisms on the Body The density of words is lower than the density of gestures. The self is primarily verbal, whereas one's inward identity is primarily non-verbal. The body is non-verbal The more one is in touch with his own self, the greater is the ensuing state of balance going to be. Taking back possession of our body will lead us back to our own selves The non-verbal is denser than the verbal Whatever the mind truly wills will be done by the body Aphorisms on Energy Magnetism is born when you have something you know you can bring out. It is born when you have a surplus of nervous potential.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember to acknowledge and welcome the gifts that the Universe bestows upon us, as turning them down may mean they won't come back. Stay in touch with your own self and take back possession of your body to achieve balance. Magnetism is born out of a surplus of nervous potential, which is natural and links to vitality. Don't overthink, focus on doing and mastering your attention."
