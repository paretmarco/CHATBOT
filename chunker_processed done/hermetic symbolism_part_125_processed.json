  "title": "\"Hermetische Philosophie und Freimaurerei: A Selection of Alchemical Texts\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed a work by Weiss and Hameier which is a collection of texts from various renowned alchemists. These texts cover a wide range of topics, such as the universe, astrology, magic, Kabbalah, and alchemy. The last 200 tokens of our discussion touch upon the inherent difficulties of understanding initiatic symbols and reducing them to concrete definitions. The author emphasizes that the instrument of paradox lies in the word itself and that understanding the symbolic language requires contemplation and effort. The author also notes that Mr. HÃ¶hler's approach opens the door to a deeper inquiry into the connections between alchemical texts and masonic teachings.",
  "content": "This method could leave lazy minds perplexed, if they have never thought to search for the meaning of all the enigmas posed by freemasonry. On the other hand, his method does answer the requirements of thinkers, who, having no fear of the efforts of contemplation, prefer to be given the elements of a problem rather than a more or less dogmatically formulated solution. In the realm of symbolism there is no need to be overly precise, as the initiatic symbols correspond to concepts that by their nature are difficult to understand, and cannot be reduced to scholastic definitions. In the final analysis, such definitions lead to nothing but words, wholly spurious entities with which sophists like to play. The word is, essentially, the instrument of paradox. It is possible to defend any thesis by argument, which can demonstrate the pro just as triumphantly as the con. This is because, far from having referents in concrete realities that are concepts in and of themselves, dialectics instead call into question verbal images, the phantoms of our spirit, which allows itself to be dazzled by this fools gold, this false currency of thought.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enigmatic approach of freemasonry may appear perplexing to some, but it satisfies the needs of those who prefer to contemplate a problem rather than be given a dogmatic solution. Symbolism is inherently difficult to define, and attempts to do so can lead to nothing but meaningless words. The truth may be reached through rigorous reasoning, or it may be hidden in mystery and imparted through symbols, as in the case of Hermeticism."
