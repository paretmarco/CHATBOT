  "title": "The Formation of Desire and the Conscious Mind",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous 316 tokens, the text talks about how the force of desire manifests in humans as either sexual or possessive. It explains the process of how this desire condenses and creates the sentimental and affective parts in humans. The text also discusses the phenomenon of fascination, how it",
  "content": "As it concentrates in one direction, it creates a trance, where reality gets distorted and fixed. We call this phenomenon \"fascination\". an automatic fascination is the basis of the construction of the conscious mind, the crystallized \"exterior I\". This process gives raise to the categorization done by the logical mind as we know it. So we feel ideas and concepts as something separate and autonomous on which we have no more control. This happens also because we dissociate (i.e. we loose contact) from the body, and these processes happen subconsciously. Our emotions, for example, happen in our body, but as we stay external to it, we have very little control over them, and emotions seem to live a life of their own. The fact, is that as consciousness concentrates in the ego, it sees the body as something separate, and rather to feel a sense of oneness with the body, we feel as \"inhabiting\" it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concentration of consciousness in the ego creates a sense of separation from our own body, giving rise to automatic processes such as fascination that can be taken advantage of to heal psychological discord. Understanding this process can help us gain more control over our emotions and transcend our current state towards a more unified and whole state of mind. Practicing techniques such as hypnosis and mesmerism can be transformational for achieving this goal."
