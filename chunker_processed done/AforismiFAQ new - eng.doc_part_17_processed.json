  "title": "\"The Importance of Gaze in Mesmerismus © Practice\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the concept of \"fluid\" or vital energy is explored in the practice of mesmerismus©. The author highlights the importance of recognizing and feeling the fluid rather than just discussing it in words or concepts. They also address the question of whether mesmerismus© is a placebo and emphasize that it involves more than just energy, including hypnosis. Finally, the author tackles the question of whether belief is necessary to practice mesmerismus©.",
  "content": "It serves no benefit to discuss what it actually is. What matters is that one should recognize it. When it comes to knowing what it actually is, we are legitimately entitled to follow what Lao-Tse has to say: “Knowing not to know is the quality of the sage. Thinking that we know is a disease”. We do not actually know what this reality we call fluid, which is moreover augmented by developing one’s consciousness, precisely amounts to. Is mesmerismus © a form of placebo? As regards energy and its effects, there are actually several studies attesting to the contrary. In any event, it should be additionally stressed that mesmerismus © is not just energy. One part of it becomes blurred with what we call by the name hypnosis. If we are inclined to regard hypnosis as a placebo, then that one part of mesmerismus ©, too, is placebo, albeit one displaying effects which are not attainable through traditional or Ericksonian forms of hypnosis, at least not at the same level of consistency and consciousness. Does one have to believe in something in order for him to practice mesmerismus ©?",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, while there is still much unknown about mesmerismus © and its effects, having a positive belief and being open to the possibilities of energy and consciousness can lead to potentially transformative results. The importance of the gaze, as well as other aspects of mesmerismus ©, is still being explored and studied."
