  "title": "The Power of Fascination: The Strange Abilities of Donato",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, Donato's hypnosis was introduced, showcasing its power and effects on individuals. In the final 200 tokens, the author shares a report by Dr. Servais, who documented Donato's hypnotic abilities during an experiment in Paris in 1876. Donato's gaze and gestures were so powerful that they caused the subject to experience paralysis or deep disturbances to their intellectual functions. In an earlier encounter, Donato joked with a young student about hysteria, highlighting the widespread belief of that time that only histrionic people were hypnotizable.",
  "content": "The latter attempts to avoid his persistent look, but his efforts to that effect are in vain; he is nailed to his place, his eye inextricably bound with the shimmering pupil of his fascinator. He tries to speak. With a gesture, Donato stops him. The subject is not asleep: He is perfectly awake and is distinctly conscious of the state of powerlessness which Donato has coerced him into. He is later going to lose consciousness of his actions. This will represent a different stage of the process. Sleep, however, never sets in, unless the experimenter wills otherwise and acts accordingly. The subject is seated? He is unable to stand up. He is in a standing position? In that case, he can neither bend his knees nor flex his body. His hand is open? He is incapacitated from closing it. Through a look (induced wonderment) and a gesture, Donato occasions the total or partial paralysis of the body, while a single gaze of him causes deep disturbances to the intellectual functions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is clear that fascination can be very powerful and can cause significant changes in a person's physical and intellectual state. While it may be relatively simple to induce in nervous subjects, the effects can be profound and far-reaching. It is important to be aware of the potential dangers of fascination and to approach it with caution and respect."
