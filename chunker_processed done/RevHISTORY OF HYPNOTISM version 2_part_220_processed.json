  "title": "Baron Reichenbach's Research on Magnetism and Human Sensitivity",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the work of Baron Reichenbach, who conducted extensive experiments on extreme sensitives for over 30 years. He sought to distinguish between actual sensitivity and mere suggestion, using people from different social classes and nationalities. His findings revealed that magnets, when arranged in a specific way, could stop pain at the molecular level. However, the baron's work went beyond physical magnets, as he also theorized about a natural 'human magnetism.' In this last part, we will explore how the Durville brothers later developed his theories and the high similarity they have with older conceptions of energy and Eastern techniques.",
  "content": "As Ormond Mac Gill reports: “Experiments revealed that the North Pole of a magnet placed over an afflicted part of the patient has a very different effect from that of the South Pole. In testing, he noted that the negative position of the magnet tended to control inflammation in human joints and aided in more rapid healing of injuries while exerting an antibiotic effect on bacteria and a sedating effect on nerves…Recent studies reported by dr. Robert R. Holcomb at Vanderbilt University claim that four magnets together arranged alternating as positive and negative poles can stop the pain at a molecular level”105. But the work of Baron of Reichenbach was not only with physical magnets. His theory was even of a natural ‘human magnetism’ that was in some way ‘polarized’. It is to note that the work of the baron of Reichenbach was later developed by the Durville brothers at the beginning of the 1900s. Schema of human body polarities Furthermore, Reichenbach’s theory of positive and negative od has a very high similarity both with older conceptions dating back to the antiquity of positive and negative energy (fire and water), and with oriental techniques.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of polarities is not only relevant in physics but also in the field of healing. The use of magnets with alternating poles can control inflammation, antibiotics and even stop pain at the molecular level. Furthermore, the theory of positive and negative energies can be found in ancient traditions and philosophies. Additionally, the concept of being grounded or Tellurism plays a significant role in the process of healing. These ideas provide a new perspective for hypnotherapists and other healthcare professionals seeking alternative techniques for treatment."
