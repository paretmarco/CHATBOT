  "content": "In a materialistic point of view we think of energy, such as a light or electricity, as a non-conscious force that interacts with matter. In our vision, energy is vital force, and what permit us to perceive and fully live the world . Energy and consciousness are therefore strictly related. Experience teaches us that personal magnetism can be enhanced through energetic exercises. As energy changes our state of consciousness, it changes our awareness field. As a person becomes more aware of itself, he/she is less dependent from external approval. He will be also and more able to rely on intuition and inner directions for acting in life. An enhanced energy permits us thus both a strong hold on reality, both with our inner self,. In this state some part of us is able to touch an higher dimension beyond the three-dimensional world. In other words, we get in contact with the implicate order of vibrations in which we are and from which we create our explicate three dimensional world through our senses and our brain mechanism.",

By practicing energetic exercises and developing our awareness, we gain a stronger sense of self-reliance and intuition. These skills can lead to personal growth and even unlock hidden potentials beyond our current understanding."
