  "first_phrase": "In this text, we learn about the remarkable work of Prof. Erminio, a forceful personality known for treating various types of pain and pathologies with instant healing techniques. He wrote a successful book on the topic and also performed Instant Regressions for healing purposes. Interestingly, Prof. Erminio learned this discipline from another master, Prof. Caravelli, who was an expert in the art of \"bi-location.\" We also learn of another practitioner, Di Pisa, who used reflected light in his work. All of these techniques suggest a quantum view of the world, where everything is connected beyond the ordinary senses.",
  "content": "He did also Instant Regressions (regressions based on fascination and with an induction lasting less than 5 seconds), i.e. bringing a person to his past. This also can be useful for healing purposes It is thus from him that we have learnt how to employ this art for healing purposes. Prof. Erminio, too, had been directly introduced to this discipline, in 1973, by another master: Prof. Caravelli. The latter was a masterful expert in the so-called art of “bi-location”, so much so that he could be simultaneously perceived in two different places. Di Pisa, too, practiced similar techniques. We note that in a quantum view of the world, location is a construction of the senses. At a quantum implicate level of reality, everything is connected. The key is going beyond sensing reality in the ordinary way. The exercise of Di Pisa used reflected light as an important tool. Prof. Di Pisa was also a fervent admirer of Donato, and he sometimes used the name “Prof. Donato”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of regression and bi-location practiced by Prof. Di Pisa and his mentor, Prof. Caravelli, can be used for healing purposes. By going beyond ordinary senses and connecting with the quantum reality, one can gain deep insights and even give mediumistic diagnoses. Attention to detail and being truly present are key qualities for success in this field."
