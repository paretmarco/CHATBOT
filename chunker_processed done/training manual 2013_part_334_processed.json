  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the importance of presence in enhancing perception and achieving human happiness is explored through various planes of consciousness. The concept of quintessence, a state of power and central presence, is discussed alongside the link between cenesthesia, temperament and sadness. The text suggests two paths to achieve presence and happiness: changing one's temperament or focusing on developing presence. The ancient Egyptian tradition emphasizes presence as the key to standing vertically and helping clients.",
  "content": "Human Happiness AND QUINTESSENCE Presence can bring us to discover very deep powers. But most important is that presence can give us access to a new state, very useful in magnetism. In this state we will stay in a power central state of presence that we could call “quintessence” where all problems of happiness and sadness will vanish and we will recover a new way to being. The problem of human happiness is intimately related to the problem of our cenesthesia, and thus to the special manner, the “tonality”, the “colouring”, in which sensations are received by the organism.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by cultivating presence and accessing the state of quintessence, we can overcome problems of happiness and sadness. Our temperament, which is linked to our sensory perception, can be changed by physical therapies and psychological re-education, but the power to live in the now and balance oneself is the key to being hardly ever unhappy. Consider this ability to live in the present moment as the center of the wheel, and all other aspects of life will revolve around it."
