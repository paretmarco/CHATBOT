  "title": "\"Basile Valentine and the Alchemical Process of the Great Work\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the discussion shifts towards the alchemical process of the Great Work and the need for individuals to visit the inward part of the Earth to rediscover the philosophical and occult stone. The text emphasizes that we cannot understand this dimension while our mind is restless or stagnant, and that the law of inertia is dominating the world. The discussion touches on the perpetual trance of negative thoughts which consume our lives. The text refers to Basile Valentine's formula for the Great Work and the stages of development it encompasses. The text also alludes to concepts such as Mercury, the Shining Star, the First and Second Inspector, and the Column of Bohas.",
  "content": "Vitriol – Visita Interiora Terrae We cannot, however, know this dimension so long as our mind is restlessly agitated and worried, or plunged into indolence. The law of inertia is dominating the world. A body which is left to its own self precipitates downwardly (whence the symbol ? to indicate the “waters”), and lies motionless in the posture where its greatest balance is to be found. In other words, from a certain point of view it selects the conditions which are most suitable for its rest. The spirit, which is not spurred on by any need, drifts around as if it were a cork at the mercy of the waves ?, and lets itself be lulled by them without offering any resistance. Man’s undeveloped ego is in fact a species of ongoing “trance” in which every thing is mechanical: Certain words automatically create certain emotions, and the negative thoughts cast their reflection over the body. This is the perpetual trance which swallows up our life.",
  "last_phrase": "Breaking free from the perpetual trance of our minds requires conscious effort and the willingness to resist external and internal impulses that prey on our consciousness. By practicing self-awareness and fighting against mental inertia, we can gradually achieve clarity and distinct consciousness, free from the vague pleasures and shapeless boredom that plague the majority of people."
