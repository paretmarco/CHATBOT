  "title": "The Difficulty of Transmitting Quantum Vision: Reflections on Erickson's Work.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, we delve deeper into the impact of Milton Erickson's work and how his approach influenced generations of psychotherapists. However, even some of his closest students missed a crucial element of his efficacy. Gregory Bateson and Ernest Rossi are notable names discussed in this section. Bateson reflected on how Erickson's techniques harmonized with the \"total complex\" system by being part of it, providing a valuable insight into the difficulty of conveying quantum perspectives and perspectives on the universe and human beings.",
  "content": "Gregory Bateson Riportiamo al proposito quanto citato da Steve Lankton: Gregory Bateson referred to this shift when he was discussing Erickson in an interview with Brad Keeney, one of his students. The interview took place in 1976, when Erickson’s work was just getting known to a wider audience. Erickson’s name came up during the interview, and Keeney asked if Bateson had been in touch with him recently. Bateson said he hadn’t, only through some of the many students that Bateson had sent to Erickson. Keeney asked what he thought of the books that were coming out about Erickson, and Bateson harrumphed his archetypal British aristocratic harrumph. He said he hated the work, regretted sending people to Erickson, and would do it no more. When Keeney asked him to elaborate, Bateson said that Erickson had a way of entering a system so thoroughly before he acted that he was not an ego separate from the system but part of the “weave of the total complex”. Therefore his techniques arose from within the weave and harmonized with them. Quaderni di Ricerche 3 Quantum Psi apre la strada ad una diversa concezione dell’universo e dell’uomo.",

Its approach can facilitate meaningful experiences and offer ways to tap into our unconscious potential without necessarily requiring a lengthy process.
