  "title": "Understanding Concepts of Self and Energy in Magnetism",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the concept of the self and the importance of being in tune with one's inward individuality. They also touched on the differences between western and eastern practices and the relationship between magnetism and communication. In this final part, the author explores the purpose of magnetic \"passes\" and the existence of a \"fluid\" that is linked to one's vitality. They draw on principles from mesmerismus and Eastern disciplines like prana and chi. The text emphasizes the importance of feeling and recognizing the fluid to understand life.",
  "content": "We might say that, quite frequently, magnetism does establish a close rapport. We might even go as far as stating that the two terms are indistinguishable, inasmuch as the term emphatic relationship refers to the communicative level, whereas the word magnetism relates to a different level of the same reality which is definable, if one has recourse to quantum terminology, to correlation (or more precisely, entanglement). What is the purpose of magnetic “passes”? The governing principle is the following: Energy follows attention as its subordinate. The passes and the movements thus guide the attention in focusing not just on the patient but also on the operator. They have the effect of steering attention, and, thus, of steering the energy as well. It is in any event possible to practice mesmerismus © even without magnetic steps. Does a fluid truly exist? The fluid represents “vital energy”. In Eastern disciplines, it is called either prana or chi. But it is important not to stay in words or concepts. What is important is to feel. The fluid is linked to the relevant person's vitality. Whoever recognizes it will be able to recognize life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of magnetism and fluid may not have a concrete scientific explanation, but they have been used in healing practices such as mesmerismus to guide attention and energy, and represent vital energy that can be felt by recognizing a person's vitality. What is important is to recognize and utilize these concepts effectively rather than fixating on their exact definition."
