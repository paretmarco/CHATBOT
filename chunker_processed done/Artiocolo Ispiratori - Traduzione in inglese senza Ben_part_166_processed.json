  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus shifts towards the utilization of light and reflections in the mesmerist's path. It is mentioned that light has been used from ancient times as a tool for taking the mind to a different level. The author refers to alchemy and Tibetan Buddhist notions of Primordial Field and Clear Light. The text then moves to discuss the LuxMind methodology, which when coupled with magnetic methodology, enables better concentration, attention, and creativity. Furthermore, the methodology is effective for individuals with dysgraphia and dyslexia, and it enhances the results obtained by any magnetic technique.",
  "content": "It might avail the following: Better school results Concentration Development of attention The same methodology, aided by a few modifications, is also shown to be useful in the event of: Dysgraphia Dyslexia It additionally allows the results obtained by any magnetic technique to be enhanced further. Lastly, again in conjunction with magnetic techniques, we can arrive at: Greater intuition Creativity Increasingly more prolonged flashes of clairvoyance.
