  "title": "\"The Essence and the Mid-Point: Exploring Self-Development\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we discovered that self-development teachings highlight the mid-point between two states that are powerful before they become powerless. Many questions were raised during the Tao of Chaos and a-reabsorption of I-dentities development, such as the stability of the midpoint and how to move beyond it. In this final part, we will explore the concept of Essence and its relationship to chaos and the mid-point. Essence is the space before the pendulum starts, beyond the mind, observer/observed, and self-remembering. It is a space where there is just observation, awareness, and knowing without an object, making it a complex and abstract reality.",
  "content": "What are the psychological factors which present and defend against the mid-point? 5. Is there a relationship between chaos and its relationship to the mid-point? In order to understand this more completely, let us move to the space before the pendulum starts. I am going to call this space Essence. I am calling Essence the space prior to movement of I-dentities and even beyond mid-point. The Essence is prior to the mind, prior to the observer/observed, prior to intention, and hence prior to I-dentities. Secondly, the Essence is prior to the mid-point of self-remembering because at this point there is no individual self to remember, not a self to do this practice. At the Essence, there is no mind, no distinctions, no observer to observe, no awareness or awarer to be aware of something, no knower to possess know- ________________ ing. Rather at Essence there is just observation with no object, awareness with nothing to be aware of, and knowing with no knowing about. At first glance this seems abstract, so complicated and obscure that its realization seems to make us spin.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the mid-point requires delving into the Essence - a space beyond the mind, intentions, and identities. At this stage, there are no distinctions, awareness, or knowing with no object. It might seem complex, but the realization of the undifferentiated consciousness brings freedom, availability and a no-mind mind."
