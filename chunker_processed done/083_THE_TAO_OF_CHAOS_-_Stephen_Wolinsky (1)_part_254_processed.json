  "title": "The Unenlightened Buddha: A Premature Detachment from Reality.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the concept of the Unenlightened Buddha is explored further. This strategy involves mistaking ideas and thoughts for experiences, leading to detachment from others due to an internal fear of being engulfed. This premature observation results in an accumulation of things, ideas, and avarice, with the observer/personality dyad's fantasies and ideas presumed to be experiences. This fixation is addressed in character analysis, with the origin of the schizoid personality attributed to intrauterine biological rejection. These insights are taken from Stephen H. Wolinsky's book, Quantum Consciousness: Volume I, Is It Dissociation or Observation? and The Dark Side of the Inner Child.",
  "content": "(Stephen H. Wolinsky, Bramble Books, 1993, Connecticut) 2See Chapter 14, The Dark Side of the Inner Child (Stephen H. Wolinsky, Bramble Books, 1993, Connecticut) THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 205 ization, The Dark Side of the Inner Child. This occurs because this observer/personality dyad implodes rather than feels during an experience and leaves their body thus going in to premature observation. The observer in this fixation labels the emptiness as nothing; hence they accumulate things, ideas, etc. and are subject to avarice. See' Illustration #11. At this placement of attention, the observer/personality dyad's fantasies and ideas are presumed to be experiences. In character analysis the schiziod unknowingly has a deep fear of rejection. Alexander Lowen, M.D. suggests that the schizoid personality originates intrautero and occurs through the biological rejection of the mother.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the schizoid personality requires knowledge of its origin, fear of rejection, body type and its fixation with premature observation. By recognizing and addressing these issues, individuals with a schizoid personality can create a healthier sense of self and more fulfilling relationships."
