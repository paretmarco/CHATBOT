  "title": "\"The Power of Thought-Reading and Curative Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the focus is on the curative powers of mesmerism and the importance of having a positive mindset towards healing. The text mentions that the powers of the early Christians were intensified by their faith and purity of living. It emphasizes the need for sympathetic and positive individuals to heal others. The author stresses that the most powerful healers are those who have strong, healthy vital organizations and are kind-hearted. They explain that people with devitalized organizations cannot be magnetic healers because they can't give what they don't have. Great benefits can be had in the practice of hydropathy, and the bathers or massage therapists should be healthy, cheerful, and buoyant people.",
  "content": "The powers of the early Christians, whether natural '“gifts of healing” or both, were intensified by the simplicity and purity of their living, and the reality of their faith. They doubted not, yet where they doubted they could do no miracles. The man who has “no heart” to relieve disease, or, having sympathy, has no will to do so, is either without the power to do good, or doubting his power, is unable to use it. From such no “virtue” can go forth to heal. Where there is sympathy for suffering, the desire to relieve or remove it, and the will to do so the way soon opens up, and the suffering is removed. The most powerful healers I ever came in contact with had strong, healthy vital organisations, and were large-hearted, kindly-disposed persons. The fact is that persons with devitalised organisations do not make magnetic healers. They cannot give what they have not got. A bankrupt should not bestow gifts—a pauper cannot give alms. In hydropathy, manipulations continue a large-part of the treatment. Great benefits are done if the bathmem or women—the shampooers—are healthy, cheerful, and buoyant people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power to heal comes from within and is intensified by a simple and pure lifestyle, strong vitality, and a large-hearted and sympathetic disposition. The healing gift is possessed by all and is most effective when exercised with goodness and sympathy, with faith that the suffering can be relieved, and with the observance of proper directions for external remedies. Ultimately, the will and desire to relieve suffering are what open the way for healing to take place."
