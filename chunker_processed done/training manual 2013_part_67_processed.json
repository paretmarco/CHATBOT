  "title": "The Power of Symbols and Forces in Human Behavior.",
  "first_phrase": "In part four of this text, we delve into the concept of the life force as believed and practiced by primal people. This force is said to permeate the entire universe and is also present within us. The author quotes Deleuze, emphasizing the importance of physical health and a strong sense of vitality. The text also touches upon the primacy of man's basic state as opposed to the civilized mind. Prior to this, we learned about the power of symbols in our society and the double dimension of physical and psychological perception. The third rule in magnetism is introduced as well, which urges us to think of forces as something external and to feel the force of our gestures and movements.",
  "content": "As to the rest, confidence is only the consequence of belief: it differs in this onlyâ€”one believes himself to be endowed with a power, whose reality he does not doubt. 4. THE LIFE FORCE For the primal people the fact that everything has a life on his own and a force permeates the whole universe is symbolized through the belief in an universal fluid or force. This force is also in us, as there is something that guides our body in restoring itself. FOURTH RULE IN MAGNETISM: vital force is the basis Deleuze: Of physical qualifications, the first is good health, the next a peculiar power, different from that which raises burthens or moves heavy bodies, and of which we recognize the existence and the degree of energy in ourselves, only by the trial we make of it. How the actual terminology most people use should be corrected. The primality of man is its basic state not the civilized mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of vital force and the primal state of man can lead to a greater sense of confidence and belief in oneself. By exploring methods such as hypnosis, meditation, and magic, we can tap into this force and enhance our physical and mental well-being. It's important to recognize that the potential for this force already exists within us, and through practice and belief, we can unlock its power."
