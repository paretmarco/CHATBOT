  "title": "Exercises to Improve Attention and Sensitivity",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, we learned about the different types of attention and how they are linked to our thought process and emotions. We also explored the concept of entering into a trance-like state with the movement of our eyes, and an exercise to minimize this phenomenon. In the final section, we dive into the topic of \"sub-sensorialities\" and how they can be integrated to increase sensitivity. By reintegrating these unconscious sensory responses, we can develop a more complete and powerful vision. Two exercises are then presented, Infinity 1 and Infinity 2, which focus on mental tracking and head movement respectively, and serve to develop and improve attention.",
  "content": "Imagine, therefore, seeing this immensely big sign standing out in brightness. You must, starting from any point, follow the continuous curve, without ever removing the eyes of the mind. This simple exercise helps the inter-hemispheric coordination as well as it makes it more difficult to lose your presence at certain times. Infinity 2 Observed a point in front of you and then executed movements as a lying eight () with the head, so that your pupils are obliged to perform this movement while always looking the point. Try to be always attentive to the point. This exercise develops attention a lot. Restore \"sub-sensorialties\" We define \"sub-sensoriality\" a series of outermost sensorial responses that normally we do not realize, and happen below the level of our consciousness (subliminal). To be increasingly present they must be reintegrated. Integrate sub-sensorialties is the key to increase oneself sensitivity.",
  "last_phrase": "To increase your presence and sensory awareness, try these simple exercises that can be done daily. Follow the continuous curve of an immense sign to improve inter-hemispheric coordination and restore sub-sensorialties. Also, do lying eight movements to develop attention and focus on your aura in front of a mirror to integrate visual sub-sensorial responses. Lastly, move a finger towards your palm to feel magnetic sensations and bring energy to your navel daily. Incorporate these practices into your routine for increased sensitivity and presence."
