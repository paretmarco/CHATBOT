  "title": "\"The History of Mesmerism and Magnetism in Religion\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the historical roots of mesmerism, its predecessors, and its influence in different eras. The author presents the viewpoints of prominent figures, such as Varro and Asclepiades, and references historical accounts of mesmerism in Greece, Gaul, and the Middle Ages. This segment focuses on the French susceptibility to mesmerism and how modern-day hypnotic phenomena are reminiscent of the religious practices of ancient Druidic temples. It also examines the transition of magnetism from ancient practices to the Christian church, with particular attention paid to the successes of treatments.",
  "content": "Women brought up and instructed by the Druids, we are informed, delivered oracles, foretold the future, and cured diseases. The accounts given by Tacitus, Lampridius, and Vopiscus regarding the Druids, bear testimony to the confidence they had in the accuracy of their predictions. Endowed with extraordinary talents, they (the Druidesses) cured diseases deemed incurable, knew the future, and announced it to the people. In the Middle Ages “The Churches” observes M. Mialle, “succeeded the temples of the ancients, into which the traditions and processes of magnetism were consigned—the same habits of passing whole nights in them, the same dreams, the same visions, and the same cures, The true miracles performed on the tombs of the saints are recognized by characters which is not in the power of man to imitate; but we must exclude from the list of the ancient legends a multitude of very extraordinary cures where religion and faith interfered only so far as to produce dispositions eminently favourable to the natural action of magnetism.” A rigid and critical analysis of the records of the middle ages would be here impossible, if not out of place.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, history provides ample evidence of the intriguing talents held by pagan Druidesses, whose abilities to cure diseases and foretell the future were highly valued. As religion evolved during the Middle Ages, miraculous healings continued to occur, often attributed to the power of magnetism. Whether supernatural or not, such events have become the foundation of various religions in different times and places."
