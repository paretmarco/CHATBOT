Magnetism is a method aimed at restoring this lost harmony. It rebalances the rhythms of the body, through a work helped by the presence of another person. Even the convulsions that sometimes characterize the mesmeric therapy are simply energetic reorganizations, that in the end give place to a pleasant feeling of fullness. Connection to the Universe An important message we can derive from mesmeric techniques is the idea of reconnecting and gaining resources for ourselves from the universe. Mesmerâ€™s studies of Astronomy and Astrology, had as their goal the highlighting of the connection between man and the Universe. Everybody, standing at night and looking at the star on the sky understands, that recovering the connection to a higher universal dimension is the basis of health. Even the psychological side feels that it can be more aligned and open. After having denied them, science has now recognized the importance of natural rhythms. It must still investigate the mysterious relationship between man and the Universe. Practical Suggestion Cultivate harmony in yourselves.",
