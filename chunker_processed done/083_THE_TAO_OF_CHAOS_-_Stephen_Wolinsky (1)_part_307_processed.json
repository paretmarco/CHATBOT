  "title": "Therapeutic Session on Interrupting Thought Patterns.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the therapist and the client discuss a crucial juncture in therapy, where it's important to understand the loop between a little boy and his cousin's I-dentity. This will help the client to stop projecting his cousin's identity on others and experiencing them as his cousin. By creating an energy loop and watching it, the underlying order is revealed as an energetic pattern that can iterate many times. The text highlights the importance of identifying the gap between different states in memory breaks.",
  "content": "This is crucial because he trance-fers his cousin on others, and hence experiences others as his cousin, thus the revengeful thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the whole loop must be taken apart so that the man in 1992 doesn't re-enact this anger with everyone again and again. Therapist: Create the loop as energy and watch it, allowing it to do what it does. Therapeutic Note This relates back to Iteration and the Mandelbrot Mandala. Often the underlying order is revealed as an energic pattern and is allowed to iterate (repeat) many times. Client: It just spins around and disappears. Therapeutic Note In each of the memory breaks, there is a gap, after a bifurcation point of intensity. This is demonstrated as we move from state to state. For example, as we move from a thought, such as \"I like myself,\" to the thought \"I hate myself,\" there is a gap, space, or midpoint where one state turns into another state. The way we stated this earlier was by using the metaphor of the film strip. With a film strip, there is a picture and a gap or space and then another picture.",
  "last_phrase": "In therapy, it's crucial to dismantle the loop of anger and revengeful thoughts to prevent re-enactment in future interactions. By creating a loop as energy and watching it with the Mandelbrot Mandala technique, a person can identify gaps between intense emotions and allow them to dissipate, releasing built-up energy. By recognizing these gaps, one can remember themselves and work through traumatic memories without sublimating their emotions onto others."
