  "title": "\"Developing Psychometry: Understanding the Power of Thought Reading\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the mysterious phenomenon of psychometry, where individuals can gain insight into the history and associations of an object simply by holding it. The author provides a step-by-step guide on how to develop this ability, starting with giving a trusted sensitive a personal belonging of someone they don't know. The text goes on to explain that with careful cultivation, a sensitive's descriptions will become increasingly accurate and reliable, even going back to childhood and uncovering hidden motivations. The last 200 tokens criticize the performances of some famous thought readers, while praising Edwin James for providing a genuinely intellectual entertainment.",
  "content": "His keenness of spiritual perception will be so great as to go back to all the conditions which have surrounded the life of the person examined, from his childhood, and into the motives which have influenced certain departures, mistakes, and successes in his life. In time your sensitive on being presented an old key, or axe, or a geological specimen, will give you an equally accurate and reliable description of its history and associations, which will make you declare that truth is stronger than fiction. In some instances, without being put asleep, by simply sitting in a passive condition, psychometry can be cultivated. HOW TO DEVELOP THOUGHT READING. To this category belong thought transference and mind-reading. The performances of Mr. Irving Bishop, Mr. Stuart Cumberland, and Mr. Edwin James, were called thought-reading entertainments. The entertainments of the two former being a compound of trickery very bad conjuring muscleâ€”reading nous, and audacity, combined with effeminate organisations, furnished them with the requisite qualifications for their exhibition. Mr. Edwin James has a higher claim to the title of thought reader than either of the other two, because he really gave an excellent intellectual treat for an entertainment.",
  "last_phrase": "To cultivate psychometry and thought reading, it takes a keen spiritual perception and a willingness to ignore the trickery seen in certain performances. With dedication and patience, one can develop the ability to accurately describe the history and associations of items and reproduce scenes with precision. Remember, truth is stronger than fiction, and with these skills, you can gain a deeper understanding of the world around you."
