  "title": "\"Melt Away Worries: The Path to Inner Harmony\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, the text elaborates on the need for acquiring \"philosophical melters\" in order to establish a connection with life. Now, the author describes the process of attaining these melters through exercises and techniques focused on energy. This includes achieving power over sexual and vertical energy represented by the symbol \"potassium nitrate\". However, the attainment of verticality requires relinquishing individualistic ego, as automatic responses are subservient to reflexes. The process of breaking this chain of automatic responses is called the \"acquisition of the tartarus\". Techniques for this process include relaxation and letting energy flow freely. The concept of \"blocked energy\" was also discussed with reference to Franz Anton Mesmer.",
  "content": "The relevant symbol is the “potassium nitrate” E. The idea of the “Nitrum” reminds us of the foundational power which we are going to recover, while the symbol brings the vertical line to our mind. The attainment of the verticality E, however, can only occur through the relinquishment of the individualistic ego ? (the horizontality), as the latter perceives the totality F as being subservient to the automatic nature of reflexes. The path that needs to be treaded for the sake of breaking the chain of automatic responses is to begin to let chaos choose, i.e. to free automatic responses from their inherently automatic nature (the symbol indicating such a process is k). This process is also termed “acquisition of the tartarus ”, that is, the attainment of dissolving power. Such intake can additionally take place by having recourse to techniques of relaxation, alternatively, by letting energy go wherever it likes. This is what used to be done by Franz Anton Mesmer, who was accustomed to see tensions and problems as no more than “blocked energy” which was in need of circulating again.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the attainment of verticality and dissolving power requires letting go of the individualistic ego and becoming aware of the blocked energy within ourselves. By allowing this energy to circulate and dissolve, we can overcome bodily density and ties to the material world. To attain harmony, we must use the universal solvent and allow ourselves to be guided by our intuitional recognition of it within us. These practical steps can help us break the chain of automatic responses and achieve greater spiritual awareness."
