  "title": "\"Magnetism and the Influence of Deleuze on its Revaluation\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text recounts several cases of successful magnetism healing by Deleuze. The first describes how Deleuze relieved a man's pains through his guidance fueled by magnetism, which he was able to use his legs again. The second case tells of a woman struggling with pain whom Deleuze also helped heal through magnetism. In this text, we see the influence of Deleuze's book, \"Histoire Critique du Magnetisme,\" which compelled many distinguished scientists to examine and acknowledge the evidence in favor of magnetism healing.",
  "content": "he spoke to her ; and this is a summary of their conversation : Are you asleep ? Yes, sir. Why do you sleep ? I do not know. Do you see what the matter is with you ? (After a little reflection,) Nothing is the matter with me but my pain in the shoulder. What must be done to relieve you? You are now doing what will cure me. In how long a time? Three days. If, when you are awakened, I tell you to come three or four days successively, will you do it? Yes, sir. Deleuze then caused this woman to come four days, and since that time, she was no more ill. The influence of Deleuze In the academic field, after the appearance of the book “Histoire Critique du Magnetisme”, by Deleuze, many men of the highest scientific eminence felt compelled, by the cogency of the evidence in its favour, to examine the facts.",
  "last_phrase": "Ultimately, Deleuze's success in treating the woman's pain paved the way for a renewed interest in the study of animal magnetism, with many esteemed scientists coming to acknowledge its potential. As a result of this growing acceptance, a second commission was established to investigate the subject, leading to the Academy of Medicine exploring magnetism once again."
