  "title": "\"Mercury: The Key Element in Hermetic Alchemy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we learn about the importance of mercury in the practice of alchemy. The Initiate, who knows himself as the Child of Putrefaction, is not afraid of the restorative process. The symbol of mercury is the universal agent of material nature, the messenger of the gods, and the essential intermediary between different planes of existence. The addition of the Cross to the Alkaline Salt mark a fertilisation that animates the first matter of the sages. The hermetic philosophers named mercury Azoe, which represents the beginning and the end of every earthly body.",
  "content": "In this sense Mercury appears to us as the fundamental essence of life of material objects, the starting point from which all things are produced, develop and transformed. It is the universal agent of material nature, the messenger of the gods; in other words, the essential intermediary between the different planes of existence, or the eternal mediator. If we now return to what we know about Alkaline Salt we can understand the way in which this sign is altered by the addition of the Cross , which indicates here that a fertilisation has taken place. The first matter of the sages, which is suitable to be used for almost any kind of metamorphosis, becomes animated by way of this life-generating development, and becomes capable of actually carrying all of its potentialities through to realisation. The hermetic philosophers used numerous terms to refer to mercury , but primarily they gave it the name Azoe, which according to Planiscampus should be written , in order that it be kabbalistically composed of the first letter common to all alphabets, A, followed by the last letter in Latin Z, Greek and Hebrew . Azoth represents, simultaneously, the beginning and the end of every earthly body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through the understanding of the properties and symbolism of Mercury and Azoth, we can grasp the essence of the universal life force that drives all material nature. Moreover, we can appreciate how the addition of the Cross alters the Alkaline Salt to initiate the process of metamorphosis and bring forth the potentialities of the first matter. By spiritualizing and sublimating the Gem Salt, we can attain the highest virtues and rise above our material worth to connect with the celestial spirit. Ultimately, this knowledge can help us gain a deeper insight into the workings of the universe and our place within it."
