  "title": "Understanding Quintessence: A Higher State of Balance",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of quintessence, which refers to a shared fundamental substance that contains the four elements: hot, dry, moist, and cold. The fifth essentia, or quintessence, is at the center of this concept, representing a higher state of balance that allows individuals to stay in more levels at the same time. The discussion also delves into the \"sensorium commune\" of Franz Anton Mesmer, which is a meta-sense that lies beyond other senses and can perceive elements that elude perception by single senses. This sixth sense is immersed in the totality of reality, making it useful for problem-solving. The text ends with Aristotle's saying that \"the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\"",
  "content": "We further notice that the relation between this “meta-sense” and the other senses directly influences perceptions. The “sensorium commune” is, in the view of Mesmer, even the “sixth sense”, on the basis that it is capable of perceiving elements which elude the perception by the single senses in isolation. The reason for it is that the sixth sense is immersed in the waters of reality itself, which is understood in its nature as totality, whereas every single sense cannot but perceive one part of reality only. From a practical point of view, if we have a problem we might be able to observe it through the single (rational) senses. If we cannot however solve the situation, it would be useful to establish contact with this quintessence. The quintessence is located beyond the single elements, even though it forms the basis thereof. 97 In order to explain the concept, we might even recall the saying of Aristotle to the effect that “the whole is more than the sum of its parts”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by establishing contact with the Sensorium Commune, which serves as the sixth sense, one can attain a state of presence that allows them to transcend situations, be in control of themselves, and free from fears. This quintessence is a natural part of reality beyond the single elements, and by utilizing it freely, one can tap into its power to solve problems and reconnect with nature."
