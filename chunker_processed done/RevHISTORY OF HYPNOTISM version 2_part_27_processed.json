  "title": "\"The Power of Magnetism: Importance of Open Mind and Non-Verbal Communication\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding segment, we delve deeper into the intrinsic connection between the human state of mind and the practice of magnetism. The author emphasizes the importance of having an open and curious mind, free from the constraints of rationality, to explore the realm of non-verbal communication. They highlight how magnetism is a natural phenomenon that can be learnt easily with the right mindset, and often yield seemingly impossible results. The text sheds light on the limitations of human knowledge and rationality, and how an open mind can help embrace the unknown.",
  "content": "Everything is naturally connected to the state of mind of the operator: an openness and curiosity of the mind is a must have. The practice of magnetism, to be effective, could be instead based on the perception of reality as a wave of probability, as something in which the human presence and consciousness can make the difference. Many times, with this frame of mind, apparent impossible results can become reality if we would just allow it. A good attitude is thinking that there is more to know than science actually knows. In everybody’s life there are coincidences, synchronicities that many times cannot be fully rationalized. This is natural, as rationality is only a human veil that we try to put on a reality that is wider. Quantum physics easily shows some of the paradoxes of the linear thinking. And probably in the future mankind will make other discoveries. Therefore it is useful to have both a lucid mind as well as an open mind in accepting that we know only the surface layer of things. Most of the people tend to reject what they don’t know, even in the academic field.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to effectively practice magnetism, one must have an open and curious mind that acknowledges the limitations of human knowledge. By accepting the existence of the unknown, we grant ourselves the opportunity to discover new truths and understand the power of our own consciousness. Approaching magnetism with a humility that welcomes the unexpected can lead to unexpected results and unlock the potential of the mind-body connection."
