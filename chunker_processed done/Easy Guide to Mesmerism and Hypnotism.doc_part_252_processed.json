  "title": "\"Exploring Mesmerism: Practical Tips and Further Inquiry\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text concludes the study of Mesmerism, with a focus on subtle phenomena of telepathy and clairvoyance. Practical and inexpensive instructions have been given, with the suggestion to supplement them with the works of authors such as Heidenhain and Deleuze. However, the author notes that practical instruction is best conveyed through an experienced instructor. The conclusion is followed by Dr. Paret's thoughts on the work of Dr. J. Coates, outlining the basic exercises of the magnetic school. This restoration of the old school's corpus aims to fill gaps left by the diffusion of Mesmerism.",
  "content": "However valuable reading may be, practical instruction at best can only be poorly conveyed by such means, and those who are really anxious to know “How to Mesmerise,” should add to the information gleaned from books, the personal or viva voce directions of an experienced instructor or the writer. THE END DR. PARET’S CONCLUSIONS The work of Dr. J. Coates is very interesting. I agree with everything he writes. What Dr. Coates brings to us is the knowledge of what could be done through magnetism, and in his last words he explains that not everything has been said. The exercises he describes are very basic ones. In the appendix we will try to outline more about them and at this point nothing will be precluded from the practitioner. We worked hard to restore the “corpus” of the old school. Magnetism and Mesmerism were diffused by many persons, and in this process of vulgarization some elements of the old school got lost as the discipline diffused itself. I will give an outline of the most basic exercises of the magnetic school.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while reading is valuable, practical instruction is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of Mesmerism. Dr. Coates' work provides insight into the potential of magnetism, and the basic exercises outlined in the appendix offer a starting point for practitioners. The power of magnetism can enhance other modern techniques, and there is a real power that anyone can acquire through careful instruction. Consider exploring the roots of Mesmerism and its relation to energy flows in Traditional Chinese Medicine for a more holistic approach."
