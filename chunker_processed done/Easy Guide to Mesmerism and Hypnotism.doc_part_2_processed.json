  "title": "\"The Power of Mental Fascination: Unveiling the Secrets of a Rare Hypnotic Technique\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Dr. Marco Paret recounts how his team encountered techniques that yielded results beyond their modern approaches such as NLP and hypnosis. Now, in the final segment, he delves into the ancient techniques of the old secret magnetic school, focusing on the power of Mental Fascination. He tells the story of Virgilio, a man who practiced a rare form of hypnotism, without ever touching or speaking to his subject, and shares a remarkable example of his ability to hypnotize in only a few seconds. This section is an insightful and eye-opening exploration of the untapped potential of the human mind.",
  "content": "In practice, we had results beyond what we thought could ever be possible. One of the sources of these unusual techniques was a quiet man living in a small village. He practiced a very rare way of hypnotizing. Without ever speaking to or touching them, he was able to hypnotize a subject in a matter of only a few seconds. His technique was something you would expect to see in a movie rather than what you expect to see in real life. A simple example: the first time a friend of mine went to him, he was in a shop. My friend spoke with him about various matters, and in the end they arrived to speak about hypnotism. At this point, Virgilio said: “I will show you”. There were other two persons inside and he asked the first of them: “Would you like to be hypnotized?” The other answered with a touch of defiance: “If you are capable of doing it, go ahead”. Virgilio only said, “Look here,” and afterwards he didn’t speak anymore. In 2 or 3 seconds the face of the person he was looking at was completely transformed, without any expression.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the unusual techniques of Virgilio, the quiet man living in a small village who practiced rare hypnotizing techniques, proved to exceed expectations in their effectiveness and efficiency. His rapid and mental suggestion-based methods showcase a level of skill that is truly remarkable and unexpected in real life."
