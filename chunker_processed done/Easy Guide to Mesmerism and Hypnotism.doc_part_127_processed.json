  "first_phrase": "In this last section, we delve into the practical aspects of Mesmerismus and how it can benefit anyone seeking to improve their performance, using the experiences of Dr. Liebault, one of the most talented hypnotists of his time, and an editor's note on the relevance of magnetism to this day. The author suggests that experimenters act believing in a specific influence and that all moves and passes could be vehicles to conduct it. The case of a gentleman suffering from sleeplessness helps to illustrate the practical benefits of Mesmerismus.",
  "content": "Editorâ€™s Note: The same is true today; many scientists do not want to use magnetism because it is difficult to find a scientific basis for it. And, for will power to act, it is necessary to believe in something that is not scientifically proven. But the person doing it risks going on a low level performance. If for a person the results are important, it is important he learns Mesmerismus. In 1880 I was engaged in Glasgow to attend a case in Uddingston. The gentleman had been professionally engaged for many years abroad. Through ill health he had to return home to Scotland. Shortly after his arrival, he took seriously ill, seemed to lose all hold upon life and interest therein. His case was complicated by sleeplessness. Here, again, medical skill had applied every known means to give relief. Bromides and chlorals, draughts and subcutaneous injections, seemed to intensify his sufferings and wakefulness, instead of giving relief. I was engaged by the direction of the family physician and the consulting professor. I found for six weeks he had little or no sleep, and the patient was very weak, nervous, and irritable.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Mesmerismus can provide practical results when medical means fail on cases of illness and sleeplessness. While some may dismiss it as mere imagination or coincidence, its potential benefits for the patient cannot be disputed."
