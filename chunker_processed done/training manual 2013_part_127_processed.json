  "title": "\"The Importance of Staying in the Present\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking text, the author discusses the concept of linear time and its advantages and problems. They begin by citing philosopher Eric Neumann's idea that a ''reflecting'' consciousness is required for the existence of history. The text highlights how the more we rely on the linearity of time, the more we live in our ego: a separate entity from our body. The author also explores how emotions are the product of time's experience, while a linear time can also distance us from the present and reality of our lives. The text concludes with a quote by Blaise Pascal that emphasizes the importance of living in the present rather than hoping to live in the future or past.",
  "content": "Rather than focusing our attention on the surrounding in which we are in a particular moment , or rather than paying attention to the things we're doing in a certain moment, we (actually) think about things or surroundings where we used to be in a specific past, or we think about things we are going to plan in the future. In doing so, we alienate from the present and this is another aspect of the ego which is split out from the body. For the body, the only existing time is the now, and the individualistic ego is not in it. As Blaise Pascal wrote: \"we are so unwise that we wonder about times which do not belong to us, and we do not care of the only one which belong, instead. so vain that we dream of times that are not and blibly flee the only one that is... As consequence, we never live, but hope to live. \"3 The more our ego is individualistic, the more we perceive the sense of time.",
  "last_phrase": "To reap the full benefits of your actions, it's pivotal to stay grounded in the present rather than dwell on the past or ponder the future. By being present, you can strengthen the impact of your efforts and enjoy the only time that truly belongs to us - now."
