  "title": "\"The Phenomenon of Donatism: A New Form of Hypnosis\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we learned about the power of mesmerism and its varied results. In this part, we get a look into \"Donatism,\" a complex form of hypnosis that causes forced contraction of muscles to limit movement, and also uses eye fixation to produce a state of fascination. Dr. Moll sums it up as a process where the subject imitates every movement of the experimenter. Donato operates on strangers and manages to create an endless variety of dramatic situations, a perfect spectacle of hypnotism.",
  "content": "As Morselli tells us: “Donatism” is a complex phenomenon, a little different from classical hypnotism and Braidism, which, for the most part, brings about unconsciousness, and amnesia. Dr. Moll put it thus: “As I saw in Paris, Donato uses a particular process to bring about the state of fascination. This process aims at a primary forced contraction of all the muscles of the body, in order to thereby limit the voluntary movements as much as possible. In this case, the eyes of the hypnotist and the subject are firmly fixed on one another. The subject finally follows every movement of the experimenter. If he moves backwards, the subject follows suit; if he steps forward, the subject does the same. In the same way, the latter imitates every movement of the experimenter, provided, however, that he knows he is intended to do so. We see here, as in the abovementioned third experiment, that fascination might be a primary form of hypnosis.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Donatism is a unique form of hypnotism that involves inducing the state of fascination through a process of contracting muscles and fixed eye-gaze. While it may differ from classical hypnotism and Braidism, it can be achieved both primarily and secondarily. Understanding the elements of Donato's meetings, such as the examination of the room arrangement, can provide insights into this complex phenomenon."
