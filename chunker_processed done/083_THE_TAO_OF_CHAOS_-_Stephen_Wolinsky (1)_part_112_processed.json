  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, Dr. Stephen Wolinsky explores the concept of the second implicate order which lies outside of time and space. He explains how entering into chaos and utilizing the bifurcation point can reveal past memories and lead to resolution of chaos. He also dives into the idea of energy transfer in psychology and how words and sounds are solidified energy. This section offers insight into the power of intensification and utilizing chaos to unveil hidden truths.",
  "content": "This process is also used in structural family therapy, intensifying the problem when parents deny the chaos of a teenager who is acting out. This approach forces the parents into a bifurcation point with the hope of getting them to shift and organize around the child and recognize the Chaos. The Movement of Energy Energy in its colloquial sense usually brings up the idea of movement. In the land of psychology, energy usually means something of a transfer of energy from one person to another or one person to a situation. For example, it is widely accepted that if I talk with you, there is a transfer of an unseen substance called energy from me to you or from you to me. This transfer of energy comes in the form of words, or it could be said that energy is the medium and the words and sounds 80 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS are the message. Actually, words or sounds are solidified energy, and so are you. For example, at a very basic level if I say, \"I like you,\" the energy is solidified and translated by you into a feeling of well-being, or maybe a picture or impression in your mind of something pleasant like feeling appreciated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of energy transfer in psychology can help us recognize the impact of our words and interactions on others, and how they solidify into impressions in the psyche. Structural family therapy is an approach that utilizes this understanding to shift and organize families around the chaos of a troubled teenager, forcing parents to recognize the issue and work towards a solution. By being mindful of the energy we transfer, we can create positive and meaningful interactions with others."
