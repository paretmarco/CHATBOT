  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the use of certain gestures and contact to heal patients. He also talks about the cavern consecrated to Pluto and Juno, where the priests slept for the sake of the patients. Additionally, the author mentions the idea of spiritual influences and spiritual faith in relation to healing. In the last 200 tokens, the discussion moves towards the use of mesmerism among the Persans and Romans. The author notes the incredible value of Persan mages recognized by the Romans and their similarities with the principles of Animal Magnetism. They also discuss how the use of breathing, stroking, and inducing sleep was a common practice among the disciples of Esculapius for the recovery of health.",
  "content": "It were easier to believe that Socrates had a demon, that is— a real sentient (but spiritual) being who communicated with him—as he believed—than accept the foregoing, or conclude with M. Liebault, 'that Socrates' laboured under attacks of temporary insanity. Spiritual influences and spiritual faith were not confined to the Israelites. Editor’s Note: MESMERISM AMONG THE PERSANS Even if Dr. Coates didn’t cite them, we will speak of Persans. The Romans recognised the incredible value of Persan Mages, and we note striking similarities within the principles of Animal Magnetism and those of Mazdean Culture. The ancient Zoroastrian religion was deeply connected to the force of the Nature and the ancient Persans developed many techniques for helping the development of the powerful hidden Natural Powers. MESMERISM AMONG THE ROMANS Esculapius delivered oracles in a dream for the cure of his patients. He breathed on the diseased parts, or allayed pain by the stroking of his hands and often, as also did his disciples, threw his other patients into long and refreshing sleeps for the recovery of health.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, throughout history, there have been numerous instances of spiritual and natural powers being used for healing and other benefits. The similarities between these practices and modern-day mesmerism cannot be denied. By understanding and studying these past practices, we can continue to develop and improve our understanding of the power of the mind and body."
