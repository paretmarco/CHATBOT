  "title": "\"Mesmerism: Local and General Treatment for Cure of Disease\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, we delve deeper into the practice of mesmeric treatment for curing diseases. The author stresses the need for a focused approach to healing and the avoidance of experimental methods. They highlight the importance of understanding the disturbances in the life forces and the pursuit of harmony for a successful cure. Local and general passes, as well as the equalization of magnetic circulation, can alleviate symptoms and infuse warmth and life into the weak areas. However, the author warns against expecting Mesmerism to cure all diseases and advises offering help where possible to patients.",
  "content": "By local and general passes, according to the circumstances, in each case, you will dissipate the heated or feverish symptoms, banish all evil influences, and infuse warmth and life where there are none. Equalise the “magnetic circulation” throughout the organisation by withdrawing from each organ, or part, as are overcharged, and conveying the same to those parts where there is feebleness or deficiency, and finally, imparting such magnetism from yourself as you are willing and able to give to restore them to a state of case or health again. Remember, Mesmerism is not a cure-all. There are diseases of such a character, arising from hereditary taint, constitutional defects, and organic causes, which can never be cured in this world, only you, as a mesmerist, should not say so. Give help when and where you can, according to your strength.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing Mesmerism can bring relief and comfort to patients suffering from various ailments, but it's important to recognize its limitations. By restoring magnetism, equalizing circulation, and providing soothing passes, you can ease symptoms, impart hope, and improve your patient's well-being. Don't forget the power of sleep, particularly in chronic and nervous conditions, and use your Mesmerism skills to aid your patients to your best ability."
