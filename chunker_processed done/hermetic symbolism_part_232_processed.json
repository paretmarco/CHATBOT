  "title": "\"Understanding the Role of Gaze in Accessing Higher Realities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the new informational view of physics that recognizes information as an expression of the organization of energy and matter in the natural evolution of the universe. Building on this, the last 200 tokens delve into the concept of the Gaze and how it can facilitate occult medicine. The Gaze is a metaphor for understanding the connection between matter, energy, and information. When we observe objects, our eyes search for information, and we measure them, putting us in a 'point of view.' By allowing the gaze to open and defocus, we can enter a more undefined state and recover the whole. This is something that can be done individually in front of a mirror. The idea is that by changing the way we filter information, we can access higher orders of reality and facilitate healing.",
  "content": "we will now observe the visual one. Through thousands of experiences we have seen that there is a direct correspondence between what is written above and some physical actions. As we observe objects we search for information, we measure them. Our eyes, through the operations of convergence and accomodation put us in a 'point of view'. More, we detach from the background some elements that we define. If emotions are linked to what we observe, we feel it as a \"reality\". We are in some way cooling down both our observation and our body, as emotions are felt inside the body. And often massage therapists work to make the muscles loose. with the gaze we can do this even faster. If we allow the gaze to open, we begin to recover the whole. If we defocalize a little, we can enter into an even more undefined state. This is something a person can do by himself in front of a mirror. It is to notice that, by looking at ourselves in a mirror, we will have the impression of a \"mist\" as our vision will become more and more blurred.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, our gaze and observing skills can have a profound impact on our physical and emotional state. By allowing our gaze to open up and defocalizing, we can enter a deeper realm of the mind and experience different sensations. Therefore, taking a few moments to practice this technique can greatly benefit our overall well-being."
