  "title": "The Two Principles: Alchemy, Nadis, and Kundalini.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the connection between alchemy and Eastern philosophy through the concept of two principles. Now, we will delve deeper into these principles by examining the role of Nadis - channels of the subtle body that carry life force energy - in Indian philosophy. We will also look at how the Ida and Pingala nadis are connected to the hemispheres of the brain and how practices such as Pranayama can stimulate them. These concepts shed light on the complex interplay between different aspects of our being and give us a better understanding of our physical and mental selves.",
  "content": "Pingala is the extroverted (Active), solar nadi, and it is linked to the right hand side of the body as well as to the left hand side of the brain. Ida is the introverted lunar nadi and it is linked to the left hand side of the body and the right hand side of the brain as well (the crossing occurs in the optical chiasm). The nadis are also said to have an extrasensory function, playing a part in the empathic and instinctive responses. The two nadis are believed to be stimulated through different practices, including Pranayama, which involves alternate breathing through left and right nostrils, which would respectively and alternately stimulate the left and right sides of the brain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the functions and stimulation of the two main nadis, Ida and Pingala, can be achieved through practices like Pranayama. These nadis are not only physical but also have an extrasensory function in the body. The Caduceus of Hermes serves as a symbolic representation, highlighting the power of kundalini and conscious flight through higher planes, which is achievable through the correct stimulation of these channels."
