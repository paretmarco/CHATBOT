  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored how boundaries are essential for our existence as separate individuals. In this closing passage, the Tao of Chaos challenges us to examine those boundaries and experience non-boundaried existence. Through a simple exercise of designating our inner and outer spaces, we can realize that the only thing separating them is the condensed space of our skin boundary. This insight aligns with Einstein's belief that everything is made of emptiness and condensed substance. By understanding and experiencing the nature of our boundaries, we can open the doorway to greater interconnectedness with the world around us.",
  "content": "Step II Designate the space inside the solid skin as you; and the space outside as not you. Step III Experience the skin boundary as made of condensed space. Step IV Experience \"inside\" space, \"outside\" space, and the \"condensed\" space of the skin as the same substance, space. Step V Notice the only thing that separates the \"inner space\" called you from the outer space called \"not you,\" is the condensed space or our defined boundary. This experience can open the doorway for us to look at the boundary. In Quantum Consciousness Einstein was quoted as saying, \"Everything is made of emptineSs and form is condensed emptiness.\" In terms of the skin boundary then, the boundary is condensed space. Tao of Chaos Exercise #8 Eyes Closed Step I Experience your skin as a solid. Step II Notice the space inside the solid skin as you; and the space outside as not you. Step III Experience the space as the same substance, space. Step IV Notice the only thing that separates the \"inner space\" called you from the outer space called \"not you,\" is the solid defined boundary.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Tao of Chaos exercises provide a unique perspective on the concept of self and space. By experiencing the condensed space of our skin boundary and realizing that everything is made of emptiness, we can confront our fear of disappearing and open ourselves to new ways of understanding our place in the universe."
