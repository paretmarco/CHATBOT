  "title": "What were the results of Baron Dupotet's experiments on magnetic somnambulism?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a part of an essay that discusses the phenomenon of magnetic somnambulism and its demonstrations by Baron Dupotet. It describes an experiment that was conducted by Dupotet in the presence of a committee to explore the validity of magnetic somnambulism. The committee tested the magnetizer's ability to create convulsions in a patient's body by pointing fingers towards certain parts. In line with this, the text explains the committee's observations during the experiment, which aimed to prove the existence of magnetic somnambulism.",
  "content": "The committee took advantage of the presence of Baptiste Chamet, already mentioned, to make experiments upon him, for the purpose of elucidating this question. Accordingly, M. Dupotet having placed this person in a state of somnambulism, directed the point of one of his fingers towards those of Chamet, or approximated them with a metallic rod: No convulsive effect was produced. A finger of the magnetizer was again directed towards those of the patient, and there was perceived, in the fore and middle fingers of both hands, a slight motion, similar to that produced by the galvanic pile. Six minutes afterwards, the finger of the magnetizer, directed towards the left wrist of the patient, impressed upon it a complete convulsive motion ; and the magnetizer then informed us, that in five minutes he should do all that he pleased with this man. M. Marc then, placing himself behind the patient, indicated that the magnetizer should endeavour to act upon the fore-finger of the right hand : He directed his own fore-finger towards this part, and the convulsions took place in the left, and in the thigh of the same side.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the experiments conducted by the committee, with the help of Baptiste Chamet, provided insight into the effects of somnambulism and magnetism on the human body. While some convulsive motions were observed, not all manipulations yielded the same results. Further studies may be required to fully comprehend the potential implications of these findings."
