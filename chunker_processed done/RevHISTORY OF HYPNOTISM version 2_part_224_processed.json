  "title": "\"The Concept of Tellurism: Healing Through Earth's Universal Force\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens describe the healing practice of tellurism, which was developed by Dr. Kieser using his unique theories of animal magnetism. Kieser believed that the telluric force, the living activity of the earth, was the most universal force on earth and could be harnessed to heal people. He used various means of magnetizing, such as willpower, hand and finger manipulations, and eye contact, and explained them in detail. Kieser also credited the Schellingian Naturphilosoph Nees von Esenbeck for outlining his theory. The text emphasizes the importance of being grounded during magnetism or hypnotherapy to enhance results. An example of tellurism is provided, which involves positive and negative manipulations directed by the nature of the disease and its symptoms.",
  "content": "Kieser gives also ‘neurogamy’ as one of the names of animal magnetism. It is the ‘marriage of the nerves’, that is to say the sensory worlds of the magnetizer and the magnetisee come together.108 This is an interesting concept and put attention on the strict contact between magnetizer and magetisee, when, during the magnetic induction, they entangle each other and higher phenomena are possible. Be very earthed (grounded) when you do magnetism or even standard hypnotherapy. You will enhance your results. An exemple of Kieser’s Tellurism The operation is generally performed with the hands only, which are moved, according to the rules of tellurism, in particular directions, from the head to the extremities, resting now and then on the different plexus, or, in case of local disease, on the affected part. The manipulations are of two kinds, positive and negative—exciting and calming; some more or less so. The tellurist is directed therein by the nature of the disease, and by the symptoms, which manifest themselves in many forms. Many of these movements are founded upon physiological principles; others have been discovered by somnambulists: and a few are merely traditional.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while animal magnetism and tellurism have interesting concepts, it is important to remain grounded when practicing these techniques, especially in conjunction with other therapies. The tellurist's talent, perseverance, and discrimination are crucial to success, and patients should avoid allowing anti-telluric doctors to interfere with their treatment. Ultimately, the cessation of visible effects serves as a scientific criterion for determining the appropriate duration of treatment."
