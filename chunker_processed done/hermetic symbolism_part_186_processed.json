  "first_phrase": "This section of the text delves deeper into the symbolic meanings behind the objects present in the image described earlier. The themes of spiritual truth, compassion for one's neighbor, and alchemy all come together. The writer explains the importance of understanding these symbols which reflect the undying tradition of the mysterious book of the great Revealer, and the alchemical process of the Philosophical Egg. The text shows how these symbols are related to the neophyte's symbolic death and separation of fine from the dense, essential for regeneration.",
  "content": "They are endlessly renewed throughout the ages, mental phantoms that serve as vehicles for this undying Tradition, independent of the memories of men or of physical documents, that is written in ethereal characters in the mysterious book of the great Revealer. The remaining symbols to examine are more typical of alchemy, like for example the ovoid vase that the Virgin holds in her right hand. This is the Philosophical Egg, or put in another way, the vessel of ature in which the operations of the Great Work are carried out, leading to the birth of the Philosophical Child whose destiny is â€œto enrich and perfect his brothers. The Subject of the Work is closed inside the Egg after having been carefully chosen, cleaned of any foreign bodies that may have accidentally become stuck to its surface. This is the same process, in different terms, as the choice of the prophet?? who removes all of his metal adornments before being closed inside the Chamber of Reflection. The symbolic death of the neophyte corresponds to the putrefaction of the material, which turns black (Earth Test). The aim of the putrid decomposition, an essential phase for all regeneration, is to separate the fine from the dense.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of the Great Work is a symbolic and transformative journey that leads to the birth of the Philosophical Child, representing the perfection and enrichment of humanity. Through the use of alchemical symbols and tests, the material undergoes a process of purification, ultimately achieving the state of perfect whiteness and the exaltation of the sulphuric flame, leading to the Simple Work. This process requires careful selection, putrefaction, separation, and exaltation, symbolizing a journey of personal growth and spiritual development that has been passed down throughout the ages."
