  "title": "\"What is the therapeutic potential of Suggestion in Mesmerism? Case studies of cures by Dr. Elliotson.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of this text, Dr. Elliotson's experiments with mesmerism were discussed, particularly the power of suggestion. In the last 200 tokens, some intriguing examples of these experiments are presented. The cases involve some of Elliotson's patients, including Miss Collins and a lady who was induced to believe herself mad. Despite the promising results of these experiments, resistance to suggestion could occur as demonstrated by a lady who failed to whistle as promised after being induced to sleep.",
  "content": "When awakened she imagined this to be the case, and complained of the disagreeable smell of the inside of the jar, which smell it was found to have. This subject \"when made to promise\" that when awakened she would fancy herself another lady who was present, went to that lady as soon as she was awakened, and took her fancy work from her, and continued to do that work perfectly, although very difficult, and she had not learned to do such fancy work. On another occasion Elliotson induced one of his patients to believe herself mad when she awoke. When he awakened her she was quite out of her mind, and this state he found it very difficult to remove. When mesmerised next day she said she had actually been mad, and felt so still; and when awakened she had hysterical fits and melancholia. She was cured by making her promise, when mesmerised again, that she would forget that she had been mad. \"Resistance\" to Suggestion is illustrated curiously by an incident that Elliotson relates. A lady in the sleep promised to whistle on entering the room next morning, but failed to do so.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Elliotson's experimentation with hypnosis and suggestion revealed a curious insight into the power of the subconscious mind. By understanding and utilizing suggestion, he was able to cure patients of various afflictions, from hysteria to epilepsy. These examples demonstrate the incredible therapeutic potential of hypnotic suggestion, offering hope for those suffering from debilitating conditions."
