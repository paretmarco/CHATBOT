  "title": "\"The Symbol of Life: Understanding the Cross as an Alchemical Ideogram\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the symbolism of the cross, which represents the interaction of opposites and the active working on the passive to create life. The author also highlights the combination of signs and symbols in the ideogram of the celestial virgin, personification of the highest spirituality, and contrasts it with the Beast of the Apocalypse or the Python. In the final 200 tokens, the author discusses a 17th-century wooden sculpture of the Virgin of the Sacristy, which shows good judgment in the application of traditional symbolism. They also touch upon the principle of dematerialization and ascent contrasted with the Instinctive Soul.",
  "content": "The Spanish artist has shown good judgement in his application of traditional symbolism. If we search for this original base in our own personalities, we will recognise that which our fathers called the Intellectual Soul, which tends to separate us from the material world39, raising us up and spiritualising us. In opposition to this principle of dematerialisation and ascent we have Venus , the Instinctive Soul, which continuously tempts the spirit to descend into the material plane to take bodily form. In summary, the signs and are combined in , the ideogram of the celestial virgin, personification of the highest spirituality, Intelligence (Binah) or understanding (Gnosis), as opposed to brutality, lack of intelligence, lack of understanding or stupidity, which are represented by the Beast of the Apocalypse, the Python or the Dragon, whose blind rage is impotent against the serenity of the Sovereign of the spiritual realm. This monster is a kind of sphynx that sprang forth from the four elements. The front half of its body is a lion that spews fire from its mouth (Earth and Fire), but it has wings (Air) and the rest of it is a water-dwelling animal (Water).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Spanish artist's use of traditional symbolism serves as a reminder of the duality inherent in our nature, between our intellectual and instinctive souls. Through the powerful symbolism of the celestial virgin and the Beast of the Apocalypse, we are reminded that the force of thought and the power of logic can triumph over all brutality and base matter."
