  "title": "The Fascination Process: Curing through Symptoms and \"Void\" State",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of \"fascination\" has been discussed, which refers to a state of trance induced by external factors or internal mental mechanisms. The text explains that this state of being can be transcended by intervention through ideas or concepts that beset the person. Another method is to contact the symptoms directly which can be termed as \"curing through the symptom\". The article highlights re-enacting the problem itself can help to increase the efficacy and rapidity of the process. In the following 200 tokens, the concept of \"curing through the symptom\" will be discussed in more detail, and its effectiveness will be evaluated.",
  "content": "The process is termed by some people “curing through the symptom”. Through the patient’s total concentration on his symptom, in fact, we can carve out a path allowing us to talk with that part of the brain which generates such symptom. We thereby give effect to a mechanism which some healers have already resorted to, namely, \"utilizing the crisis as a cure\".1 What at that point helps the efficacy and, in particular, the rapidity of the process, is the re-enactment of the problem itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, \"curing through the symptom\" is a mechanism that allows the patient to experience the symptom and re-enact the problem that helps to switch on processes in the right hemisphere of the brain. This results in eradicating traumas without drugs, as proven by Elizabeth Phelps' research. Utilizing this approach can help achieve a state of void without the existence of such symptoms, providing a useful benefit for individuals dealing with various health issues."
