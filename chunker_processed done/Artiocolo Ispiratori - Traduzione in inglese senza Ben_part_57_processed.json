  "title": "\"The Battle Over Magnetism: A Journey Through History\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about a commission appointed by the Academy that endorsed the re-examination of magnetism despite opposition. The opponents deployed strange arguments to halt the course of magnetism, but the commission favored the re-examination. The commission's decision was based on the belief that no scientific judgment should be absolute and irrevocable. After six years of research, the commission declared in its report that magnetism can triumph over diseases that defy conventional therapies, thus officially recognizing magnetism as a science. This concluding section explores the commission's verdict in detail.",
  "content": "One of the remarkable reasons it adduced as the basis for supporting such opinion was its declaration that « the judgment passed in 1784» by the commissioners mandated by the King to examine animal magnetism should in no way derogate from the need to carry out a new examination, since in the field of sciences no judgment whatsoever should be taken as being absolute and irrevocable in nature». On 14 February 1826, the aforesaid opinion was adopted with a favourable vote of thirty-five to twenty-five, as a result of which, on the 25th day of the selfsame month, a new commission was vested with the duty to conduct a renewed examination of magnetism. After a six-year period of studies and conscientious researches, along with a large number of corroborating facts, the commission, in its report drawn up in June 1831, declared that magnetic action had the ability to triumph over diseases which were impregnable to the most vigorous therapies. The existence of the science of magnetism was thus officially recognized by virtue of this favourable formal report.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the debate between ruling academia and alternative therapeutic methods may continue, the official recognition of animal magnetism's ability to conquer diseases resistant to traditional therapy is a significant milestone. The scientific approach to animal magnetism, as analyzed in our document, sheds light on why conflicting opinions exist, and shows how the theory of Mesmer shares similarities with the current formulation of quantum theory applied to human sciences."
