  "title": "\"Dynamic Knowledge: Separating the Elements for Presence and Clarity\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of dynamic knowledge of the four elements and its exercises. In this last part, our focus turns to the \"Separation of the Elements,\" which involves perceiving sensory realities, emotions, actions, and thoughts as belonging to different dimensions. By increasing presence and awareness to one's body, we can slowly break automatic mechanisms and separate these elements. Exercise 11 \"Continuous Presence\" provides a simple yet powerful method to achieve this goal. The symbol of this separation is the cross of the elements inside the wheel of the elements.",
  "content": "For example, a very simple method to inaugurate and develop such a state is by gradually increasing the presence to one’s own body. In order for you to attain such objective, you should constantly maintain awareness of one part of your own selves. This extremely simple exercise yields very powerful results. In that manner, you begin to be conscious and thus to prevent emotional states, thoughts and so on from becoming confused with the body. Exercise 11 Continuous presence Every day you should maintain, as long as possible, awareness of one part of the body, whether you are talking, moving around, etc. Enforcing such a division will lead, step by step, to the ability to “break the automatic mechanisms” which relate emotions to external elements, thoughts to emotions, and images to actions94. The symbol of such a separation is the cross of the elements + which is situated inside the symbol of the wheel of the elements we have seen earlier.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing continuous presence through awareness of one part of the body is a simple exercise that yields powerful results in preventing emotions, thoughts, and images from becoming confused with the body. This exercise can lead to the ability to break automatic mechanisms and separate the elements within ourselves, as supported by modern quantistic research. Being multidimensional, it is essential to maintain awareness of our unique selves to attain the desired state of consciousness."
