  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the concept of magnetism and how it can aid in faster healing and aid control of inflammation. We look at the works of Baron of Reichenbach and the Durville brothers, who developed theories on human magnetism and positive and negative od. Furthermore, the concept of being grounded or 'Tellurism' was introduced by Dr. Kieser, which is undervalued in most modern healing technologies. We see from our experience that performing hypnotherapy when grounded can enhance and accelerate results.",
  "content": "In Indian philosophy for example the two energies represented by ida and pingala create a central energy when they merge. For the hypnotherapist interested in Indian techniques, Reichenbach is a very interesting ‘bridge’ (and even more so is the work of the Durville brothers) Polarities can have an interesting interpretation even from a quantistic point of view. Kieser - Tellurism and grounding in the earth for successful healing A very interesting idea of magnetism is the concept of being grounded. This concept was named ‘Tellurism’ by dr. Kieser106 but his ideas were not well understood by many of his contemporaries. What he tells us is instead very interesting because in experiments with animals in order to perform healing it is very important to “feel one with the ground”107 . We can think that dr. Kieser stood with something very important which is undervalued in most modern healing technologies. Our experience instead shows that performing even standard hypnotherapy when grounded will enhance and accelerate your results.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the concepts of Tellurism and grounding in the earth into hypnotherapy could be a valuable tool for healing. Dr. Kieser's ideas emphasize the importance of feeling connected to the ground and recognizing the reciprocal action between living organisms and the earth. By implementing these principles, one may enhance and accelerate their healing results in ways modern techniques have yet to understand fully."
