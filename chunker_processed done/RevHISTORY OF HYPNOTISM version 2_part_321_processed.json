  "title": "\"What is the Magnetiser technique and how can it induce deep sleep at a distance?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the practice of Magnetism and how an Operator induces deep sleep in a subject without even touching them. The Operator stands at a distance and performs passes from above downwards, activating the subject's senses and extending their fingers towards the eyes and epigastric region. The text also highlights the importance of the Operator changing their breathing and moving away from the subject. Despite the distance, the subject continues to react as if the Operator were near them. This highlights the power of quantum entanglement and the Operator's ability to induce a sense of mystery in their subject.",
  "content": "On raising the hand, he should, as prescribed by Deleuze, turn his back towards the Subject. 7. In order to induce deep sleep at the first Operation, he Magnetises the head, by means of long descending passes, or strokes, by the imposition of the hands at the height of the forehead, when a few passes over the legs and knees render the Magnetisation complete. 8. Go to the farthest place of the room and change breathing. Test for change in breathing in your subject. This last point is very powerful. Removing ourselves from the immediate contact with the person, we create the condition for developing a very powerful sensitivity. This sensitivity translates into an effort of the senses for keeping contact with the person in a way that increases at distance, it becomes more and more mysterious (even if we justify it with the concept of quantum entanglement). What is most striking is that people react at a distance as if the operator were near them. Most of the time, when we do this in our seminars, it is also the subjective impression and people say that they hadn’t even noticed the operator distancing himself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the prescribed techniques of Deleuze, utilizing Magnetization, and incorporating the distance technique, practitioners of the Dupotet’s cure may experience powerful results in their treatment, as evidenced by the successful treatment of Lucy Clark's epilepsy by Baron Dupotet de Sennevoy."
