  "title": "\"Unlocking Inner Power through Hemispheric Exercises\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned that developing inner power requires consistent alignment of the two halves of our brain, which can be achieved through proper spinal alignment and grounding. To maintain flexibility and avoid tension in the torso and neck, simple exercises like body rotation and head rotation are recommended. Now, we are ready to dive into exercises that focus on hamonizing the two hemispheres of our brain. This technique has been around since pre-Roman times and is still known and practiced by many today. The Etruscans even represented the eye on many everyday objects. Let's explore these \"exercises for hemispheres\" and the power of gaze that they unlock.",

Probably a school of this type, connected with the development of the power of gaze, is probably present in Italy even since pre-Roman eras, which would explain how there are still many people who know and practice this technique. The Etruscans had in fact represented the eye on many everyday objects.",
