  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Understanding Energy and Associations.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of energy in psychology and how it translates through interactions between individuals. It explains the role of solidified energy in creating impressions in one's psyche and how these impressions develop into self-organized chains of energy that have a life of their own. The previous section discusses the use of structural family therapy to address chaos in families where parents deny the problem. In this final section, the author delves into the intricacies of energy in human communication and how it shapes our associations and perceptions. The text features concepts such as self-similarity and chains of events, and mentions the work of Sigmund Freud.",
  "content": "On the other hand, if \"I like you\" has meant something negative such as Mom saying \"I like you\" in order to get you to behave a certain way, then the energy gets solidified and a different impression (solidified energy) \"pops-up\" in your mind of being used or a betrayal of trust. Simply stated, when energy gets solidified, it forms impressions in the psyche. Through interactions it seems that energy gets solidified and develops meanings. Each meaning creates similar meanings because, as mentioned earlier, universes are self-similar and strongly attracted to one another. This is how associations cling to one another. For example, Freud said \"all traumas are organized in chains of earlier, similar events.\" In this case, if someone hurt you in 1992 it will cling to all similar events and look like a chain. It seems that there is a strange attraction of similar associations, as Freud said, which occurs and looks like a chain. Once this self-organized chain of energy gets solidified it develops a life of its own, and an energy of its own, arising and subsiding in a person's consciousness by its own will.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our interactions with others and the meaning we give to the energy exchanged can lead to the formation of self-organized chains of similar associations in our psyche. These chains, when solidified, develop a life and energy of their own, appearing as chaos in our consciousness. It is the definition we place on energy that gives it boundaries, and understanding this can help us navigate our internal world with greater clarity and awareness."
