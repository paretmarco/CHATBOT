  "title": "\"The Practice of Presence: Attaining Higher Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this practical philosophy text, we explore the concept of presence as a state of direct consciousness of the Universe, facilitating attention and mental freedom. The last 200 tokens illustrate how we can overcome the dichotomy between \"thought\" and \"being\" through presence, leading us to a higher state of consciousness. This section examines how the constant flow of thoughts can hinder our ability to be present and act intentionally, and introduces techniques to rediscover our inward power.",
  "content": "The Presence, in fact, helps us overcome the dichotomy between “thought” and “being”. We can arrive at a more elevated state of consciousness in which we might be able to be aware of the flow of our thoughts while simultaneously “being”. Usually that does not take place. We are inclined not to be conscious of the fact that we are forever engaged in thinking. The constant flow of thoughts crossing our minds leaves little room for inner quiet and for our own selves. Too often we display a tendency to react rather than to act, and we thus let ourselves be carried along by the strong current of life. The techniques we teach represent a path we can tread to learn how to be ourselves, as well as to rediscover where our inward power is truly located.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing self-observation with a sense of concern and acceptance, we can remove obstacles and release energies to elevate our consciousness. The focal point exercise can be an effective tool to help us rediscover our true inward power and be our authentic selves, leading us towards freedom and intelligence."
