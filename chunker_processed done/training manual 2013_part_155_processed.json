  "title": "\"Breathing and Visualization Exercise for Relaxation and Focus\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about two exercises useful for magnetizing oneself. In this section, we will discuss exercise three, not necessary for magnetizing, but useful nonetheless. We are cautioned from the outset not to concentrate on money, but instead to use a copper penny or an ordinary cent as an object on which to fix our gaze. The purpose is to steady our eyes and focus our breath, which will aid us in improving our voice, strengthening the larynx, and enhancing our understanding, intelligence, and wisdom.",
  "content": "Place on the floor in front of you, about one foot from the toes of your shoes, some dull object, say a copper penny -- an ordinary cent. Not that we intend to concentrate upon money, not at all. It is not dollars that we are after in this work, but sense. For that reason we select a cent, as it will be the least suggestive of money matters. By sitting down and concentrating on money we find that it will not come unless we get a move on us to get it, if to get money be our aim. Few can get anything they desire that money will buy, --- but health, understanding, intelligence, wisdom and all the attributes of a nobler existence cannot be bought. They can be acquired by diligent work and concentrating upon their true nature. Steady the eyes upon this cent before you, not concentrating upon it, but simply using it as an object to steady your eyes upon.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this exercise of concentrating on a dull object and focusing on the breath can aid in achieving a sense of calm and clarity. Through the diligent practice of relaxation and concentration, we can acquire attributes such as wisdom, intelligence, and better health without solely relying on money. Remember to always keep a steady gaze and hold the spinal column firm while taking deep breaths."
