  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the second symbol of the exercise - the upper dimension, which is represented by an early development of mercury. The exercise involves awakening the serpent power through detachment from physical senses and the projection of energy accompanied by a specific sound or mantra. To dominate the polarities, we can use a balancing breathing exercise that alternates between inhaling from the right nostril and exhaling from the left and vice versa. Ernest Rossi observed that this alternation of rhythms matches the activation of the two cerebral hemispheres, with the right nostril linked to activity and the left to passivity.",
  "content": "This will be fixed later by subsequent repetitions of the exercise and its evocation through memory, even without water. 81 Breathing to dominate the polarities Our breathing, without we notice it, passes alternately from one nostril to the other. The researcher Ernest Rossi82 observed that this alternation of rhythms follows specific rhythms and matches the different activation of the two cerebral hemispheres. Symbolically, the right nostril is linked to activity, while the left to passivity. A balancing exercise is alternating breathing in, namely the inhale with one nostril and exhale with the other. breathing exercise. 1) Inhale right while holding (closing) the left nostril and fill the lungs 1) Exhale left holding (closing) the right nostril. 2) Re-inhale to the left keeping closed the right nostril 3) Exhale right while closing the left nostril 4) Keep on doing it You can add a particular respiratory rhythm in the exercise above, or run it just as well.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating this breathing exercise into your daily routine can help you achieve a more balanced state of mind and increase your overall sense of centeredness. With practice and repetition, you can master this technique and use it to regulate your breathing and dominate the polarities between activity and passivity, ultimately bringing a sense of peace and stability to your life."
