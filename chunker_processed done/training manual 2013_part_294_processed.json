  "title": "\"Hot Water and Cold Water Exercise for Perception Control\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on the importance of being able to build our own reality instead of living in a reality defined by external concepts. The author highlights the \"magnetic man\" who has the ability to create his own world. The major exercise called \"hot water and cold water\" is presented as a way to access each symbol through sensorial experience. The exercise helps to modify perception and attain control over one's own perceptions. Ultimately, the exercise has a strong symbolic value, representing the non-conditioning of one's being from external factors.",
  "content": "1) Put a basin with cold water to the right 2) Put a basin with hot water to the left 3) Put a hand in the basin of cold water and a hand in warm water basin and at the same time try to reverse the perceptions. Some will totally. Others will only partly. Anyway, make the maximum effort and act without using the imagination (so you do not have e.g. to imagine ice) but the willpower only. Note, it could seem it was you heating the water. Then you will see that you actually have achieved control over your perceptions. Exercise: With breathing Perform the same exercise again, but holding breath The exercise has a strong symbolic value. The first symbol of the exercise: the non conditioning With this exercise our being is no more influenced from temperatures of \"waters\" (symbolized by an arrow that goes down ? )78.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this exercise demonstrates how willpower can be used to gain control over perceptions and break free from conditioning. By combining breath work with the simple act of placing hands in hot and cold water, one can tap into an elevated state of consciousness symbolized by the serpent power and connect with a higher dimension beyond the constraints of earthly limitations. With practice, mastery over the mind and body can be achieved."
