  "title": "\"Mastering Polarities with Hot Water/Cold Water Exercise\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains how the symbology of a winged deity represents the power of breathing in relation to the eye and energy represented by the sword. The author also explores the dual aspect of this energy and the exercise that follows, which involves working on both physical and energetic levels to extract power from the meeting of two different aqueous energies and the energy of breathing. In the last part, the author introduces a major exercise called \"hot water and cold water,\" which works to modify perceptions and reverse the physical polarity of perception of the water element. This exercise helps to overcome polarities, a major obstacle in developing basic energy and building one's world and reality as a magnetic man.",
  "content": "Polarities are also expressions of a dualistic vision of the world, a product of our mind and our ego that has learned to interpret the sensory data according to pre-established patterns. How many people complain constantly! Being influenced by world distinctions, beautiful/ugly, pleasant/unpleasant etcâ€¦ this means virtually to live in a reality built from the outside and based on the concepts. The magnetic man builds instead his world and his reality. Moreover, the first point where we must surpass us is in ourselves. We must be able to build our world and live our reality. A way to access each symbol is represented by the sensorial experience. A major exercise called \"hot water and cold water\"77. It consists in modify perceptions, to reverse the physical polarity of perception of the water element. This exercise works physiologically to hemispheric level, since each hand is tied to a different hemisphere. When we operate at the same time on two hands then we arrive at a new and higher sense of unity. Exercise: Hot water and cold water.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding that polarities are a creation of our mind and ego, and that we can build our own reality, we can access deeper levels of unity within ourselves. The \"hot water and cold water\" exercise is a practical way to challenge our perceptions, and with time and practice, it can lead to a higher sense of unity and self-mastery."
