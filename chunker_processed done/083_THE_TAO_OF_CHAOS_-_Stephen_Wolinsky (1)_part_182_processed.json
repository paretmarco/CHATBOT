  "title": "\"Reabsorbing I-dentities Back into Essence: The Quantum Approach\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed how personality structures are formed to defend against the emptiness, unknowingly resisting the gateway into Essence. The goal is not to change the personality but to reabsorb I-dentities and their goals back into the personal Essence. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces the concept of Essence, which is beyond personality and capable of reordering chaos and resistance. The author proposes the reabsorption of underlying states, including lies we tell ourselves, in order to operate from Essence rather than I-dentity.",
  "content": "Essence: The Organizer of Chaos Essence is beyond personality because it was there before the body and nervous system developed and could notice and differentiate self from other. Therefore, Essence becomes the ultimate organizer of chaos. Essence, that vast personal emptiness, when allowed, can reabsorb the personality back into itself. Fortunately for us, Essence leaves a trace in the body. Although this trace of emptiness is resisted in the body, it is this Essence that the chaos and resistance to chaos can be reordered back into. In order to do this we examine our I-dentities and personality fearlessly so that I-dentities are completely reabsorbed. This allows the practitioner of the Quantum Approach to operate from Essence rather than I-dentity. To do this I will propose I-dentity structures or underlying states that need to be reabsorbed. We must keep in mind that it is not that which we know about that is the problem. Rather, it is that which we do not know about which is the problem. Lies Lies we tell ourselves cannot be absorbed into Essence. Stated another way, we must confront and tell the truth about the lies we tell ourselves in order for I-dentities to be reabsorbed back into Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by examining and reabsorbing our I-dentities and telling the truth about the lies we tell ourselves, we can operate from Essence instead of I-dentity. This allows us to reorder the chaos and resistance to chaos within us and become the ultimate organizer of our lives. So let us fearlessly dive into ourselves and embrace our Essence to live a fulfilling life."
