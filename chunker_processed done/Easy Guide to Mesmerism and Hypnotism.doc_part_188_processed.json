  "title": "\"Mesmeric Healing: The Power of Intention and Conditions of Cure\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author discussed the mesmeric influence that one exerts on others simply by interacting with them. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores how mesmerism works on water, pillules, and even on the diet of the patient. The author also talks about the conditions of cure, which are important for the art of magnetic healing. In essence, the author believes that faith and suggestion are integral to mesmerism, but that should not deter the mesmerist from their labours.",
  "content": "In that case mesmerised pillules will be found useful. Hold the pure and innocuous sugar pillules in your hands, and roll them in the hollow of, or between your hands, and “breathe upon” them before bottling. I use the ordinary homoeopathic pillule, as it is before medication. Bandages or belts for the waist, soles, or socks, for the feet I have found of great service. Even the diet of the patient, as well as the water he drinks can be imbued with this communicable life-force with benefit to the patient... I do not think it possible to eliminate faith and suggestion from mesmeric operation; in toto, certainly not as long as we are dealing with: beings capable of exercising faith or being influenced by suggestion. Shall the preacher or the physician or the teacher-cease their particular labours because these subtle forces act so powerfully with those with whom they have to do? I think not. Neither should the mesmerist. CONDITIONS OF CURE I cannot leave this part of the subject—to me the most interesting and, I believe, the most important—without pointing out some auxiliaries to this, the magnetic healing art.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while mesmerism has its benefits, it is important to also consider the favorable conditions for health and recovery. A healthy lifestyle, suitable occupation, and positive mindset can all contribute to a successful cure. Mesmerized pillules, along with other supportive measures, can aid in the healing process, but ultimately, it is up to the patient to maintain healthy habits to sustain their health long-term."
