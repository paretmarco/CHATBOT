  "title": "\"Chair breath exercise for calmness and mental clarity\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the text describes a powerful exercise that can bring tranquility and calmness to the mind, as well as open up \"realms of untold joy.\" The exercise involves inhaling as deeply as possible, retaining the breath, and gradually releasing the grip on the back of a chair. The sensations one may experience include a warm feeling from electric force generated in the nervous system and cool magnetic circles emanating from the soul. However, one must not overdo the exercise, which cannot be done more than three times a day for three minutes each time. If you feel the chair move or your knees rise, stop the exercise.",
  "content": "You need not feel alarmed over the peculiar sensation starting at the navel and distributing itself over the spinal region in an upward movement to the top of the head as well as downward to the lower extremities of the body. That peculiar warmth is caused by the generation of electric force in the nervous system, and that cool, fanning sensation felt about the body is the magnetic circles emanating from the inmost soul. This position will bring a tranquillity and calmness over the mind and open up realms of untold joy. Yet what it will do for you remains for you to experience. But you must not overdo it because of the great benefits you are deriving from this exercise and others. You must not think the more the better. It is a very powerful exercise. As soon as you begin to feel the chair move before you, and your knees show the tendency to get above the floor, release the hands at once from the chair and stop the exercise for that day.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating this exercise into your routine can lead you to a world of wisdom and consciousness, but remember, it is a powerful exercise. Overdoing it may hinder your progress. So, approach it mindfully, take it easy and experience its healing powers for yourself."
