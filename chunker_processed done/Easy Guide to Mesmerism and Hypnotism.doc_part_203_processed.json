  "title": "Mesmeric power and Medical experiments: A Strange Tale",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author describes their experiments in mesmeric power, including the ability to control the arterial circulation of a Glasgow sensitive. In this final section, the author continues to discuss their experiments and the potential explanations for the observed phenomena. The author also describes a second experiment in which they allowed medical professionals to test the subject's insensibility. The author's claims regarding the effects of mesmeric power on the subject and the medical professionals are explored.",
  "content": "I might add that the subject was in a deep unconscious sleep; the medical men were apparently wide-awake. The commonsense conclusion would be that the subject was mesmerised and not they; and that they, being wide awake and in the full possession of their senses, had testified to what they had seen. This experiment has been frequently repeated. The second experiment was somewhat similar in character to the above. The medical gentlemen on the committee asked my permission to test the insensibility of the subjects. It was proposed to place a hot spirit-tube suddenly to different muscles to see if they flexed under the test, and thereby indicate the presence of nervous sensitiveness or consciousness. I made no objection to this. There was some difficulty in getting a spirit test-tube, so, to prevent unnecessary waiting, a gentleman lent a gold scarf-pin, and a lady her brooch to the committee. I made the subject's arm rigid in a horizontal position.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the experiments conducted on subjects in deep unconscious sleep suggest that mesmerism or suggestion can induce insensibility and prevent any pain or consciousness. These experiments, frequently repeated, demonstrate the power of the mind and highlight the importance of careful observation and testing in medical research."
