  "title": "\"Chaos Theory Applied to Psychology: Creating Order from Disorder\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author applies Chaos Theory to psychology and demonstrates how repeating a pattern can create a new beautiful order, even in uncomfortable or chaotic energy patterns. The example given is of a compulsion or an obsessive thought and how the author helped a woman to intentionally add energy to an energetic loop by visualizing her husband in the room. As she iterated this loop, she added the energy of awareness and detached herself, creating a new order in the process.",
  "content": "For example, Barbara, a woman I was working with recently, said that whenever she saw her lover she would give up her power and feel very weak. What I asked her to do was to repeat or iterate the energetic pattern that happens with her husband intentionally adding energy to the circular loop. In this case I had her create an image of her husband in the room, visualizing her husband in the room, which is an energy flow. Then have the energy flowing from him in a looping fashion to her feeling of powerlessness. I asked her to create this loop again and again in a looping fashion. What occurred as I had her do this was that she added to the loop the energy of awareness. This process created a new order as she got more and more detached and she observed with the energetic pattern which seemed to have an energy circle or cycle or loop of its own. See Illustration #2. 114(.181RA-110N w 2 POWERFU1, PE-I-Ani.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by intentionally repeating and amplifying the energetic pattern that caused Barbara to feel powerless, she was able to break the cycle and observe it with detachment. This allowed for a new order to form, resulting in a beautiful and meaningful Mandala. It's a reminder that we have the power to shift our own energy and create positive change in our lives."
