  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, we get an insight into the seven types of human personalities based on the interaction of the Spirit, Soul, and Body, and how they affect one's dreams, ambitions, and overall character. The previous sections discussed the Conqueror, the Egoist, and the Altruist, and now we explore the seventh type, the Strictly Normal Individual, who embodies a perfect balance of the three elements. The author suggests that while it's important to specialize, we shouldn't stray too far from the human norm. Instead, we should learn from those who have achieved a happy equilibrium and try to model our own character on theirs to strike the right balance.",
  "content": "Tenderness, goodwill and affection overwhelm the central I and it is forgotten; ambition turns to emotion, and the active impulses are moderated, to the benefit of the organism. Dreams are altruistic and the light of great idealism surrounds this personality, which shines with generosity. The Strictly Normal Individual There are only six types, but all of them come together around the seventh type, which is the ideally balanced man, the Adamic Model of Man, in whom the Spirit , the Soul and the Body or Sulphur , Mercury and Salt are perfectly combined. Individual human beings can come close to this type, of which a generalizaiton would be injurious, because it is right that we should all be different and that we should specialise according to the task that falls to us. However, we should not stray too far from the human norm, as if we became excessively differentiated in that regard we should be inhuman. In order to strike the right chord we must avoid all the distortions of exaggeration, and try to correct our character, modelling it on those close to us whose wisdom, or happy equilibrium, is evident.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, striving towards achieving a balanced personality is crucial for the benefit of our overall wellbeing. While there are only six types of individuals, being the strictly normal person is the ideal, and we should aim to model our characters based on those who exhibit wisdom and balance. Although not absolute, these character determinations can assist us in discovering analogies and identifying morbid imbalances, ultimately leading to a healthier fulfiling life."
