  "title": "Animal Hypnosis and the Power of Non-Verbal Stimulation",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of animal hypnosis, in which animals can be induced into a trance-like state by specific non-verbal stimuli. The author highlights the differences between traditional hypnotism, as described by Coates, and modern hypnosis, which places less emphasis on the hypnotist's willpower. They argue that some hypnotists, like Abbe Faria, rely on their own confidence and belief to induce hypnosis through touch. The text also differentiates between hypnotism and fascination, which is another physiological state. Additionally, it discusses the concept of vital fluid or animal magnetism, which can be misleading.",
  "content": "Nonetheless he did affirm that some people who do not react to the fluid can be brought in hypnosis just by touching them in a specific way. But this is only HIS confidence and WILL. He believes some touches have a physiological effect, therefore he will see the occurrence of hypnotic effects. We believe that when Coates speaks of hypnotists who think they use psychology, and in reality they use will power, Coates was referring to people such as Abbe Faria. We believe that by many “scientific” hypnotists denying the power of the “life fluid,” they have in reality restored it: they say that the hypnotist must be sure of himself and he must not have any doubt. Difference between Hypnotism and Fascination Finally, sometimes which is referred to by past authors as hypnotism is even yet another state; it is a state which we could call “fascination.” This state of fascination has, just as Mesmerism, physiological aspects. In fascination the mind is blocked, and the will of the hypnotist acts directly on the patient who is in a state of being there – not being there. Energy (Vital Fluid) theory Another misleading term is Vital Fluid, Animal Magnetism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the various states and theories around hypnotism and fascination can help us become more aware of the subtle ways in which we connect with others. While there may be different beliefs and approaches, cultivating a sense of harmony with nature and life can enhance the effectiveness of any practice."
