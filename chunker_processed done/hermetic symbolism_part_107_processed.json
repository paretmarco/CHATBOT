  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the importance of preserving one's vital fluid and staying young in soul and spirit. In this concluding part, we delve into the concept of magnetism and the Work of the Wise. The healing power of magnetism lies in the vital water that can be shared between individuals. The permeability of the corporeal crust determines one's sensitivity to this fluid. Finally, the Philosophers' Stone, the ultimate goal of alchemy, is composed of purified Salt, coagulated Mercury, and highly active Sulphur. This is the Work of the Wise, and the element of Salt is crucial in its attainment.",
  "content": "When this happens, it can cause extraordinary and sometimes immediate effects. Sensitivity to magnetism depends on the permeability of the corporeal crust. The “subjects” are permeable, hence their surprising reactions to treatment. Everyone can try to make themselves open to good influences, though this does not entail abandoning oneself in any way to the dominion of another person. It is this spirit that shapes the Adepts of Hermetism as well as those of Freemasonry. The Work of the Wise The Philosophers’ Stone is composed of a Salt that has been fully purified, which then works to coagulate the volatile Mercury, fixating it and then joining to a burning Sulphur that has become highly active. The Work is therefore composed of three phases: Purification of Salt Coagulation of Mercury Fixation of Sulphur As Salt is contained in the Philosophical Matter, that is the element which must be obtained in the first instance. Salt is everywhere and costs nothing, despite being of incalculable worth.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Work of the Wise, which is the process of creating the Philosophers' Stone, consists of three phases: purification of salt, coagulation of mercury, and fixation of sulfur. To begin with, the material to be used must be found, which is attainable through uncovering salt. Once found, the process involves cleaning the material, sealing it in a chamber of reflection, and undergoing the necessary steps to create the Philosophers' Stone. With dedication and perseverance, anyone can attempt to become an adept in Hermetism or Freemasonry."
