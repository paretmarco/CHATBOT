  "title": "\"The Power of Instant Fascination: Eradicating Ailments\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed how Ezio F. noticed an unnoticed second door in Prof. Di Pisa's study. In this concluding section, the author sheds light on the revolutionary methodology of Instant Fascination, which was invented by Erminio from Pisa. The author describes how this unique method can instantly relieve physical ailments, and how Erminio amazed a crowd of 300 people in Milan by using the technique. The author also explains that the technique is simple yet effective, and provides evidence to support the claims.",
  "content": "He was its sole practitioner throughout Italy. Once he gave us an astounding demonstration of it in the presence of three hundred people in Milan. He did so by working on each of those persons in attendance for some twenty seconds, thereby producing results which in most cases endured through the following days, while in other instances they actually proved conclusive in their effect. In certain cases, a single intervention is enough to engender a permanent result. In other instances, it is necessary to apply the technique twice or thrice in a row, whereupon a more than highly satisfactory overall percentage of 97% of healed people will be actualized. At our institute, we keep a number of videos which corroborate what we have stated in this connection. The methodology is rather simple.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this fascinating demonstration of a simple yet effective technique reinforces the power of the mind in healing the body. With a high success rate of up to 97%, this innovative approach to pain management is worth exploring and could offer hope to those suffering from chronic pain or seeking a non-invasive alternative to traditional medical treatments."
