  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the concept of mineral qualities having a spirit and the speculative nature of hermetism were introduced. Additionally, the globe topped with a cross was discussed as the symbol of imperial power, representing the control over the Spirit of the World. The text concludes by addressing the signs found in alchemical texts, where they refer to materially active substances like Blue Vitriol and Green Vitriol that represent passive and aggressive polarizations of animal vitality, respectively. The signs carry implicit destructive tendencies that can lead to abnormal mental-corporal breakdowns.",
  "content": "The school of Paracelsus calls this agent by the name Astral Light, and it is represented as an invisible irradiation that generates a psychically phosphorescent cloud around our planet. Anyone who knows how to coagulate this fluid into a thickened mass, and then to dissolve this mass again, has achieved dominion over the Spirit of the World and possesses the supreme magical power. One might ask what the signs and mean, when not used in Alchemy. They should refer to materially active substances, like radium. There is an implicit destructive tendency: it is not the soul, but the body that is at stake here; it can perhaps be compared to “subjects” who generate metaphysical phenomena, which are then translated into abnormal mental-corporal breakdowns. We have already come across the sign , which designates Blue Vitriol, or in other words, the passive polarization of animal vitality, in its feminine mode, in contrast to Green Vitirol , which is masculine-aggressive. On the one side there is centripetal attraction, which gathers, retains, saves and condenses the life force energy, in order to use it calmly and economically.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbol of the Astral Light and other alchemical signs may have different interpretations and uses beyond the realm of alchemy, such as referring to materially active substances. The Substance of Life, also known as the Elixir of Life or the Life-Giving Substance, represents an undifferentiated primordial substance that is believed to animate unlimited dynamism and purify the philosophical Gold. Through spagyric methods, it can become an antidote to all poisons."
