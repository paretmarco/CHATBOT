  "title": "\"The Role of Intuition and Light in Human Development\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the concept of intuition and how it relates to the individual's ability to actualize their strengths and faculties. The author explains how light can be used to enhance this process and increase magnetism. In the last section (200 tokens), the author provides an exercise that involves training oneself to remember the visual reflection of light on objects. This exercise is aimed at refining the sensory apparatus and expanding the individual's field of perception. The author mentions the importance of polarized light and mirrors in this context.",
  "content": "In our school, we have carried out a series of corroborating researches concerning its use in order to enhance man.116 Physical light is useful, for example, at the initial stage, for the purpose of assisting in the creation of the mental image of light itself.117 We might then increase magnetism through the sagacious use of white light, whether in its direct or its reflected forms.118 It is possible to attain states of plenitude even without recourse to its actual physical use, but the path would then prove to be far more arduous, and it would in any event still pass through phases in which light appears in a mental form. Exercise 16: Memory of the visual reflection of the light. You should train yourself to look at objects over which light falls, and recollect them in your mind. This light is in fact polarized (A mirror, too, allows us to generate such type of light).",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the use of light in our daily lives can significantly contribute to our overall well-being. While it is possible to attain states of plenitude without its physical use, it may prove to be more challenging. Training ourselves to look at objects over which light falls and memorizing them can help in enhancing our receptive and perceptive polarity of energies. The ancient tradition of using light as a physiological aid has a hidden secret that modern science has yet to uncover."
