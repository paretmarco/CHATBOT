  "title": "The Power of Instantaneous Hypnosis: Exploring Fascination and Healing Techniques",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding tokens, the author describes various instances of a quiet person named Virgilio displaying extraordinary abilities such as telepathic power and medical divination. The author and his companions become interested in Virgilio's powers and decide to become his students to learn the disciplined techniques necessary to attain such powers. In this final section, the author introduces another school of thought on this subject and acknowledges the contribution of the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa, who referred to the power of fascination as \"instantaneous hypnosis.\"",
  "content": "Having intuitively realized that recourse to such technique might have stretched even beyond what we had been witnesses to, and that this power might be used for the additional purpose of making people feel better, we resolved on becoming Virgilio’s students and intimate associates, to whom he could have confided his secrets. We then realized that, in order to attain such power, what is needed is a disciplined work upon one’s own self, which is also grounded on a series of techniques and exercises encompassing self-control as well as self-development and self-improvement. Virgilio is not, however, the only exponent of such school which we owe our knowledge of the subject to. A contribution to the completion of this work was also made by the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa 42. He used to refer to fascination by the term of “instantaneous hypnosis”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of fascination or instantaneous hypnosis can lead to powerful results in making people feel better, but it requires a disciplined approach and a series of techniques and exercises encompassing self-control, self-improvement, and self-development. While Virgilio T. and Prof. Erminio from Pisa were both masters in this area, the latter's deep and enduring healing effects make his approach particularly noteworthy. With dedication and practice, anyone can potentially harness the power of fascination for therapeutic purposes."
