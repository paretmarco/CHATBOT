  "title": "Understanding De Puysegur's Theories on Magnetism",
  "first_phrase": "The text discusses the theories of de Puysegur, who made significant changes to Mesmer's theories on magnetism. De Puysegur simplified the concept of the universal fluid that saturates all bodies, including the human body, which he refers to as an animated electric machine. He believed that one's belief and will, rather than blind belief, were critical to achieving results. The last 200 tokens explain the curative crises, specifically somnambulism that de Puysegur discovered. It describes the calm and peaceful state experienced by the patient instead of violent crises accompanied by cries, sobs and contortions of hysteria.",
  "content": "Further it was better explained that the “belief” was not to be intended as blind belief in the outcome, as otherwise this branch of magnetism would not be called experimental, but instead in belief to the possibilities and capabilities of the magnetizer to get results84. In this way de Puysegur modified the tradition he had received from Mesmer, and simple contact or spoken orders were substituted for the use of the baquet. There were no more violent crises, accompanied by cries, sobs, and the contortions of an attack of hysteria; instead, there was a calm, peaceful, healthy, and composed slumber. This was not a transformed phase of magnetism, but the actual discovery of this state, the honour of which is due to de Puysegur. “Among the curative crises which evolved, the most remarkable of all is that called somnambulism. In these crises, the external senses are alone impregnated with the principle of feeling.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this approach to magnetism brings attention to the power of intention and the possibilities of our own abilities to impart vital energies on ourselves and others. Although different from Mesmer's original theory, de Puysegur's modifications allowed for a peaceful and healthy slumber, which led to the discovery and understanding of somnambulism. By understanding and implementing this theory in our daily lives, we can experience remarkable curative crises and internal knowledge, leading to better health and well-being."
