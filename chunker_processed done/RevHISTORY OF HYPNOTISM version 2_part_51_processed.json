According to another alchemist, Van Helmont, the soul is endowed with a modelling power, which, after having produced an idea, can mould it into substance and shape, and send it far off, propelled and guided by the will. This power, infinite in the Creator, is, of course, limited in his creatures, and may consequently be more or less obstructed by obstacles. Ideas thus clothed in substance, have a physical influence on living beings through the medium of the vital principle; they act with more or less power, in proportion to the energy of the will that sends them forth; and their action may be checked by the resistance of the receiving patient. Some learned men, in Van Helmont's time, thought that the sympathetic power emanated from the stars, but Vanhelmont maintained the contrary. \"I see,\" said he, \" the source of this power in an agent much nearer to ourselves. Ideas are the directing power, and these ideas are produced by charity or good-will.",
