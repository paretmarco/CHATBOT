  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos and the Boundaries of Energy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text \"Chaos and Energy,\" the concept of the self and its relationship with energy is explored. The accumulation of solidified energy forms a person's identity and structures, which are used to explain the external world based on past solidified energy, known as memory. The feeling of chaos occurs when arbitrary boundaries are placed around energy clusters of associations as \"mine\" or \"yours.\" To learn the Tao of Chaos, we must de-label and shift our subjective experience into its true nature- energy. This text draws from Chapter 4 and 5 of \"Quantum Consciousness\" and continues to delve into the relationship between the self, energy, and consciousness.",
  "content": "For this reason, since the solidified energy creates structures and patterns which explain the external world, and since all of these structures are based on past solidified energy, now called memory, the human individual psyche can only see present-time reality in terms of the past solidified energy. The feeling of chaos occurs because we place arbitrary boundaries around ourself and others defining energy clusters of associations as mine and yours. The feelings of chaos bring up feelings and memories of out-of-control, confusion, craziness, which arise out of the terror of disappearance. In order to learn the Tao of Chaos, we must do as was talked about in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I, Chapter 4; namely, de-label. Taking the label off, as we saw in the previous book, helps us to shift our subjective experience into its true nature; namely energy. At this point, for the reader who does not feel fluent in Chapter 4 of Quantum Consciousness, Volume I; please review the exercises until they feel like second nature. â€¢ Assuming that the work is clear, let's move on in the Tao of Chaos and how it relates to energy.",
  "last_phrase": "To learn the Tao of Chaos, it is crucial to de-label and shift our subjective experience into its true nature - energy. The exercises in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I can help achieve this. By recognizing memories and emotions as energy, we can let go of arbitrary boundaries and cultivate a new perspective on present reality. Try the Tao of Chaos Exercises #18 to deepen the practice."
