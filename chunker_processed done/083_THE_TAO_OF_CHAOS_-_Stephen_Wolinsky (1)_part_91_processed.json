  "title": "The Condensed Emptiness of Thought and Feeling in Space.",
  "first_phrase": "The concept of space has always been intriguing and complex for humans to understand. The previous text delves into how space is defined and limited, ultimately causing chaos when boundaries are created. It highlights the interconnectedness of everything and how we define ourselves by the boundaries we create. In the final 200 tokens, the author discusses how thoughts and feelings are condensed emptiness that can only exist in a specific phase of space. If separated from their designated space, they disappear. The author also touches on Quantum Physics' understanding of matter made of space and how everything overlaps and interpenetrates.",
  "content": "For example, I say, \"This is my space, or that is your space\" referring to either the space the body occupies or what you define as your psychological space. When we look at your homes, certain areas of space are defined as used in only a specific way. The kitchen and the stove is the space you cook in, not the space ' pg. 1156, Webster you read in. This definition of space leaves us with boundaries. Why does this cause chaos? Because created boundaries define and hence limit what can occur there. For example, in your skin boundary you may decide anger is not allowed; this causes chaos when another person is angry in your presence. Definitions and Chaos Definitions are markers which define and separate one thing from another. For example, we define \"our\" body by the skin boundary. We determine who we are by where the skin ends. Yet, Quantum Physics has demonstrated to us that matter (the skin boundary) is made of space. Furthermore, the boundaries are created by us. If physics is correct and as David Bohm suggests \"everything overlaps and interpenetrates everything else,\" then where do we begin or end?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the boundaries we create through definitions may limit what can occur within those spaces, leading to chaos when those limits are challenged. However, it is important to recognize that these boundaries are constructs we create and that the true nature of matter and space is more interconnected than we often acknowledge. By being mindful of our definitions and the limitations they impose, we can work towards a more fluid understanding of our spaces and of ourselves."
