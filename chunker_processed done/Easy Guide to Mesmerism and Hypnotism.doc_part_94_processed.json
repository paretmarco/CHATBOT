  "title": "The Six Degrees of Mesmerism and Their Stages",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores different stages of mesmerism or hypnosis. The third and fourth degrees involve the subject being in a deep sleep-like state and being open to suggestion, respectively. The fifth degree includes clairvoyance, while the sixth degree involves the patient being beyond the control of the operator. These higher degrees suggest the existence of a spiritual aspect to human existence.",
  "content": "In this state the patient is able to obtain a clear knowledge of his own internal, mental, and bodily state, is able to calculate the nature of his, or her disease, prescribe suitable remedies, and foreshadow the termination of attack. The patient placed en rapport or in sympathy with a third person, is enabled in their case to exercise the same faculty of internal inspection, diagnosis and ability to prescribe and foreshadow the results of treatment 6th Degree.—THE INDEPENDENT OR SPIRITUAL STAGE.—In this the patient's vision is not limited by space or sympathy. He passes wholly as in the last stage partially, beyond the control of the operator. The phenomena occurring under the first four degrees are exceedingly common to all mesmerists. Those of the fifth degree, although not so common, are well authenticated under old mesmeric processes. They have not been produced under the now-popular' hypnotic method. The sixth degree, although rare, is well substantiated by the best authorities on the subject. The fifth and sixth degrees seem to indicate that man has a soul, or spiritual existence, or that he is a spirit even now, although clothed in a body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the stages of mesmerism may not be progressive or developed in any particular order, they do suggest the existence of a spiritual existence or soul within us. Moreover, exploring and reaching these higher stages of mesmerism can enable one to gain a clear understanding of their own internal state and make better-informed decisions about their health and well-being. It is an intriguing field of study worth exploring further."
