  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, two cases were presented that showed the potential benefits of Mesmerism in medical treatment. Now, the focus is on a specific case of a patient named Hannah Hunter, who had lost the ability to use her legs entirely. After being treated with tonics, cold shower-baths, and electricity, Hannah was mesmerized, and the peculiar sleep induced by this process was induced and removed at will. Over time, her strength returned, and she was able to stand and walk with only minimal support. The text raises questions about the potential of Mesmerism for further use in medical treatment.",
  "content": "It is now upwards of three months since she had the last fit.\" \"Hannah Hunter, aged thirteen, was admitted the beginning of last month, having lost the use of her legs entirely, and being unable even to sit up in a chair. The treatment adopted was tonics, cold shower-baths, and electricity. After these remedies had been persevered in for about three weeks, she so far improved as to be able to sit up; but was still unable to stand alone. On the two first occasions of being Mesmerised, drowsiness only was produced; the third time the peculiar sleep caused by this process was induced and removed at pleasure. After this had been continued for a few days, all the other means of treatment were omitted, the sleep was induced every day, and allowed to continue an hour or two. For a few days there was no apparent change; but after that she began to improve, her strength increased in proportion as the paralysis subsided, and she is now able to stand very well, and even to walk with very trifling assistance.\" FURTHER REPORT OF CASES TREATED MAGNETICALLV AT THE NORTH LONDON HOSPITAL.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of mesmerism as a form of treatment at North London Hospital has shown remarkable improvements in patients with paralysis. It has proven to be a compliment to traditional remedies such as tonics, cold shower-baths, and electricity. As seen from the case of Hannah Hunter, the specialized sleep induced was able to help her regain her strength and mobility."
