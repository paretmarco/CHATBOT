  "title": "\"The Athanor: An Ancient Western Tradition with Eastern Influences\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the ancient Western tradition represented by the athanor and its symbol of the human organism's regeneration. The last 200 tokens delve into the theories of Puysegur and his electro-magnetic fluid theory. He simplifies the process where man can display this fluid at pleasure and diffuse it externally by his movements to produce somnambulism. Moreover, he believed that the main point was \"croyez et veuillez\" meaning believe and will. The text also touches upon the physiological aspects of the body, specifically the vertex, and how magnetism and music can help achieve an expanded state of consciousness.",
  "content": "When we reproduce this state in our seminars people tell us it is incredibly restoring and peaceful. The theories of Puysegur As far as de Puysegur's theoretic views are concerned, there were some important modifications of those of Mesmer. \"It is concerning our sensations that Mesmer has come to enlighten us and his doctrine tends to lend support to all truths that until now, spoke only to the mind\" De Puysegur Less versed in physical science as his master, he always maintains the existence of an universal fluid, of which he recognizes the electric nature; but he simplifies the process: this fluid saturates all bodies, and especially the human body, which has a perfect electric organization, and is an animated electric machine. Man can display this electric fluid at pleasure, and diffuse it externally by his movements, in order to produce somnambulism. In any case de Puysegur was not very bothered with theory. He affirmed that the main point was “croyez et veuillez” which means “believe and will”.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, de Puysegur's modifications to Mesmer's theories led to the discovery of a tranquil state known as somnambulism through simple contact or spoken orders. This state has had therapeutic benefits and can be achieved by believing and willing it. De Puysegur's techniques have been proven to restore and bring peace to those who experience it."
