  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, practical methods to cure toothache and relieve headaches are discussed. The author advises placing the hand over the affected side of the face and then breathing into the ear through a flannel-covered ear on the same side. The breathing should be done strongly and steadily, with the pain being willed away. Any decent success in this technique can then be taken on to more serious matters such as relieving severe headaches by placing your hands on the forehead of the seated patient. The previous section of the text focuses on local treatments for rheumatic, neuralgic, cutting, bruising, and burning ailments. Mesmeric treatments are also discussed.",
  "content": "Then place a piece of flannel over the ear (on the same side of the head as the toothache); keep your hand still on the face, but now over the flannel, with the other hand over the head, holding the upper portion of the flannel (or fourfold ordinary pocket handkerchief) over the ear. Now breathe strongly and steadily into the ear through the covering thus made. Do this two or three times, strongly willing the removal of the pain. A warm, soothing influence will reach the offending tooth, and peace will ensue. At the last breath remove the handkerchief quickly, and the pain will be gone. A little success in this direction will enable you to try your hand at more serious business. Violent headaches—even arising from billious attacks—can be relieved in a remarkable way by passes. Stand behind the patient, who should be seated. Place your hands on the forehead.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these simple and effective techniques of breathing, passes and Mesmerism can bring about relief for toothaches, headaches, rheumatism and other painful conditions. With a little practice and faith in your abilities, you too can provide comfort and healing to those in need."
