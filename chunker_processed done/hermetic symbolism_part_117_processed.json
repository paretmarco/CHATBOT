  "title": "\"The Septenary Structure of the Human Self\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the various components of the human self and how they interact with one another. The author outlines the three fundamental principles present in every individual - Spirit, Soul, and Body - and how they correspond to the Seven Metals and Planets of ancient mythology. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves deeper into the various components of the self and how they create the core of an individual. The text also touches upon the importance of balance and harmony between these principles for good health and function. The god Mercury is aligned with the central nucleus of the self, which is the fluid space in which Spirit, Soul, and Body fuse together to create the Ethereal or astral Body.",
  "content": "In the centre there is a space in which Spirit, Soul and Body fuse together to create the Ethereal or astral Body, the Linga Sharira, in Theosophy. This is the core of the self, upon which everything else has an effect. This fluid central nucleus, which fulfils the role of intermediary, is aligned with the god Mercury of ancient mythology, and among the metals it is linked to Quick-silver. The other metals-planets are distributed as follows: Pure Spirit – Incorruptible Gold, Sun, Apollo, Atma; Ethereal Soul – Silver, Moon, Diana, Manas; Emotional spirit or spiritual soul – Tin, the lightest of the metals, Jupiter united with Juno, Buda; Corporeal spirit – Iron, Mars, Kama Rupa; Corporeal soul – Copper, Venus, Prana or Jiva; Body – Lead, Saturn, Rupa. The spiritual Sun represents the divine Light which makes our self lighter, but without weakening it; more specifically our emotional Spirit, upon which our Jupiterian awareness is focused. Indeed, the force that commands us comes from the Spirit and from the Soul, which shapes our emotions and forms ideals and images that help us to think and remember.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the fusion of Spirit, Soul and Body in the central nucleus creates the Ethereal Body, which forms the core of the self. Understanding the distribution of metals-planets and their associated colours helps us appreciate the intricacies of this spiritual concept. By realizing the importance of each element and their interconnections, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe."
