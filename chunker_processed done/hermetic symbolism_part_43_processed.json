  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the esoteric world of alchemy and the symbols it employs to describe its philosophical concepts. As we continue to explore this mysterious subject, we come across the idea of the Astral Light, which is said to hold supreme magical power. But the signs and symbols, such as Blue and Green Vitriol, have practical applications, too. The philosophical Gold is purified by an undifferentiated primordial substance that is thought of as the Base of infinite life. Lastly, we learn that the Philosophers’ Stone may not be as extraordinary as it is commonly believed to be.",
  "content": "On the other, there is the masculine fervour, described by the arrow of Mars , which furiously fires out the spiritual fluid in lavish bursts of flame. The Substance of Life / The Elixir of Life /The Life-Giving Substance It may have been more logical, before analysing the sign of the World , to discuss the simpler symbol of Antimony , but this graphic simplicity conceals the far more complicated nature of the idea symbolised here. The undifferentiated primordial substance is also thought of as the Base of infinite life . It is an ultra-subtle fluid, animated by unlimited dynamism, a never-ending heavenly Water that bathes, cleans and purifies the philosophical Gold, just as everyday antimony purifies earthly gold. In his Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, Basil Valentine says that, when prepared using spagyric methods, this substance is an antidote to all poisons. He calls it the Great Arcanum, the Stone of Fire, and ascribes so many virtues to it that no man is capable of describing all of them. The Philosophers’ Stone, on the other hand, has no particular outstanding qualities, either for curing the ailments of the human body or for metallic transmutation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the undifferentiated primordial substance, also known as the Substance of Life or Elixir of Life, symbolizes the base of infinite life. While the Philosophers' Stone is not known for its practical qualities, it represents anything that elevates us spiritually, freeing us from the material world. Meditating on the heavenly spirit, spiritualizing influence, spirit separate from matter, and evolution can help us understand the full scope of these symbols."
