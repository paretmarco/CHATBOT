  "title": "\"Di Pisa's Method for Quitting Smoking & Using Hand Movements for Improved Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article delves into two techniques for self-improvement: Di Pisa's method to stop smoking and using hands as visual cues to increase attention and expression of magnetism. The former involves fascination and encephalic congestion, breathing techniques, and increasing self-awareness to stop smoking. Meanwhile, the latter discusses how different hand movements express one's magnetic polarity, with male polarity showing an active personality and female polarity being receptive. Martial and Venusian show different types of personalities, while circular movements cater to those who use symbols and words. These techniques provide an interesting take on self-improvement, suggesting that self-awareness plays a critical role in one's success.",
  "content": "The different passages will make your client very self conscious of him and will lead him toward a new behaviour. HANDS AS VISUAL CUE TO INCREASE ATTENTION AND EXPRESSION OF MAGNETISM Many times hands are used. In this case it is very important the kind of movement that will be done. There are two types of magnetic polarity: male and female. Hermetists symbolized it through the following two signs: Male Polarity (martial)61 Female Polarity (venusian)62 Prof Benemeglio, an Italian researcher, observed how these polarities can express themselves also in everyday communication and not only in healing. We magnetise with our personality, as our personality depends from the type of our magnetic energy and Hands movements show it Martial hands movements are related to an active personality Venusian hands movements are related to a receptive personality Circular hands movements are related to a personality of thought, \"sublimating\" magnetism in symbols, words. Many times this is a later development of a mainly Martial side or a Venusian side.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating hands movements in your communication can enhance your personality and magnetism. Understanding the different polarities and types of hands movements can increase your attention and expression of magnetism. Use immediate touches or palmar imposition at a distance to practice magnetic passes for a stimulating effect."
