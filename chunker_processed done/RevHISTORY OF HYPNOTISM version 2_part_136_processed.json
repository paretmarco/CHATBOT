  "title": "Magnetism and Healing: The Power of Contact and Distance",
  "first_phrase": "This section explores the fascinating discoveries of Puysegur, who found that people in a magnetic sleep state could react at a distance. The text discusses Puysegur's experience of magnetizing a subject, who complained of pain when Puysegur removed his hand from a distance. The records of mesmerism demonstrate successful magnetic influence from a distance, suggesting a quantum entanglement between operator and subject. This concept aligns with the idea presented at the beginning of the book.",
  "content": "I quickly brought myself again into contact with him, expecting that he would now feel a more intense sensation, but it proved quite the contrary; the pressure of my hand had no effect whatsoever. Upon removing it to a distance of about one foot away from him, he again complained; at two feet distance, he felt a weight on his breast, and desired me to withdraw. I then drew myself back by degrees, and stopped only when he told me his pain was gone and he felt nothing. I was then five paces from him; I magnetized him at that distance by a slow and circular oscillation of my hand; and immediately his head reclined on his shoulder, and somnambulism supervened.\" In reality all the records pertaining to mesmerism, both early and recent, teem with illustrations of the way in which magnetic influence from a distance has been successfully exerted upon persons who were quite unprepared to expect it. This concept also teams up with the idea we have presented at the beginning of this book regarding a form of “quantum entanglement” between operator and subject taking effect.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the success of Puysegur's mesmerism demonstrates the potential of magnetic influence from a distance in inducing stable states for both humans and animals to facilitate healing. These findings offer a practical approach to alleviating pain and illnesses, providing a ray of hope for those in need of relief."
