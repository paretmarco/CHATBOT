  "title": "\"Magnetic Cures: Examples of Animal Magnetism in Medicine.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author described two cases of animal magnetism used as a cure. In the first case, a woman was cured of her habit of biting her hand while sleeping, thanks to the intervention of Dr. Loewe. In the second case, a woman who couldn't walk without crutches was able to walk after being magnetized by Dr. Loewe. These two examples demonstrate the therapeutic ability of animal magnetism not only in nervous disorders, but in other illnesses as well. In the following text, the author will discuss other examples of magnetic cures.",
  "content": "The doubts expressed by the patient and her friends did not in the least disconcert him, but, on the contrary, he sent his invitations to a great many people, that they might go and convince themselves, and acknowledge the truth of his assertion, and the triumph of magnetism. In the meantime the patient was magnetized every morning, and at each sitting a decided improvement was observed. On the eleventh day she began to attempt a few steps, being supported by the arms, and she left off using crutches. On the seventeenth, she came to the soiree of the magnetizer, ascended the stairs unassisted, walked about the room, and remained there until one o'clock in the morning, when she retired to her own house without having felt any more fatigue than would have been the case with a person in good health. Other examples of magnetic cures Magnetic cures can obviously be also done directly. And it is not only in nervous diseases that animal magnetism is so valuable a therapeutical agent; in derangements of the vascular system, in the early stages of inflammation, and on the accession of fevers, it is equally useful.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism has been shown to produce remarkable therapeutic benefits in various health disorders. Even though visible magnetic effects may not always be noticeable, its gradual healing transformative effects have been proven to lead to significant gradual improvement in the healthy state of individuals."
