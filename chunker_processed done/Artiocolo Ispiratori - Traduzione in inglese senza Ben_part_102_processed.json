  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Donato, the magnetizer, performs impressive experiments, causing a student to initially doubt the validity of the results. However, the student eventually becomes a fervent believer, attracting the attention of the audience. Donato's abilities span beyond France, also achieving success in Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Switzerland. In this final part, we delve into Dr. Servais' report of one experience where Donato fixates on a stranger's gaze and brings about a mysterious and unsettling effect.",
  "content": "Seeing Donato be followed by a young student, he drop to his knees Donato, with a laugh the first, approaching it too light and said with calm, full of gentle irony: - You took a lot of hysteria, Attention, it is a contagious disease (it says this joking, as Charcot said that only histeric people were hypnotizable) Finally, in order to make you understand the phenomenon better, I quote here under verbatim a report drawn up by Dr. Servais concerning one of Donato’s experiences, which took place in the year 1876 in Paris, the experimenter’s last place of residence after he had previously visited Belgium, Holland, Germany and Switerland, met with success all over, and never failed in any of his experiments: “Donato fixes his strange and disquieting look on the eyes of a man he had never seen before.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Donato's ability to hypnotize his subjects is a fascinating phenomenon that has been witnessed by many people over the years. Although it may seem disquieting and mysterious, hypnosis can be a powerful tool in understanding the human mind and behavior. Understanding this art and science can help us tap into our potential and improve ourselves in many ways."
