  "title": "\"The Sensational Hypnotic Experiments of Donato and Brémaud\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, we delve deeper into the aftermath of Donato's sessions and how they caused a stir among the medical community. Doctor Brémaud sought to clear Donato's name by tracing and hypnotizing hundreds of subjects, including those who had already seen Donato. He improved the process by introducing a brutal action that increased hypnotic sensibility. This section will reveal the effects of Dr. Brémaud's hypnotic process, including the rare cases where resistance was offered.",
  "content": "He introduced changes to the method of the master, improving it in the process with the aim of securing an even faster hypnosis. He accomplished that by having it prefaced by a brutal action having the effect of producing a strong encephalic congestion. He would cause the subject to relax in front of him, his loose arms dangling by the sides, and then, by catching him suddenly from the back, he would make him turn around himself as quickly as possible to thereby heighten hypnotic sensibility. Thereafter, he would go on with the fascination process ... In those extremely rare cases where the subject offered resistance, he would make him bend, for three to five minutes, with his head close to the ground. Once the highest level of congestion had been reached, he would begin the fascination process by disclosing his face before some source of light.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the process described by the author may seem extreme, the concept of the \"state of block\" offers a valuable insight into the potential of hypnosis. By exploring different approaches and techniques, practitioners may be able to achieve even more mesmerizing results and unlock the full potential of the mind."
