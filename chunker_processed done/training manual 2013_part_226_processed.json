  "title": "\"The Mandelbaum Effect: Understanding Perception and Binocular Function\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the Mandelbaum Effect and how it influences our perception of distance. This phenomenon is not a structural characteristic of the eyes but instead arises from normal variations of perception in the brain. It is well-known in aviation where dirty glass can worsen the effect and cause a pilot to miss an obstacle or hazard. In this last part, we'll discover how this effect can be used in hypnosis and how it affects the voice's perceived location as the operator moves away.",
  "content": "Use in hypnosis: after having secured fixation of gaze do sweeping movements in front of your subject SPEAKING FROM OUTSIDE THE SUBJECT'S MICROCOSM Movement and increasing of the Mandelbaum Effect The eye is lazy and resists the pull of a distant stimulus , preferring to rest at a relatively short focal distance as it does in the dark or when looking at the sky. As the operator will move farther he will move outside this point and his voice will seem to arrive from a different location.",
  "last_phrase": "Mastering the art of hypnosis can have a profound effect on people. Using techniques such as fixation of gaze, sweeping movements, and altering binocular functions can lead to a Mandelbaum Effect, where the operator's voice seems to come from outside the subject's microcosm. By following the steps of the fascination technique, including pushing energy and projecting a mental image, one can absorb the spirit of the person in front of them and go beyond three-dimensional reality. With practice, these techniques can be highly effective in inducing a trance-like state in the subject."
