  "title": "\"The Symbolism of the Set Square and Swastika\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the importance of the Set Square in Masonry as it determines the precise configuration for stones to fit together seamlessly. The Master of the Masons is responsible for maintaining harmony among his collaborators by reconciling opposing elements and upholding discipline. This leads to the creation of a perfect edifice. In the last 200 tokens of the text, the symbolism of the Set Square sheds light on the mystery of the Swastika. It represents the Sacred Fire, which creates and breathes life into all things and is identified with the Great Architect of the Universe by Freemasons. The elements, which correspond to the right angles of the Swastika, are direct emanations of the generative Cause.",
  "content": "We refer to the hooked Cross , called Swastika in India and Fyrfos in ancient Scandinavia. It is made up of two set squares that appear to emanate from a common centre to form a wheel, the wheel of Creation or of Fortune, in fact, we are in the presence of an emblem that represents the Sacred Fire, creator of all things. Our prehistoric ancestors identified this fire, that breathes life into matter and creates it at the same time, with their supreme Divinity, which the Freemasons bestowed the name of the Great Architect of the Universe. The origin of all intelligence and all fertile activity, it governs the Chaos of the Beginning, guiding the quaternary of the Elements from potential through to action. The elements, which are direct emanations of the generative Cause, correspond to the right angles of the Swastika, whose vertical arm gives rise to both Air and Earth , while Fire and Water can both be construed from the horizontal arm . These last two occult Elements both act, one in an ascendant, expansive direction , and the other conversely, by shedding and constricting .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Swastika, Fyrfos, and hooked cross are all representations of the Sacred Fire and the four Elements. These symbols hold great significance as they reflect the origins of our existence and the creation of matter. By understanding the connections between these symbols, we can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and the forces that govern it."
