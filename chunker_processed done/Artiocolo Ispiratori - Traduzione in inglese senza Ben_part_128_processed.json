  "title": "\"The Healing Art of Prof. Di Pisa: Beyond Sensing Reality\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the art of \"bi-location\" and its expert practitioner Prof. Caravelli. Now, we delve into the practices of Prof. Di Pisa, who practiced similar techniques for healing purposes. Prof. Di Pisa had a remarkable ability to give mediumistic diagnoses, often requiring just a few seconds of interaction. He employed reflected light as an important tool, going beyond traditional senses to perceive reality. Prof. Di Pisa was a gifted and positive personality, always ready with a witty remark.",
  "content": "We should mention, at this stage, some distinguishing features of his personality. He paid the closest attention to details and was extremely alert in every situation. He was truly present, capable as such of perceiving whatever was taking place. Because of that quality, he was gifted with a deep ability to give mediumistic diagnoses. Within the space of a few seconds only, he could inform a person about any sickness he had. All he needed from his subject was a few secondsâ€™ smile, which he often elicited from him by cracking a joke. In many instances, he only needed the time at which one waits at a robot. I remember that, once, when we had stopped at a robot, he started telling an elderly woman whatever disease was plaguing her, and where exactly it did so in her body, and the woman immediately confirmed the full accuracy of his information. He had a positive and optimistic character, and was always ready to share a witty remark.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the personality of this gifted medium was marked by a keen attention to detail, alertness, presence, and the ability to provide immediate diagnoses. With a positive and optimistic character, he used his charming smile and wit to captivate and mesmerize his clients. His strong vibrations and unwavering certainty added to his charismatic persona, making him a memorable figure in the realm of mediumship."
