  "title": "\"The Path to Presence: Magnetic Healing and Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the text, we delve deeper into the concept of presence and its importance in human evolution. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, having explored traditions like Bon from Tibet and Egyptian, emphasizes the need to attain higher states of presence. The final stage is more quantum, where consciousness is at the center, rather than physical. The authors draw parallels between this and modern quantum technology and eastern teachings. They advise starting by being conscious of the body, the first step towards developing an increased presence. By following practical seminars, one can learn this methodological set of indispensable techniques and heal oneself and others in a natural way.",
  "content": "This type of “presence in the action” has in fact a methodological set of indispensable techniques which are peculiar to it. It is undoubted that presence is reached and inward changes occur in the course of a practitioner’s progress along this path. The final state is more definible in quantum terms, with consciousness at the centre, than in physical habitual terms. Presence in the action accordingly shows itself to be the central key to man’s evolution. It can only be learnt as part of a practical seminar, preferably one held in a natural environment. The mere act of setting out on this path allows one both to feel better in himself and to heal others and perceive energies in a natural way. The following are the first advices for taking the initial steps on the way to develop an increased presence: 1 – Start from the “consciousness of the body”. That is in fact the very first part the average man’s perception becoming “anesthetized”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a heightened sense of presence in the action is essential to achieving inner change and evolution. To begin, focus on the consciousness of your body and maintain this awareness as long as possible. This practice can lead to a better understanding of energies and a more natural way of perceiving the world around us. Consider attending a practical seminar in a natural environment for further development on this path."
