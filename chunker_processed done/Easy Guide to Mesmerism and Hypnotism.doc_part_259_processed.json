  "title": "\"The Secret of Mesmerism: Uncovering the Power of Gaze and Will\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author and their colleagues searched for the secret of hypnotic fascination and mesmerism, meeting and learning from many experts in the field, but to no avail. In the last 200 tokens, they finally found the secret by studying the old texts of hypnotism from the 1800s and understanding the concept of fluidism and the role of inner thought. They obtained a big chunk of the secret and decided to share it with the world as they believe it is a treasure of humanity. They also emphasize that hypnotic fascination and mesmerism are not single techniques but a \"system\".",
  "content": "Modern hypnosis gives many reasons, but it is normally bound to the use of words, and has put all possibility of supernatural out of the door. To make mesmerism work you must: 1 - Accept completely 1) the classic idea of fluidism and supernatural, or otherwise, 2) accept the point of view of Quantum Theory that says that you can determine reality and “the measurement creates reality” 2 - Not rely on words, but on inner thought. Mesmerism is based on the consideration that we are “creator of our own reality.” We went back again to the elderly man who had the secret and we got it, or at least we got a big chunk. Now we have decided to share it as we truly believe it is a treasure of humanity. The “SYSTEM” Hypnotic fascination and mesmerism are a “system” and not a single technique.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism is a system that involves various techniques such as the power of mental concentration, breathing, and will, and is not limited to the use of words. To make mesmerism work, one must either accept the classic idea of fluidism and supernaturalism or embrace the view of Quantum Theory. It is important to cultivate willpower and understand the power of nature to harness life force energy effectively. With these tools, practitioners can unlock the treasure trove of hypnotic fascination and mesmerism."
