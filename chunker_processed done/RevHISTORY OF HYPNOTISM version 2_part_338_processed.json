  "title": "\"What was Lafontaine's unforgettable seance experience, where multiple audience members went into a trance and showed uncontrollable phenomena of attraction?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, Lafontaine, a French magnetizer, shared his preference for developing excellent clairvoyants rather than taking subjects with him as the latter raised the suspicion of trickery. He also shared curious experiences, which he explained with the fluid theory. In particular, he spoke of a seance where he had to awaken his somnambules after they exhibited unanticipated attraction. In a separate incident in his \"Memoires d'un Magnetiseur,\" he shared how one of his subjects magnetized another woman who put her to sleep, leading to a strange phenomenon where Clarisse fell into a magnetic sleep as if she transferred all fluid to the subject.",
  "content": "It was now the turn of the other to awaken Clarisse, which she succeeded in doing, but the moment Clarisse awoke she herself again fell asleep; Clarisse awoke the girl a second time, but immediately fell asleep again herself, and this time, to the alarm of the spectators, her sleep was accompanied by convulsive movements, which soon became a violent nervous attack. They sent for me in haste, and when I arrived the other girl, who was much frightened, was becoming similarly attacked. \" An interesting seance Lafontaine in his \"Memoires\" gives an account of a seance the like of which never occurred again in his experience, and which puzzled him not a little. He announced to the audience that his clairvoyante had disappointed him, and they expressed themselves satisfied if he operated only upon his other subjects for physical effects. He thereupon put his three somnambules to sleep, but had to awaken two of them, as they exhibited unlooked-for phenomena of attraction. For when he paralysed their legs to prevent them from coming to him, they slid off their chairs and rolled over to his feet.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Lafontaine’s account of the perplexing and fascinating séance highlights the unpredictable and powerful nature of the unconscious mind. This serves as a reminder that even with modern scientific understanding, there is still much to be learned about the mysteries of the human psyche."
