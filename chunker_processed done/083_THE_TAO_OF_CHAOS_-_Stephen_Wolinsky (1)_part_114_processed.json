  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Understanding the Solidification of Energy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author delves into the concept of solidified energy and the formation of self-identities and structures. They explain how energy and associations develop meanings, creating self-similar universes that give rise to chaos, which is actually an ordered chain of earlier similar associations. The accumulation of solidified energy forms patterns that are used to explain the world and its movements. The author also discusses the idea that defining energy gives it boundaries and separates it from other energy, leading to the formation of the self.",
  "content": "This appears subjectively to someone observing their mind as chaos. Actually, as will be discussed later, this chaos is ordered in a \"chain of earlier similar associations.\" Chaos and Energy It is the definition placed on energy which gives it boundaries.' Energy when undefined does what it does, but when we define ourselves as separate from other energy giving it a meaning, a significance, we place boundaries around ourself I See Quantum Consciousness, Chapters 4 and 5 ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 81 and others. What then is this self? As will be discussed later, it is the accumulation or chain of associations of events in a self-similar organization of universes held within consciousness. This is parallel universes that arise and subside in emptiness with its own order and which subjectively appears as chaos. In short, it can be said that what you call your psyche is an accumulation of energy which is solidified. This solidified energy organizes itself into networks of similar associations and experiences. This accumulation of solidified energy forms I-dentities and structures. These I-dentities and structures form patterns. These patterns are then used to explain the world and its movement.",
  "last_phrase": "To learn the Tao of Chaos, we must shift our subjective experience into its true nature - energy - by de-labeling and understanding that the feeling of chaos is the accumulation of solidified energy forming patterns and structures, leading us to see the present in the past. By removing arbitrary boundaries, we can alleviate the feelings of chaos and confusion, and understand the order within it."
