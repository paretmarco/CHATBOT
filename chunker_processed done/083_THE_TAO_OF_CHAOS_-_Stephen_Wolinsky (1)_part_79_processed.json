  "title": "\"The Illusion of Time and Emptiness in Parallel Worlds\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the illusion of time was discussed and how we define ourselves in an ever-changing view. In the last 200 tokens, the concept of parallel worlds and emptiness is explored. Each parallel world is made up of condensed emptiness, which pulsates and thins out. In Taoist philosophy, this pulsation is called ch'i, which condenses to form all things and returns to the great void. The Tao of Chaos exercise #5 is then introduced, which allows one to observe the pulsation of emptiness and how it becomes a thought, feeling, or sensation, and then thins out.",
  "content": "When it disperses, its visibility is no longer apparent and there are no shapes.\" (Quoted in Fung Yu-lan, a Short History of Chinese Philosophy, p. 279) ________________ \"The great void cannot but consist of ch'i; this ch'i cannot but condense to form all things; and these things cannot but become dispersed so as to form once more the Great Void.\" (Quoted in Fung Yu-lan, a Short History of Chinese Philosophy, p. 280) Tao of Chaos Exercise #5 Step I Allow your eyes to close and notice the emptiness. Step II Now when a thought goes by see it as condensed emptiness or made of the same substance as the emptiness. Step III Notice that the emptiness pulsates condensing down becoming a thought feeling sensation, or association, and then thins out becoming emptiness. This means that who you think you are appears and disappears yet we don't notice it. Why? Because the emptiness disappears. This means as emptiness condenses into a thought called \"I like myself,\" at some point the condensed emptiness will thin out and become emptiness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through the Tao of Chaos exercise, we can observe how the emptiness pulsates, condenses, and disperses, forming all things around us, including our thoughts and feelings. By understanding this constant process, we can let go of our attachment to our ego and embrace the ever-changing nature of existence."
