  "title": "\"The Talents of Power Rolando and Virgilio: Anecdotes of Hypnotism and Painting\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the reader was introduced to the life of Power Rolando and Virgilio, both gifted painters with extraordinary abilities. The final part of the text delves deeper into the unique talents of Virgilio, who learned his art from Rolando. Virgilio had the power to hypnotize animals and was often called upon to calm down inmates at a nearby mental asylum. He spent a few years in Paris, learning more techniques from contemporary hypnotists and developing his interest in telepathy. This part also sheds light on the curious facts related to this phase of his life, where farmers summoned him to make animals more tameable.",
  "content": "His main interest, however, was represented by painting. Indeed, fascination always occupied in his life the position of an optional engagement, a spare pursuit which he nevertheless practiced with remarkable success. Virgilio learnt from Rolando when he was 14. Thenceforth, once he had put into practice the required canonical exercises, he first began to apply the power of his look to animals. In the process, he succeeded in hypnotizing reptiles, chickens, cows, mules, and so on. There are many curious facts related to such phase of his life. An example of them is that farmers were accustomed to summon him to their places in order to make some animals more tameable. He later spent a couple of years in Paris, where he learnt an additional range of techniques from contemporary hypnotists. Virgilio has particularly developed the field of telepathy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Virgilio's main interest was painting, his skill as a hypnotist and telepathic artist was truly remarkable. He was known to hypnotize various animals and help farmers make them more manageable. With his skills in telepathy and hypnosis, he further developed his techniques, which were often used without any voiced suggestions. Virgilio's life is a testament to the power of observation, practice, and creativity in unlocking hidden talents."
