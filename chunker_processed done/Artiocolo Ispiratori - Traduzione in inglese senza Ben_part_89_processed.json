  "title": "The Impact of Donato on the Revival of Animal Magnetism in Europe",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explained how mesmerism was on the brink of obscurity until some masters of the art, such as Du Potet and Lafontaine, brought it back to prominence by traveling from town to town to perform exhibitions. The author then described how these masters influenced the likes of Doctor Charcot, Doctor Bernheim, Doctor Braid, Doctor Liebeault, and Doctor Heidenhain to contribute remarkable works in the field. The main challenge was the difficulty of disseminating information about the real technique, which was primarily kept a secret. In this final part, the author introduces Donato (Alfred d'Hont), a Belgian-born poet and writer, who revolutionized hypnotic practice through his rediscovery of \"fascination.\" Despite not being a healer, Donato sparked Europe's interest in Animal Magnetism like no other and became an apostle of the art.",
  "content": "The main methods in use were slow, laborious and lacking efficacy, thereby easily discouraging the efforts of magnetizers and facilitating the disbelief of their adversaries. In 1873, however, we find Donato (the Belgian-born Alfred d'Hont) initiated to mesmerism by the Canon Mouls de Bordeaux. Even if he was not primarily a healer, Donato reversed in many people’s minds the old conceptions which had existed until that moment, and during his short and impetuous life, he revived in the whole of Europe the interest in Animal Magnetism more than any other person before him had done. Donato was not a vulgar man. First a soldier, then a civil servant, journalist, novelist and poet, and finally a student and apostle of animal magnetism, Donato revolutionized hypnotic practice through his rediscovery of “fascination”. Even if the eye had been used in the past, the real technique was not so diffused and practiced. Donato was blessed with uncommon physical strength, quick and insistent eyes, a great agility of movement, and much spirit.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Donato's contributions to animal magnetism cannot be overstated. His rediscovery of \"fascination\" revolutionized hypnotic practice and reignited interest in the field throughout Europe. Donato's physical strength, quick eyes, agility, and spirit enabled him to achieve astonishing results, unlike his predecessors who used slow and laborious methods. His techniques not only proved the reality of somnambulism but also led to the discovery of other remarkable phenomena. Overall, Donato's impact on animal magnetism was exceptional, leaving behind a legacy that deserves recognition."
