  "title": "\"Magnetism by Long Pass: A Method for Pain Relief and Well-being\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the following text, the author discusses methods for practicing magnetism and how to cure localized pain using this method. In the last 200 tokens, the author provides guidance on how to relieve specific pains through magnetic passes. The text refers to Deleuze, a somnambulist who was able to induce sleep through magnetic therapy without touching the patient. The author also advises readers to begin the practice with the long pass, which yields incredible peace and well-being. The text concludes by offering principles to guide practitioners in curing localized pain, such as focusing the magnetic pass on the afflicted area.",
  "content": "Deleuze sometimes produced somnambulism by this process, without establishing the communication by touching. Further proceedings This is what I have to say about magnetism by the long pass, with which it is always proper to commence, and to which a person may confine himself until he has a reason for employing other processes. Let us now consider the circumstances which point out particular processes. When any one has a local pain, it is natural, after establishing a communication, to carry the magnetic action to the suffering part. It is not by passing the hands over the arms that we undertake to cure a sciatic ; it is not by putting the hand upon the stomach that we can dissipate a pain in the knee. Here are some principles to guide us. The magnetic pass, if well done, draws along with it the pain. For example, do you desire to cure a pain in the shoulder? Hold your hand upon the shoulder for some time, then descend, and after having quitted the ends of the fingers, recommence patiently the same process. Would you cure a pain in the stomach, place your hands several minutes upon the stomach and descend to the knees.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, when practicing magnetic passes for pain relief, it is crucial to first establish communication and draw the pain through the passes. Specific processes should be applied to the affected area, and it may take time to completely dissipate the pain. Remember, the intention behind the process is just as important as the method itself."
