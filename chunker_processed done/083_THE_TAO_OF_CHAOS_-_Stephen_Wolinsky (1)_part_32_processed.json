  "first_phrase": "This text explores the groundbreaking work of Dr. Erickson in hypnosis and psychotherapy. In the first part, we learn about his personal struggle with physical pain and how he became a master of pain control using self-hypnosis. In the last 200 tokens, we delve into his philosophy that a client's personal history holds unused resources that could be applied in present situations. By accessing these resources, hypnosis can help individuals handle chaos and reframing their lives. Though most people avoid or run away from craziness, Dr. Erickson believed that it holds potential and can be a resource if harnessed.",
