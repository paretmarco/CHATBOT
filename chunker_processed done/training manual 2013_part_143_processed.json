  "title": "\"Concentration and Posture: Techniques for Successful Mindfulness Practice\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author explains how to achieve the right physical and mental state for concentration. The recommended posture involves an upright spine, relaxed muscles, and facing away from distracting light. The author then suggests focusing on a non-stimulating object such as a penny placed at eye level, which, when looked at steadily, helps eliminate wandering thoughts. Deep, gentle breathing is also recommended to further promote a tranquil state of mind. All these elements are vital to achieving success in the pursuit of knowledge.",
  "content": "If the chair proves too low, place a book on the seat of the chair and sit upon it. As soon as correct position is determined, everything is in readiness to proceed. Empty the lungs, first by exhaling all the air you possibly can with perfect ease, but use no effort or strain. Everything in this work is to be done easily, gracefully and with perfect tranquillity. Now inhale through the nostrils only, slowly, gently, fully, and with perfect rhythm for seven seconds. Begin by filling the upper lobes of the lungs as much as the position taken will allow naturally and without effort, then the remainder of the respiratory organs even to the utmost. In the exhalation observe the same rule, controlling the action of the lungs so as to prevent spasms, unevenness, or rapidity --- all must be done in perfect waves and circles.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember that maintaining a correct position and breathing rhythm are key to obtaining the greatest benefits from breathing exercises. Keep everything calm, easy, and graceful; simply focus on the breathing process and let it guide you towards a deeper sense of tranquility and mindfulness. By being fully present in your breath, you can harness the full power of the Breath of Life and find peace within yourself."
