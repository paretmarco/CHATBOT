  "title": "\"The Importance of Presence: Insights from Giuliano Kremmerz and Count J.P. de Giudicelli\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"Presence\" as a means of achieving well-being and perceiving energies. It references Giuliano Kremmerz, who spread his Hermetic Brotherhood, and Franz Mesmer, who had connections to the Egyptian Rite. The author met Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, a representative of the brotherhood, and discusses their exploration of French traditions. The last 200 tokens highlight Count de Giudicelli's research and his connection to the inner circle of the brotherhood.",
  "content": "One part of us must be in the now if we want to fascinate, magnetize and so forth. We must disengage ourselves from the world of our thoughts. F.A. Mesmer, too, provides us with the account of a similar practice, albeit one he possibly reached purely through intuition. He does so when, as part of the story of his life, he recounts to us the time when he stayed three months without any internal dialogue, able thereby to perceive reality directly. While in France, I came to know Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, a legitimate representative of such brotherhood in that country, and likewise a member of its innermost circle. The meeting with him occurred by chance, as he took part in one of the courses I was running in that country on hypnotic techniques. We have been in touch with one another since then. Count J. P. de Giudicelli was and still is an unconditional researcher, one who has explored the entire gamut of French traditions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to achieving the best results is by being present in the moment and disengaging ourselves from the world of our thoughts. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, an unconditional researcher, emphasizes the importance of presence and has explored French traditions extensively. He reminds us that sometimes, we tend to overlook the simple things in our search for complexity, but with a pragmatic point of view, we can find the way forward."
