  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the connection between sexual strength and the enhancement of man through the use of the magnet as described by Kremmerz and Pernety. This strength is also linked to igneous quicksilver and breathing, which can be utilized through exercises such as the one described. In this last part, we delve into the power of presence therapy. This type of therapy operates on a vertical level where change is not the main focus, rather the goal is to become more present and fully oneself. The concept of being present goes beyond the layers of the mind, including the cerebellum, limbic brain, and neocortex. Your true self is much more than any of these individual components.",
  "content": "Exercise120 Lean back holding your head looking in front of you (this posture is also used in bioenergy) Begin breathing taking the energy in front of you and back of you. You don’t need to imagine if you will be present. You will feel it. Continue until you can. After rebalance back your body leaning forward. MORE EXERCISES OF PRESENCE THERAPY Presence therapy is a vertical therapy and it is the most powerful therapy. It is a kind of therapy where you don’t do first level “change”. You do more. You change your reality as you become more present. You become more yourself. But where are you when you are “present”? If we resort to the classical model of the mind where we have three layers: the cerebellum, the limbic brain connected to your emotion and the neocortex you are in neither of them. You are beyond. In the same way you are not your right brain no more than you are your left brain. Your true self is much more.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating presence therapy exercises into your daily routine can help you change your reality by becoming more present and true to yourself. The exercise of the sphere of light is an effective tool for working on fears and negative feelings by focusing your awareness on the present moment. Give it a try and experience the natural healing that follows."
