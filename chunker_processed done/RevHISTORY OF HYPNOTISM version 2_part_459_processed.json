  "title": "Can Humans Possess a Modification of the Same Power as Electric Fish? - Mesmerism and its Physical Power",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses mesmerism and the physical power it exerts. The author rejects imagination and fascination as explanations for the observed effects, instead believing in a physical contact-based mechanism. He hypothesizes that humans possess a power similar to that of electric fish. In the last 200 tokens, he describes the circumstances of his patients' mesmeric therapy, emphasizing the importance of the patient's ignorance of the procedure. The author emphasizes the physicality of the process throughout the text, providing a unique perspective on mesmerism.",
  "content": "At all events he discards both imagination and fascination as inadequate to explain the effects produced by his method:- \"From the circumstances attending my first case, all my subsequent proceedings were determined by the conviction that the mesmeric influence, as it came under my observation, was a physical power, exerted by one animal over another, in certain circumstances and conditions of their respective systems; and I should as soon adopt the diabolical theory as a satisfactory solution of the problem, as attempt to account by the action of the imagination for what I have seen and done. It has been related that all my patients were mesmerised with their eyes closed, lying in bed, in a dark room, and that it was considered desirable that the patient should be totally ignorant of what was intended to be done; and I even stipulated with the mesmeric committee that the patients brought before them should be kept in as profound ignorance of our intentions as possible.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile’s success with mesmeric healing seems to have relied on the physical power of animal magnetism rather than imagination or fascination. His strict experimental procedures and conviction that mesmerism was a valuable healing agent lend credibility to his findings. While he may not have been as curious as some, Esdaile’s emphasis on the practical application of mesmerism remains a valuable contribution to the field."
