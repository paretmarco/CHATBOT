  "title": "\"The Story of Vincenzo Campanelli: The Magician Who Cured Smoking\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we will delve into the stunning success of Vincenzo Campanelli's revolutionary method to help people quit smoking. Campanelli's technique was so effective that he had an impressive success rate of nearly 70% with patients treated in less than 50 seconds. His impressive clientele included King Hussein of Jordan and Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres. Campanelli's success rate was even higher when multiple sessions were used. His clients, many of whom were doctors themselves, attest to his impressive abilities.",
  "content": "Within the 25 years of his second activity, which he viewed as a humanitarian mission, he freed from the bondage of the cigarette not less than fifteen thousand erstwhile smokers. The positive score of his remedial intervention is set at approximately 70% of the subjects he treated, and that if we only consider the instances of treating them over a session lasting less than a minute. The success rate was even higher when more than one session was resorted to (Campanelli, in fact, would only ask for the first session to be paid). From a statistical point of view, the percentage of successful treatments was remarkably high, if account is additionally paid to the fact that several of the people who approached him for help had already tried other methods of quitting in vain. Besides, the people who vouch for the validity of his curative intervention belong almost entirely to social categories which can hardly be persuasively said to be the targets of mere suggestion or deception. Many of his clients, indeed, had themselves practiced as doctors once.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Campanelli's curative intervention achieved remarkable success, freeing over 15,000 erstwhile smokers from the bondage of cigarettes. His impressive success rate was consistently high, even amongst people who had tried other methods of quitting in vain. His patients included famous movie directors, politicians, high-level prosecutors, top military cadres, doctors, and many more. Campanelliâ€™s incredible ability and success rate aided significantly in improving the lives and health of countless individuals."
