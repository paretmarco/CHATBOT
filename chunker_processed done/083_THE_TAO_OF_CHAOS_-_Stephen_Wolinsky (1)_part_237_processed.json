  "title": "\"Exploring Emptiness and Finding Love in Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of \"musturbation,\" coined by Albert Ellis, was introduced as a way of describing the constant belief that things \"must not\" be a certain way. Continuing on this topic, the section explores how individuals seek relationships to fill up their inner emptiness. A therapist helps a client confront their feeling of emptiness and leads them through a process of peeling back layers of fear and loneliness to ultimately find a sense of peacefulness and calm. The section concludes by asking the client to connect with the feeling of love that resides within the empty void.",
  "content": "(points to solar plexus) Therapist: Turn your attention around and walk into the emptiness. Client: I'm scared. Therapist: Notice the fear; is there an outer layer the fear is attached to? Client: There is a part of me that has an overwhelming desire for love. Therapist: Peel back the fear and tell me what is underneath it. Client: Loneliness. Therapist: Peel back the loneliness and tell me what is there. Client: An empty space. Therapist: Go into the empty space and tell me what you experience. Client: Terror Therapist: Peel back the terror, what's there? Client: A big empty void. Therapist: Go into the void and tell me what that's like. Client: Peaceful, spacious... calm. Therapist: From \"back there\" inside the empty void, how do those I-dentities in the foreground seem to you? Client: Like they are floating in empty space. Therapist: Ask all of them, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: Love. Therapist: Feel the love \"back there\"?",
