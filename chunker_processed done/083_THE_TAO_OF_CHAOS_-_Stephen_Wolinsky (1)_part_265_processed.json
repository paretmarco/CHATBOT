  "title": "\"Reabsorbing Identities as Energy in Therapy Session\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text \"The Tao of Chaos,\" the therapist guides the client through a process of reabsorbing their identities and emotions into \"back there,\" a place of power, safety, and love. The therapist notes that this process is explored more in-depth in \"Quantum Consciousness, Volume. I, Chapter 4, The Energy of Emotions.\" The text concludes by discussing how the therapist asked the client to place a mother mask over his wife's face in his mind, in order to make the implicit explicit and add awareness to the process.",
  "content": "Therapist: Now reabsorb the energy into the essence of \"back there,\" as you feel the power, safety and love of \"back there.\" Client: Okay. Therapist: How are you doing now? Client: Great. Therapeutic Note Here we are adding a third variation to this process; seeing the I-dentities and emotions as energy and reabsorbing them back into Essence. This is explored in depth in Quantum Consciousness, Volume. I, Chapter 4, The Energy of Emotions. Conclusion Here again, the reabsorption process is quite easy. To integrate the process and look at the trance-ference more clearly, I asked the client for a week to internally, in his mind, place a mother mask over the face of his wife. In this way I am asking him to do knowingly, consciously, and intentionally that which he is doing unkowningly, unconsciously, and unintentionally. This hopefully aids in making the implicit explicit, 214 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS thus adding the quality of awareness to the process. Awareness is the solvent that loosens the glue of 1-dentities which are stuck to us!!! ________________ Z VD O 4t Z e IT II. I'M O.K.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, integrating the reabsorption process by seeing emotions and identities as energy can be a powerful tool in therapy. Adding awareness to the process can aid in making the implicit explicit and loosen the glue of the identities that are stuck to us. This allows for a greater sense of freedom and acceptance in our relationships with ourselves and others."
