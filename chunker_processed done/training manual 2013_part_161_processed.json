  "title": "\"Circular Arm Exercise for Discipleship Training\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author emphasized the temporary nature of the exercises and the transition from disciple to master. They also pointed out how the study of harmony requires following rules before being able to create personal rules. In this last section, the author introduces Exercise Four, which is performed four times a day facing different directions. The exercise involves standing, inhaling gradually, and swinging the right arm in a circular motion in front of the body. The author suggests using personal judgement on inhalation and exhalation, starting with inhaling for three circles and exhaling for three.",
  "content": "EXERCISE FOUR This exercise is to be taken four times each day. In the morning you are to face the East, at noon turn toward the South, in the evening face the West, and before retiring for the night's slumber, turn the face toward the North. And now to the work itself. Take a standing position as in second exercise. After you have taken the prelude breath and thoroughly emptied the lungs, inhale gradually and gently; at the same time swing the right arm, which is to be in a perfectly relaxed condition, with a circular motion in front of you, palm of hand turned toward the body. Make a perfect circular movement. Use your own judgment as to inhalation and exhalation. To begin with it will be the easiest to inhale while making three circles, and exhale while making the same number of movements.",
  "last_phrase": "The key to mastering this exercise is perseverance and patience. With consistent daily practice, you'll slowly build up your stamina and technique until you can perform it flawlessly. Remember to focus on proper breathing and fluid movements, and don't be discouraged by any initial difficulty you may encounter. Keep at it, and you'll soon reap the benefits of increased strength, flexibility, and mindfulness."
