  "content": "He triumphed over such intrigue in an indirect manner, Having temporarily retired, he returned to Lake Constance after the days he had spent therein in his childhood. He returned to Nature and strove to get as far as he could to the bottom of natural knowledge. Guided by his belief that language and reasoning prevented man from gaining instinctive access to the foundation of his natural power, he went through an intense exercise, steering clear of inner dialogue for a period of three consecutive months. Following this period, he came back strengthened, with his senses heightened and an even greater magnetic power. Editorâ€™s note: we can again see how magnetism is something completely natural. Developing animal magnetism means reconnecting with Nature. Practical hint: If you want to really heal people reconnect yourself with the inborn force of Nature. Ground yourself. Breathe deeply and get into contact with the marvel of the Universe each day. If you live in town, look up at the sky, ground yourself, and you will find you will feel more power inside yourself.",
