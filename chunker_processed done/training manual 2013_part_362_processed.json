  "title": "\"The Levels of Receptiveness: Exercises for Spiritual and Biological Vitality\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraph, the author discusses the importance of receptiveness and its relation to various levels of biological and spiritual vitality. Now, the text delves deeper and outlines exercises and practices to achieve these levels. The first level involves integrating perceptive consciousness by silencing conceptualizations and focusing on primary and external sensations. Vigilant attention to senses is required to go beyond automatic mechanisms and perceive reality. The text also mentions traditional keys like the four basic elements corresponding to the senses.",
  "content": "One then adds to it attention to our “external sensations”, such as the awareness of the images that strike our eye, of the sounds that reach our ear, and of the inward sensations where the weight of the body, concentration on the breath, attention to bodily heat, and the feeling pervading the bones, all represent essential elements. We must go beyond the “microtrances” which consist in the automatic mechanisms robbing us of the perception of reality. An effective effort of vigilant attention to oneself and to one’s own senses, which ought to be resolved upon wisely and pursued consistently, is needed. The exercises of the focal point are the basis. We can also work on some traditional keys: The four basic elements (water, air, fire, earth) correspond in fact even to the senses (water = taste, air ? = sense of smell, fire ? = sight, earth ?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve self-fulfillment and be present in reality, it is crucial to cultivate an effective effort of vigilant attention to oneself and one's senses, and to go beyond automatic mechanisms that rob us of the perception of reality. This requires constancy and the development of our senses through exercises and focus on the four basic elements. By doing so, we can begin to separate our emotions, thoughts, and body and connect more deeply with our essence at the center of the cross."
