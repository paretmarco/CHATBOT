  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learnt that our perception of reality is often dulled due to our \"perceptive habit.\" However, in this section on Dynamic Knowledge and Separation of Elements, we explore exercises that can help us attain a state of presence and gain intuitive knowledge. Through Exercise 10, we learn to pay attention to our body and surroundings, while \"separation of elements\" teaches us to perceive sensory realities, emotions, actions, and thoughts as belonging to different dimensions. These exercises can help us deepen our understanding and experience of reality.",
  "content": "Dynamic knowledge of the four elements Exercise 10: Dynamic knowledge While you are walking, you should pay heed to the weight of your body on the earth ?, to the bones that support your structure ?, to your breathing, especially by your chest ?, and to the heat of your body ?. By doing that, you will notice how the meaning of the various symbols clearly unfolds itself to your beings. You would in other words be approximating “intuitive knowledge”. The Separation of the Elements By pressing forward perseveringly, the first phase in the process of “separation of the elements” will take place.
