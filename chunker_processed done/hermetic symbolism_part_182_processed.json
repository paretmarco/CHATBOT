  "title": "\"The Adept Figure: Understanding the Tools of a Magician\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, we delve deeper into the symbolism of the character dressed in red underneath the temple and the plumbline. The character's instruments, such as the caduceus, a golden wand with two serpents coiling around it, and the ring of Hermes, imply that this character must be an Adept figure, learned in the science of Hermes and armed with the powers that the higher initiation confers. Alongside these instruments, we see a closed book and a sacrificial knife in the character's right hand, representing the active side. This text provides fascinating insights into the symbolism of the temple and its various parts, including the character in red, Hiram, and the priest of Isis.",
  "content": "The most notable of these is the caduceus, a golden wand with two serpents coiling around it that represent the contrariwise polarity flows of the great magical agent, known to occultists by the name of Astral Light. The initiate must know how to harness these forces, in order to apply them42 to produce effects that seem miraculous to the layman, who is ignorant of the natural, albeit mysterious, cause. He who is both the son and the lover of Isis, or in other words, the disciple and confidante of Nature, adds the combination of the magic wand and the ring of Hermes to the caduceus. The wand is the image of the subtle conductor that establishes the link with the suprasensory world. Whoever possesses this wand is bestowed with a sort of sixth sense, an invaluable guide in magical operations. The ring, provided by the hermetic Seal, implies participation in the universal alliance of those who know the secrets of the eternal tradition, Kabbala. Alongside these instruments, which are held together in the figureâ€™s left hand, the passive or receptive side, we have also the closed book and the sacrificial knife in the right hand, the active side.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the combination of the magic wand, the ring of Hermes, the closed book, the sacrificial knife, and the magic sword, in the right hands, provides an adept with a powerful set of instruments to harness the forces of the Astral Light and create seemingly miraculous effects. However, it also requires wisdom, knowledge, and skill to use these tools effectively and responsibly, lest they bring about disastrous consequences."
