  "title": "Blind Assessment in the Medical Tug-of-War: Exploring Unconventional Healing Practices",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the history of alternative healing practices and their relationship with conventional medicine. Blind assessment, a tool used to test and prove the scientific legitimacy of unconventional practitioners, was adopted by some healers to showcase their own efficacy. The conflicts between conventional and unconventional medicine that utilized blind assessment included mesmerism and homeopathy. The text also delves into the mysteries surrounding human magnetism and hypnosis, which remain inexplicable by traditional scientific means. Despite differences of opinion, it is evident that these practices do produce results, as evidenced by the numerous cases cited in the text.",
  "content": "In linear terms it is not possible to explain, even if there is evidence of people who have been healed and who have been observed by scientists who admit in an unbiased way that these such phenomena exist. (Meheust). Regular science is still unable to explain what is called ‘human magnetism’. Magnetism is not alone. What is called ‘hypnosis’ is also something which is not very well defined. There are a host of different theories, ranging from the physiological (Hilgard) to the sociological (Wagstaff), but still neither receives general acceptance in the academic community. Differences of opinion on hypnosis and magnetism even today When we enter the ground of hypnosis and animal magnetism we enter a ground where we deal with the human being, and on everything about the human being there is: a host of theories. The only thing we can say for sure, based on our experience and backed up by the many cases cited here, is that there are results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while regular science is still struggling to explain phenomena such as human magnetism and hypnosis, there is evidence of their existence through the healings observed by scientists and experienced by many individuals. Although there is no universal theory to explain these phenomena, the results speak for themselves. The field of hypnosis and animal magnetism remains a place of many theories and different opinions, but one thing is certain: there are measurable and positive outcomes."
