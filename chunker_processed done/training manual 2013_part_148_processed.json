  "title": "\"The Power of Ga-Llama: Discovering Your Individual Breath\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the idea of Ga-Llama being the foundation of our existence was established. Now, the author goes on to explain how we can feel its presence and use it to establish our individual breath. The concept of Mother Breath is introduced and how it decides the capacity of breath we possess in our lifetime. By inhaling and exhaling for seven seconds each, we can establish our Individual Breath and free ourselves from the ban of slavery.",
  "content": "As you follow out these instructions you will more fully understand why at present you possess only the Mother Breath, which Breath, being limited, decrees the time of earth life in accordance with the capacity of Breath entertained by the mother at time of conception. Thus it is that a person apparently in perfect health may be called to Abraham's bosom whether prepared or not to meet the Great Gatherer beyond the mystic portals. As soon as that Mother Breath comes to an end, the last sigh has escaped. The Mother Breath also decides the conditions and environments of existence, and you only free yourself from this ban of slavery by establishing your Individual Breath, and to this end you take up this work. To make this exercise plainer, so that no one may err, your attention is called to the fact that the Individual Breath requires the inhalation of seven seconds, and the exhalation of an equal period.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, by practicing this breathing exercise of inhaling and exhaling for seven seconds, three times a day, for a total of nine minutes, you can establish your Individual Breath, free yourself from the limitations of the Mother Breath, and create a better body and conditions for yourself. Remember to avoid practicing this exercise half an hour after meals, and take charge of your breath to live a healthier life."
