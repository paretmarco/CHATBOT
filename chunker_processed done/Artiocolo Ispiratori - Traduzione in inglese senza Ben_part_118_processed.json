  "title": "The Mysterious Sensibility of Virgilio.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the exceptional abilities of Virgilio, a man with heightened sensibility that allows him to feel others and identify the location of water and hidden objects. The author draws a comparison of Virgilio's actions to that of the mythical being, Medusa, as he maintains control over his subject. The last 200 tokens describe exercises that Virgilio practices to develop his sensibility, including an alternate breathing form and \"hot water and cold water\" exercise. These exercises, along with his heightened sensibility and ability to feel others, give Virgilio a special, fascinating power, useful in his city.",
  "content": "In this connection, he has taught us both an alternate form of breathing, similar to the one utilized in Yoga, though stripped of the need to count one’s breaths, and an exercise termed “hot water and cold water”, which consists in placing one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, and in inverting one’s sensations. Both of them, we must say, are useful exercises. Virgilio, moreover, has let us witness corroborating proofs of his abilities to “feel” others. His heightened sensibility is after all one of the keys to his special fascinating power. Virgilio sees himself first and foremost as a painter, and his paintings display indeed a distinct sensibility. He has an exceptional ability to identify the location of water, and that enables him to discover both hidden sources of water and hidden objects, a highly useful quality in his city.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio's teachings on breathing and the \"hot water and cold water\" exercise are valuable exercises that can benefit anyone. His heightened sensibility and ability to locate hidden objects and water make him a unique individual with a special fascinating power. He sees himself as a painter first and foremost, preferring to give his paintings as gifts rather than selling them. Despite keeping a low profile, his contributions to his community and the world of art are undeniable."
