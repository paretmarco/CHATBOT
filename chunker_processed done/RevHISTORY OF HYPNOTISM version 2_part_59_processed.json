Anton Mesmer was born on 23 May 1734, in the village of Iznang near Radolfszell, which lies by the shores of Lake Constance in Swabia. Radolfszell in an antique postcard He attended the school run by the Jesuits, both on account, ostensibly, of the protection extended to him by the Bishop of Constance, which Mesmer’s father served as his personal forester, and on account of the brilliant innate qualities of his intellect.
