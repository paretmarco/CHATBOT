  "title": "\"Attaining Self-Awareness: The Importance of Eliminating Useless Thoughts\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author emphasized the importance of eliminating useless thoughts as the first step towards self-consciousness. Only by removing cluttering thoughts, individuals can gain greater control and power over their lives, and make choices that help them achieve their goals. In the last 200 tokens, the author presents \"Exercise 1: I am\" as a way to acquire awareness of one's being by detaching it from all the labels and ideas connected to it. The exercise is the first step towards transcending the linguistic dimension of life, and becoming more in tune with one's true reality.",
  "content": "Being ourselves more, in fact, is in itself a choice. Therefore, the essential thing for every person is to reach a state allowing us to choose, decide, and act for the sake of realizing our goals. Exercise 1: I am Through this exercise, we simply try to acquire awareness of our own being. We pronounce the words “I am” to ourselves. What feeling is generated in your body? Acceptance of that “I am”, by detaching it from all the ideas which are connected to it and yet do not belong to it, is the basis for developing the entire spectrum of one’s capabilities. Sometimes, in fact, we say “I am a doctor”, “I am a student”, and so on, yet our true reality antedates any term which we can insert into the verbal phrase “I am”. This exercise, which is exclusively linguistic in character, will ready you for the next stage, where even the linguistic dimension of life is going to be transcended.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the simple exercise of saying \"I am\", we can detach ourselves from the external labels and ideas we identify with and tap into our true reality. This awareness can lead us to a state of presence and direct consciousness of the universe, which is the ultimate freedom. With commitment and practice, we can achieve this state of being and make choices from a place of empowerment and authenticity."
