  "title": "The Symbolism of Geometric Shapes in Hermeticism and Masonry.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explains the symbolic meanings of Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury in Hermeticism, particularly in relation to the Great Work of achieving spiritual purification and enlightenment. The author also discusses the importance of the Square as a symbol of balance and wholeness. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the connection between the Square and the perfectly balanced individual, and how this ideal is realized in the work of the artist and the initiatic program of the Masons. The Hanged Man in Tarot and the Plutonic symbol of Sulphur are also discussed in relation to achieving the Great Work. Overall, the text provides an in-depth exploration of symbols and concepts in Hermeticism and their relevance to personal and spiritual development.",
  "content": "The Square Concrete matter, in other words, that which is perceptible to the senses, is given the symbol of the rectangle, whose four sides correspond to the quaternary of the Elements. When this figure takes the form of a perfect Square , it represents the Cubic Stone, or the perfectly balanced individual, in full possession of himself, whose organism is exactly attuned to all the demands of the spirit. The artist must realise this ideal in the most brilliant phase of his work, when the physical vigour in him is still combined with the delicacy that occurs with ones first impressions. In the initiatic program of the Masons, the Companion phase corresponds to the same period, being more propitious than any other to work and action. Thus the Companion has to transform himself allegorically into a faultless cube, with edges of exactly the same length, and the angles between the surfaces being perfectly equal and straight. These geometric requirements cannot but take on a higher moral meaning in the eyes of the symbolic Workers, who consider themselves to be the living materials of the Temple that they build. The requirements also indicate the level of meticulous attention required to work the material that goes into the Great Work.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, achieving the ideal of being a faultless cube with edges of equal length and angles between surfaces being equal and straight takes on greater moral meaning in the eyes of symbolic workers. This requires meticulous attention to regulate and coordinate every aspect of the Great Work in accordance with the laws of Philosophical Geometry. The right angle plays a critical constructive role in combining geometric symbolism, and every construction derives from linking two opposites. Masons are called to set in motion that which is, by nature, immobile."
