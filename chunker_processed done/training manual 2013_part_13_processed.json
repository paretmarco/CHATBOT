  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the history of alchemy as a tool for bringing one's mind to a different level. The last 200 tokens talk about two relevant figures; Johaness Helmond, who explains alchemical fire as the Son of the Sun, and Apollonius of Tyana, who prayed to the sun and believed in its divinity. According to Philostratus, Apollonius believed the sun was the God in person. The text also gives a detailed description of the alchemical fire and its importance in nature.",
  "content": "Without its influence, the intelligence would be weak, the power of the imagination would be dead, the spirit would be unfruitful and the body would be lifeless.\" Apollonius of Tyana was born around 4 BC at Tyana, in Cappadocia, and is last heard of in Ephesus, over 100 years later. Philostratus frequently mentions Apollonius' prayers to the sun, something for which we do not find antecedents in the Pythagorean literature. “For he said that, whereas other men only make conjectures about the divinity and make guesses that contradict one another concerning it, -- in his own case he said that Apollo had come to him acknowledging that sun was the God in person” (Flavius Philostratus, The Life Of Apollonius Of Tyana). Either sunrise or at noon, Apollonius would say the following prayer: \"O thou Sun, send me as far over the earth as is my pleasure and thine, and may I make the acquaintance of good beings, but never hear anything of bad ones, nor they of me.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the influence of the sun and light on our well-being is undeniable. While Apollonius of Tyana's prayers to the sun may not have antecedents in Pythagorean literature, the benefits of sun gazing and artificial light use are widely recognized today. For those seeking improved mental, physical, and spiritual health, these practices may be worth exploring, although caution is advised when it comes to direct sun gazing."
