  "title": "\"Unlocking the Power of Imagination: Techniques and Benefits\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the power of imagination and how it can be used to change one's behavior and habits. We mentioned the experience of Susanna, the author's collaborator, who was able to make a fibroid disappear by imagining its disappearance every night before sleeping. However, using the technique effectively requires a level of awareness and an understanding of the subconscious. In this last part, we will discuss the third stage, which involves projecting the images into physical space. The exercises in this stage aim to help individuals become real and not slaves of their heads, leading to a positive trance state. We will also explore the relationship between the art of imagination and the art of memory.",
  "content": "The third stage: If, after following the instructions, you can easily view the object with your eyes closed, then you are ready for the next step: projection in physical space. Start with projecting the image onto a surface white or dark. Through these exercises, bring your spirit not to be a slave of your head, but to become real. Some call this status “positive trance”. To simplify things, we can tie the apparition to conditioned reflexes. Each position or repeated sound can serve this purpose. Speaking of which, we note the relationship between art of imagination and art of memory. The latter can actually define the ability to invoke to our spirit, at the appropriate time, pictures, events, reasoning and feelings already proven because of a stimulus. The memory is then in «set the mercury», namely, the imagination is normally free and wanders in humans. The passive principle (= A) is determined by the active principle (= D) linked to memory and attention.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing projection exercises and conditioning reflexes, we can enhance our imagination and memory, which are essential for the education of the human spirit. Utilizing symbols and mandalas can also help us increase our fascinative force. So, let your spirit be free and explore the limitless possibilities of your imagination."
