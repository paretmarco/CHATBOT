  "title": "Exercises for Improving Focus and Mindfulness",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author introduced the concept of mindful exercising, stressing that focusing on performing an exercise correctly is more important than the performance itself. The author suggested switching exercises instead of prolonging them and provided two exercises - arm folding and finger swinging to practice. In the last part of the text, the author introduces exercise ten - \"The Funnel,\" which involves observing the decreasing level of liquid in a bottle with a funnel filled with water and cotton. The exercise aims to improve focus and concentration.",
  "content": "The brain must give sufficient impetus to the movement; attention has to follow this movement until the end. When you have learned to perform well in this exercise, practice it progressively for 2, 3, 4, 5 times. Alternate arms; perform the same by bending the leg on the thigh. Exercise 9 - The finger. Sit comfortably, one hand on the knee, keeping it closed except the middle finger that you will lengthen in the direction of the thigh. Raise and lower the finger slowly for 10, 15, 20 times. The exercise consists in not letting your attention ever detach from the swinging finger, this for longer each time. Exercise 10 - The funnel. Sitting, place in front of you an empty bottle in which you will introduce a glass funnel. In the bottom of the funnel place some cotton wool, then fill the funnel with water. The water then will descend slowly in the bottle filtering through the cotton. The exercise consists in sticking your attention to the decreasing level of liquid.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises can help improve your ability to focus and maintain attention for longer periods of time. It's important to practice them progressively, alternating arms and legs, and resisting distractions. With time and dedication, you may find yourself able to concentrate better not only during these exercises, but also in your daily life."
