  "title": "What are the mesmerizing techniques used to cure illnesses according to historical anecdotes in India?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Esdaile explained a common procedure among his patients called Jar-phoonk, which he discovered through the mesmerisers' continuous stroking and breathing. In this final part, he narrates a curious experience from the Zoist in which a Hindu mendicant cured a sick woman using a religious ceremony called 'mundur.' Esdaile witnessed the ceremony and witnessed the woman fall asleep after constant head-to-feet bead passes, breaths, and hand-laying. The mendicant then called out loudly as if in prayer, and the ritual was complete.",
  "content": "A ‘vergraggey' — mendicant devotee—offered to undertake her cure by performing a religious ceremony, or 'mundur'; and as the family lived in the same building with me and my military detachment, and had no objection to my being present, I attended. The man commenced with the usual Hindoo offerings, such as burning frankincense, breaking a cocoa-nut, and invoking some god, particularly Seetaram, and then seated the woman on the ground with her back and head against the wall, and took from his long matted hair a string of large sandal-wood beads, which he held up before her eyes and directed her to look at; then made passes with it from her head downwards, occasionally stopping to breathe upon or lay his hands upon her chest. She soon became drowsy, and appeared to sleep, when a handful of wood ashes were called for, waved over her head, thrown in the air, and the charm was pronounced complete. He then retired to a little distance and sat counting his beads, but with his eyes attentively fixed on her, and muttering as if in prayer. In about half an hour he started up, snapped his fingers, called out loudly ‘Seetaram!'",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the practice of religious ceremonies such as the 'mundur' may seem unorthodox to some, it appeared to have been successful in curing the woman's ailment. However, as with any such procedure, it is important to approach the situation with a healthy dose of skepticism while also remaining open-minded to alternative forms of healing."
