  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psi aims to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western traditions, and it has been found that a comparable personal approach exists in many ancient traditions such as Dzogchen, Yoga, and Ch'an techniques. Readers are encouraged to explore these traditions by reading books on topics such as enneagrams, hypnosis, quantum physics, and energy techniques, as these have served as a starting point for Quantum Psi's advanced research."
