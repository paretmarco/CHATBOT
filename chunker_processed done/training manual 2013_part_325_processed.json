  "title": "\"Exercises for Developing Self-Consciousness and Presence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of developing self-consciousness by subordinating automatic responses to awareness. Two exercises are mentioned, with Exercise 6 focusing on being conscious of breathing while eating, and Exercise 7 involving being aware of talking. The author speaks about the process needed to develop self-consciousness, which involves aligning decisions with resultant actions. A simple example is given of a student being tempted to shelve their studies to join their friends outside, but knowing that only dedicated studying will enable them to succeed in their upcoming exam.",
  "content": "If you speak WHILE LISTENING TO YOUR OWN SELVES TALKING, your voice will become clearer and neater. THE GENERAL IDEA OF AUTOMATIC RESPONSES BEING SUBORDINATED TO AWARENESS. – The process needed to develop self-consciousness also passes through the attainment of an alignment between decisions that are taken and resultant actions. A simple example shall clearly disclose the game played by these two centers of personality: A student sits down in order to study. Outside, the sun is shining and, from a half-open window, the echo of thousands of joyous noises reaches him together with delightful buffets of fresh air. Our youngster is tempted to shelve aside the annoying book and go out to meet his friends. However, this motion generated by his automatic side, this « impulse», clashes with a resistence on the part of the youth: The exam, with its most heavy program, is drawing close; only an assiduous engrossment in study will enable him to assimilate such program in full.",
  "last_phrase": "Remembering ourselves and achieving self-consciousness is an essential step towards gaining control over our actions and rising above unconscious behavior. By aligning our decisions with our actions and systematically dominating our impulses, we can develop a central principle and regain mastery over ourselves. Through this process, we can unlock our full conscious and unconscious potential, enabling us to soar to greater heights."
