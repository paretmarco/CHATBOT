  "title": "Method for the Hypnotic Magnetic Gaze in 6 Steps.",
  "first_phrase": "In this article, we explore Deleuze's first method of inducing hypnosis using a simple yet effective magnetic gaze. Before delving into the method, the author provides a few instructions from speaking as little as possible to exercising your gaze ahead of time. The method involves the patient sitting down in an easiest position, with the practitioner sitting before them with their knees and feet placed in a specific way. The method requires the practitioner to perform meditation before beginning the process, which helps them enter a state of mental emptiness. They are then to steady their gaze on the patient and take their thumbs between their fingers until there is an equal degree of warmth between them.",
  "content": "He then recommends both parties to remain in this position until the warmth of their hands are about equal; that is to say, until the caloric is in equilibrium in the two organizations, and which is generally effected in a few minutes. During this interval, it is scarcely necessary to state that thought is busy, and that the will impresses its action on the vital fluid, which is transmitted by the operator, his fingers serving, for this purpose, as conductors while moving along the patient's arms. 4. Have your patient sit down in the easiest position; seat yourself before him if possible, in a seat which is a little more elevated, so that his knees may be between yours and your feet beside his. Ask him to be in an easy and passive state. 5. After having brought yourself into a state of self-collectedness, take his thumbs between your two fingers, so that the inside of your thumbs may touch the inside of his; steadily fix your eyes upon him, and remain in this situation for a few minutes, until you perceive there is an equal degree of warmth between your thumbs and his.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing the techniques outlined by Deleuze can lead to a state of relaxation and equilibrium in both the operator and patient. By remaining calm and focused, and with the power of touch and will, the benefits of this practice can be maximized for both parties involved."
