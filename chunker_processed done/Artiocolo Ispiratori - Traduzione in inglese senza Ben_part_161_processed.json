  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned that Jean Pierre de Giudicelli has a remarkable capacity to comprehend the essence of everything: Presence. To him, presence is crucial in restoring man to his true self and solving most problems. He even learned valuable techniques from a powerful magnetist named Pastor, including an exercise based on breathing. In this final part, we'll explore further the exercises that Jean Pierre learned, including the use of mirrors and the reawakening of the kundalini.",
  "content": "At that point, we would be operating at a higher and reinvigorating level. Jean Pierre de Giudicelli had the additional chance of meeting in Corsica a most potent magnetist, a certain Pastor, who was able to accomplish very powerful results in the field of healing. The town doctor used to lend him his study in order for him to work from it, such were his plainly discernible abilities. Pastor supplied Jean Pierre de Giudicelli with the essential keys for his method. One exercise he would recommend, and which he deemed essential, was one based on breathing. In order to achieve curative results, it is in fact necessary to know how to develop within oneself a special kind of enthusiasm and energy. That exercise is also part and parcel of our courses, and takes its place alongside a variety of exercises of Egyptian origin which make use of mirrors and which lead in a short period of time to reawaken the Hermetic caduceus, a.k.a. the kundalini, if one prefers to borrow the Indian terminology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a special kind of enthusiasm and energy through exercises like breathing is essential for achieving curative results in magnetic healing. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli explored various traditions and attaining higher states of presence. The recognition of presence as the absolute key to progress is crucial in this journey, as discussed in the books \"The Mystery of Time\" and \"Magnetism and the Energetic Ascent.\" Keep pursuing the path of presence for continued growth and progress."
