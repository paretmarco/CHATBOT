  "title": "\"The Importance of Peeling Back Emotional Layers in Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of emptiness within oneself and how different therapeutic approaches can be used to access it. Before reaching the last 200 tokens, the author explains Wilhelm Reich's body armor concept and Kundalini yoga's approach to the seven bifurcation points in the body. The therapist works with the client to peel back layers of her obsessive identity and uncover the underlying fear and worthlessness. In the final part, the focus shifts to the client's stomach as they continue to explore their inner emptiness.",
  "content": "In Kundalini yoga on the other hand, the work is from the root Chakra (bifurcation point) at the base of the spine through seven bifurcation points (called Chakras) up to the crown of the head. It used to be said, jokingly, Kundalini yoga works from sex to God (upward from the root Chakra), and William Reich works from God to sex (from the eyes downward). Of course, this presupposes that the pelvis is further away from God than thelead. In this case I chose the Reichian perspective because of her problems with men. Therapist: If you peeled back the layer of this obsessive Identity, what is underneath it? Client: Fear. Therapist: Feel the fear as energy. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now if you peeled back the fear, what is beneath it? Client: An empty feeling of worthlessness. Therapeutic Note She defines emptiness as worthlessness, when emptiness is just emptiness. This means that you never stop peeling layers until the emptiness is reached. Therapist: If you peel back the worthlessness, what is there? Client: Emptiness. Therapist: Now, let's go down to your stomach.",
  "last_phrase": "The therapeutic process of peeling back layers to discover underlying emotions and sensations can be useful in addressing problems with identity, fear, worthlessness, overeating, and loneliness. By continuing this process until reaching the underlying feeling of emptiness, one may gain a deeper awareness and understanding of themselves."
