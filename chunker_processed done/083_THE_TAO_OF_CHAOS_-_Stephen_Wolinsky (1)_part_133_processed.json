  "title": "\"Exercises in Tao of Chaos and Chaotic Contemplation\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the illusion of time and how it relates to our experiences, emotions, and states of consciousness. It introduces the concept of the Tao of Chaos and outlines an exercise aimed at unifying internal and external energy. The final section emphasizes that the unification of energy leads to the elimination of boundaries and unification of consciousness. The text concludes with a quote by George Harrison, stating that all things must pass, including our experiences, emotions, and states of consciousness. It reminds us to embrace the present moment and let go of our attachment to the illusion of time.",
  "content": "Past is followed by present is followed by future. With each coming of an event, however, we somehow enter into one of time's great illusions. Time has a great illusion which is when an experience, such as an emotion, or thought, or state of consciousness is present, we feel it will last forever. For example, when you are \"in love\" you feel it will last forever, when you are depressed you feel it will last forever, when you are anxious or angry you feel it will last forever. Objectively speaking, however, we \"know\" it will pass, but while we are identified with an experience we assume that it will never end. This is time's great illusion, which is contained within experiences. Because of this illusion, we resist experiences. For example, when you are angry or sad, you might resist experiencing these because intrinsic to their nature is the appearance that they will never leave. On the opposite side, love, we resist losing the feeling, try to keep it, check it, get it back, or work at bringing it back which is a way to resist its time-bound nature.",
  "last_phrase": "Remembering the transience of everything, including our states of consciousness, can help us avoid being trapped in time's great illusion. By contemplating the impermanence of everything we perceive or conceive, we can learn to let go of our resistance to experiences and embrace life as it unfolds, moment by moment. So, take a moment to contemplate this - without using memory, mind, or associations, who were you before you were born?"
