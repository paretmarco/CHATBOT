  "title": "\"Exploring Consciousness Through Vertigo and Abyss: The Fourth Stage\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this philosophical text, the author reflects on the experience of vertigo and how it can be harnessed as a tool for personal growth. They discuss how panic can hinder progress, but in an evolved person, it can be transformed into curiosity. The detachment from the body allows for a perception of space that can be controlled by will. The author also contemplates the concept of self, acknowledging the limitations of words and the failure of imagination in grasping certain states of consciousness. The text ends with a quote from Dante, emphasizing the impossibility of perfectly conveying such experiences through language.",
  "content": "I am here; that which would be me, is there, but that is not I who I'm here, but I know also that I'm not here - and so on reasoning or unreasoning, feeling at once one, two, three, because at some point, one realizes that even duality is overcome, and is aware of a quid contemplating himself, outside himself without nor confused with the body, neither ... with himself. ... It is better to say with Dante, \"the high fantasy here will fail \"since it is absolutely impossible, at a common level, in an ordinary state, to only conceive certain states of consciousness anyway certainly true in their apparent absurdity; and impossible it is also with the small power of words to give perfectly the fullness of such perceptions, in which mathematics and logic, the two columns that support the human building, become simple abstractions. \"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey to the fourth stage beyond the abyss requires identifying with it, overcoming fear of madness, and pushing oneself to the extreme. With the perfect calm that comes from intense vertigo, one can gradually detach from physical reality until it disappears almost entirely. While impossible to fully convey with words, this realization can lead to a greater understanding of ourselves and the world around us."
