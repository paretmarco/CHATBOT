  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, it was shown how Lucy Clarke was cured of her fits through magnetism under the treatment of Baron Dupotet. In the last 200 tokens, we learn about Baron Dupotet's method for recharging plexuses in the body, which he believed to develop energy and achieve results in magnetism. Specifically, the instructions for recharging the cervical plexus (forehead) are given, which require sitting in a cross-legged position in front of a mirror. This practical exercise is a glimpse into the techniques used by Baron Dupotet in his magnetic treatments.",
  "content": "In the month of November she received a very severe blow on the head, which she said would protract her cure one month. The girl has had no fits since the day she was first magnetised, and, until this last month, has taken no medicine. The Baron still magnetises her once a week. For the blow she received on the head it was found necessary twice to bleed her, which was done, at her own request, during her magnetic state of insensibility. Reports of other cases treated magnetically in the public hospitals, and also in private practice, are being daily communicated to Baron Dupotet.131 Practical exercise: Some power practices taught by Baron du Potet The plexuses in magnetism are special zones in the body. We must recharge them in order to develop ENERGY, and to obtain the results described in the preceding pages. Du Potet was a person of extreme energy! Here are the instructions for recharging some plexuses in accordance with Du Potetâ€™s method 132: How to recharge the cervical plexus (forehead). Place yourselves in a cross-legged position in front of a mirror (A wardrobe mirror would be excellent).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism therapy proved to be a successful treatment for the young girl's fits and her progress has been consistent until the unfortunate blow she received on her head. Baron Dupotet's remarkable energy and techniques have yielded positive results in other cases as well. Recharging plexuses using his methods can help individuals develop energy for therapeutic purposes."
