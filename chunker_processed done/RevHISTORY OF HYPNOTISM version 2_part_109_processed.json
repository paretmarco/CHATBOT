  "title": "\"Animal Magnetism and Deliberate Insensibility: The Controversial Experimentation\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text concludes an examination of the French Royal Commission's response to Franz Mesmer's claims of animal magnetism. The commissioners deliberately avoided becoming inwardly focused, in order to test Mesmer's claims that his magnetic fluid could produce physical sensations in his patients. Only one commissioner reported any negative effects - a pain in his belly that he attributed to the pressure of the magnetizer. However, some of the phenomena witnessed by the commissioners were so surprising that they defied explanation.",
  "content": "Nothing is more astonishing,\" says the report, \"than the spectacle presented by these convulsions, by the sympathies which are established between the parties, and which we cannot explain by the causes above-mentioned.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Jussieu's separate report led to controversial debates among the scientific community and sparked further research on the concept of a universal fluid that could produce positive actions on the human body. While the existence of such a fluid was not proven, Jussieu's findings urged scientists to explore the possibilities of this agent, leading to a better understanding of its true actions and its potential uses in medicine."
