  "content": "Hermetism, Alchemy and Animal Magnetism Hermetic Alchemy is an influential philosophical tradition. It is also diffused in India and China with similar forms. Even there, it has always been very secretive and it is only recently that some more clear works have been published. We recommend the works of Mantak Chia for understanding the form this discipline took in Orient. Some authors believe that all these alchemies (Taoist, Indian and western) have a common origin18. In any case, the concepts are the same. In general, alchemists believe in a natural and symbolic unity of humanity with the cosmos. The defining objectives, include not only the creation of the fabled philosopher's stone, possessing powers including the capability of turning base metals into the noble metals gold or silver- as well as an elixir of life conferring youth and immortality. The alchemists were wont to view their discipline as consisting in an inward development. They used to say that the totality of Nature was interrelated and that man was not separated from it but was rather a part thereof. One of the sayings among them was the following: “You will never make the one until you have first become one with yourself”19.",
