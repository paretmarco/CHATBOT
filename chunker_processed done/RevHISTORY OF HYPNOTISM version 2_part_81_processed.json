  "content": "These concepts are very similar to quantum concepts: “particles are merely local condensation of the field. Einstein said, We may therefore regard matter as being constituted by the region of space in which the field is extremely intense. There is no place in this new kind of physics, both for the field and matter, for the field is only the matter” (Capek, 1961:319) These same concepts are found in Chinese philosophy: “When the chi condenses, its visibility becomes apparent so that the shapes of individual things are seen. Whereas when it disperses, its visibility is no longer apparent and there are no shapes. The Great Void cannot but consist of Chi; this Chi cannot but condense to form all things; and these things cannot but become dispersed, so as to form (once more) the Great Void” (Fung, 1958: 279-228) For Mesmer everything is flux even if at a broader level we see a fixed universe. Mind in its wholeness can touch and influence this deeper level. It is in this deeper level that instant communication is possible.",
