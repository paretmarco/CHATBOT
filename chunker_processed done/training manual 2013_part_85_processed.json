  "first_phrase": "This text explores the connection between our solar plexus and emotions, discussing how our thoughts and approach to the world affect our balance. The importance of awakening the solar plexus and the heart in internal alchemical teaching is emphasized. The text also explains how passes and magnetism can stop the vicious cycle caused by unbalanced thoughts and emotions. The last 200 tokens delve into the use of fascination to activate the enteric brain, separating it from the worrying brain and allowing for a more balanced state. The concepts of the solar plexus, hara, and enteric brain are the main focus, with the names of the authors or practitioners being omitted.",
  "content": "But if the problem is not something that could be solved the work will become overwork starting a very dangereous vicious circle that will damage the system and even any possibility of finding solutions.

Accessing the enteric brain through sensory isolation and using fascination to deactivate the thinking worrying brain can also help in achieving balance. And as the ancient alchemists said, the key to well-being is accessing the interior part of ourselves, including our enteric part. Remembering VITRIOLUM can guide us in finding the true medicine for ourselves."
