  "first_phrase": "In the concluding section of this text, we delve into the basic premises of the \"Tao of Chaos\". The author points out that resistance to chaos is a common phenomenon in our lives that often leads to various fantasies or attempts to order it. They introduce three critical premises: allowing and acknowledging chaos, recognizing that everything is made of energy, and understanding that change is resistance. By accepting and experiencing chaos as just a part of energy, instead of trying to control or eliminate it, individuals can change their perspective and find ways to move through it.",
  "content": "In all of its forms out-of-control, overwhelmed, emptiness, feeling crazy, etc., there is an attempt to order the chaos. Fantasies can enable or help us to go to a doctor or to work hard or maybe to leave a relationship and find another one. But all of these are attempts to order chaos. There is an extraordinary resistance to experiencing just pure chaos. So what are the basic premises that we are going to use? Premise 1: Allowing and Acknowledging. Allowing chaos to be seen as energy dissipates the structure and allows the \"chaos\" just to be there. Premise 2: Everything is made of energy. Rather than labeling chaos or craziness in our life as something to get rid of, something to reframe, something to relabel, something to change, one has to begin by seeing it and experiencing it as made of energy. Premise 3: Change is Resistance. Chaos must be allowed to be there as energy with no intention or goal of getting rid of the chaos. If you are trying to get rid of chaos then you have a judgment that chaos is something you wish to get rid of...which is again resistance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to acknowledge and allow chaos to exist as a form of energy rather than resisting it. By embracing chaos and adding energy of awareness at strategic points, we can reorder habitual patterns and find new ways to thrive amidst the chaos."
