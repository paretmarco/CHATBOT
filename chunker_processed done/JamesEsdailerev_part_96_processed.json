  "title": "\"The Therapeutic Benefits of Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "Mesmerism, a technique that renders a person insensitive to pain and resembling a corpse without causing harm, shows substantial promise in the treatment of numerous medical conditions. Dr. Esdaile noted that he had cured a majority of his seventy-four mesmerised patients according to Dr. Kean. Mesmerism has various benefits in therapeutics, such as rapidly extinguishing nervous pains, halting convulsions, and aiding inflammation resolution, rendering it an effective tonic for instances of functional debilitation of the nervous system.",
  "content": "He says of Mesmerism, when it can be introduced in the treatment of medical cases:-- \"It is extremely important in instantly extinguishing nervous pains, arresting convulsions, and aiding the natural resolution of inflammation by its anodyne and restorative powers; and, if it could be induced in the commencement of some of the most fatal diseases, it would probably arrest their progress, for it revolutionises the whole system, and every other constitutional affection is for the time suspended. In chronic inflammation it is a useful discutient, gently stimulating the nerves and capillary vessels of the part to more healthy action, and for this purpose local Mesmerism only is required. The chronic exhibition of Mesmerism, as a general tonic in diseases of debility, promises to be of great service, especially in functional derangement of the nervous system, and I am hopeful that we have at last got a direct nervous remedy, hitherto a desideratum in Medicine.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism has shown great promise in its ability to instantly relieve nervous pains, arrest convulsions, and aid in the resolution of inflammation. Mesmerism has also demonstrated its capability of being a useful discutient for chronic inflammation and a general tonic for diseases of debility. Moreover, Mesmeric sleep has the added advantage of not inducing any constitutional derangement, while providing a refreshing and restorative power. Finally, Mesmerism's ability to stimulate the nervous system has proven to be a valuable medical agent even when sleep or coma is not produced."
