  "first_phrase": "This text is all about learning to effectively influence others through magnetic emanation. The author advises readers to cut a piece of paper and hang it on the wall as a target to practice their passes. By raising your arm upwards and bringing it down level with the paper while imagining pushing a person away, you can target specific areas of the subject's body with utmost exactness. These passes can be used effectively in front or behind the subject to influence them.",
  "content": "This is a target for you to shoot your passes at. To practise them stand before it as though it were your Subject. Let your arm hang at your side, which you raise upwards, and rather outwards, describing a circlein the air, bringing it down exactly level with your paper line, having your fingers outstretched. This target may be divided into three by being painted in three coloursâ€”red, blue, and yellow, and then, by the motion of the fringe, produced by the air you bring down with your pass, you will know which particular portion you affect, which practice will cultivate your eye and hand so that you will be able to Magnetise any part of your Subject's body with the utmost exactness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing your passes at a painted target, you can cultivate your eye and hand coordination to magnetize any part of your subject's body with precise accuracy. Always keep in mind the duration and concentration required for effective passes, especially when dealing with long distances or solid barriers. By following these steps, your magnetic healing practice can be both practical and effective."
