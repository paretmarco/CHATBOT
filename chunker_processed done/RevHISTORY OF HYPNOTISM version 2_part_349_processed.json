  "title": "\"How does magnetic sleep work and what are the steps to awaken someone from it?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this passage, the author discusses the process of recognizing magnetic sleep and the stages that follow it. The operator must be attentive to the subject's face and swallowing patterns to determine if they are in a torpid state, natural sleep, or magnetic sleep. If it is magnetic sleep, the subject will not awaken with noise or sensation. The magnetiser can then ask them questions if they enter somnambulism, a state in which they can hear and reply. However, it is crucial to use the correct techniques to awaken the subject to avoid negative side effects.",
  "content": "The magnetiser may then continue his questions for a few moments, for he must not tire the subject the first time; and then he should awaken him. \"When the magnetiser wishes to awaken the subject, he should make some passes from the shoulders to the feet, in order to free the head by drawing down the fluid. Then, putting some muscular force into the act, he must make long passes before his subject's eyes and face, bringing his hands down the sides, until he gives signs of coming to himself. The subject should then be awake, but not yet in his normal state. The magnetiser should then blow cold on his eyes and pass his fingers along his eyebrows in order to free the eyes. This process must be continued or repeated until the subject is completely de-magnetised. The magnetiser may also make transverse passes over the stomach. The subject should be completely de-magnetised, or headache and heaviness in the limbs may follow later in the day.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you practice magnetism or plan to do it, it is crucial to follow the steps carefully and remain calm during the process. If the subject does not wake up, the operator should take a break, and not panic. With practice, both the magnetizer and the subject can achieve a profound state of unity."
