  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author introduced us to the characteristics of a man who has achieved success. The traits included self-discipline, focus, and seeing life as rules and laws that must be followed. In this final section, the author talks about how this man interacts with people. He has a genuine personality that makes him likable and draws people towards him. However, despite appearing relaxed, this man maintains control of every conversation he has. He is an expert in using other people's strengths to his advantage while keeping them unaware of his intentions. The author implies that the reason for this control is the knowledge of the Law, which this man understands, but others do not.",
  "content": "He keeps you in his domain, and you cannot avoid his influence even after leaving him. 10. He is using your strength. If now you want remember well the conversation you had with him, you will see — although then you did not notice — that you were the one showing your knowledge, you have been the one who tried to please: in a word, you were the one who gave. You gave he received. If he would have wanted it to be otherwise, strong of his consciousness value, he would have forced you to receive from him whatever he would have liked to give you, in terms of impulses, orders, ideas. If he wanted to, he could have made you bend as wind bends the reeds of a pond. Why is that? Because this is the Law, and he knows it, but you ignore it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize when someone is using your strengths and learn to protect yourself.
