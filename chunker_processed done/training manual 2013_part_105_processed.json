  "title": "\"The Art of Curative & Magnetizing Passes\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the author detailed the techniques of Magnetising and Curative Passes that involve the use of Spirit Vapour or fluid-filled hand to transfer energy between the subject and the practitioner. In the final 200 tokens, the author instructs the readers to perform the same process for curative passes but with the added step of shaking the hand at the end of each pass to dispel negative energies. It is crucial to remember that while Magnetising passes focus on distributing positive energy, Curative Passes aim to remove negative energy causing pain or discomfort. All the accumulated pain can be released by ending with the same movement you began.",
  "content": "Curative Passes Practise Curative-passes in exactly the same manner, but with this essential difference: that at the end of each pass you shake your hand, as though it had been dipped in dirty or offensive water, and you wished to dry it by shaking the water off. Remember that a Magnetising-pass is for the purpose of throwing upon, and distributing over the Subject, your Spirit Vapour, with some special object, while the Curative-pass is for the purpose of drawing outwards and downwards an invisible something, which causes pain or annoyance. At the end of the pass you have it in your hand, and if you return to the spot from whence you began the pass, you simply carry back, and accumulate the pain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, remember that using curative passes in the right manner requires the use of shaking your hand at the end of each pass, thereby preventing the accumulation of pain and ensuring that your patient is fully benefited. Also, avoid neglecting this important step to prevent pain and inflammation in your own hand, and you can transfer pain to another person if necessary."
