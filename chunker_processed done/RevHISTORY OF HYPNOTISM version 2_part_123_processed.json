  "title": "The History and Evolution of Magnetism and Hypnotism",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the history of magnetism, beginning with the official recognition of the science of magnetism in the 19th century and the subsequent split of magnetists into different groups with their own systems. The last 200 tokens discusses the evolution of animal magnetism and the rise of related systems such as Braidism, Statusvolism, Pathetism, and Electrical Psychology. These systems merged and gave rise to modern spiritual healing practices and hypnotic practices of today, which can seem chaotic without understanding their historical context.",
  "content": "Pathetism, 4. Electrical Psychology (better known as Electro-biology). These systems differ from both Animal Magnetism and Modern Hypnotism, as well as from each other, although all are closely connected; 1900 -2000 The preceding systems evolved in the 1900s in the following way: Hypnotism (Braidism) merged with a part of Electrobiology in America and gave rise to what was there called “hypnosis” In Europe Hypnotism (Fascination and Braidism) merged with magnetism and gave rise to the concept of “Hypnomagnetism”, which was a very standard practice present before the arrival on the continent of the concepts of American “hypnosis”. In America Pathetism merged with magnetism and gave rise to modern “Spiritual healing practices” In Europe Animal Magnetism continued on its own under the name of “Magnetism”. So all the different systems persisted under different names until today. Unless they are taken into consideration, the Hypnotic practices of our day seem little more than a jumble of conflicting theories and a chaos of unexplained phenomena.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the history of hypnosis, mesmerism, and magnetism is crucial for a comprehensive theory of hypnotic practices. While modern hypnosis may seem like a chaotic merging of conflicting theories and unexplained phenomena, the evolution of these systems paints a clearer picture of the subject's complexity. The existence of animal magnetism is acknowledged, and the data from various systems under different names may shed light on important questions. It is evident that the positivity of the practice is gaining recognition, and it is worth exploring how the power of hypnotism can increase the happiness of humankind when properly directed and controlled."
