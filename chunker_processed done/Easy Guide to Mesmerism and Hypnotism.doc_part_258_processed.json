  "title": "\"The Art of Mesmerism: Uncovering the Secrets of Hypnotic Fascination\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the possibility of \"suggestion\" being an accompanying or facilitating force of mesmeric effects and not their cause. It highlights the limitations of the materialistic view and the need to consider other possibilities. The last 200 tokens discuss training in mesmerism and the search for the secret of hypnotic fascination. The authors investigated the field of hypnosis, NLP and met with experts but couldn't find the secret. They turned to studying old texts and discovered a different understanding of hypnotism that modern hypnotizers couldn't replicate.",
  "content": "Even though we were very good friends with this man, he didn’t want to teach it to us. He said it was a secret. He started the first part of the teaching, and afterwards stopped it. We also began a search of the entire world to find somebody else who knew the secret. We met Gil Boyne, Ormond Mc Gill, and many other hypnotists, but none had perfected the technique and many even denied its existence. Ormond Mc Gill, as we spoke with him, said he had heard of some people able to do it, but that he personally could not. We investigated the field of NLP, meeting Richard Bandler and John Grinder but they didn't have the secret either. During this time we had become tremendous experts in the field of hypnosis, NLP etc... But, nevertheless, we didn't have the secret either. So, we went back and we began to study the old texts of hypnotism of the 1800’s and beginning of the 1900’s and we began to understand something. As usual, many of these texts spoke of feats that no modern hypnotizer was able to do in the way these old texts said.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, after years of searching and studying, we finally obtained the secret to mesmerism and now share it with the world. To make it work, you must accept the supernatural or the power of the mind and rely on thoughts rather than words. Remember, mesmerism is not just a single technique; it's a system that requires complete acceptance and understanding."
