  "title": "The Curiosity and Controversy Surrounding Mesmer's Healing: An Overview.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the text, the author described several successful healings by Mesmer. In this final part, the author further elaborates on Mesmer's mesmerizing skills by sharing a few curious anecdotes. The mentioned feats include causing physical sensations in people from a distance and making people faint by pointing his cane at them. Two girls chasing him in the woods were also prevented from advancing by his gesture. These bizarre happenings have been reported by Thouret in his \"Recherches et Doutes\".",
  "content": "At this distance, M. Camp*** experienced an attack of the asthma, and M. d'E*** a pain in the side, to which he was subject. Some persons have been seen who were not able to sustain the experiment without fainting. One day Mesmer was walking in the woods of the country beyond Orleans. Two girls taking advantage of the freedom of the country, went ahead of the company to chase him. He began to run; but suddenly turning round, he presented his cane towards them, forbidding them to come further: immediately their knees bent under them, and they could not advance. One evening Mesmer went into the garden of M. le prince de Soubise, with six persons. He prepared a tree, and a short time after, M'me la M. de ***, and Mesdemoiselles de Pr*** and P*** fell senseless. M'me la D*** de T*** held on to the tree without power to leave it. M. le C*** de Mons* was obliged to sit down on a bank, not being able to sustain himself on his limbs.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, despite facing opposition and disbelief, Mesmer's experiments with magnetism led to the discovery of a power that could potentially benefit humanity. However, it is important to approach the practice with caution and proper control to ensure its safe and effective use."
