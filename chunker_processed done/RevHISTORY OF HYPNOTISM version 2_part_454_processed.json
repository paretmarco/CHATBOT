  "title": "Who Were the Trailblazers of Mesmerism and Why Was England Late to Acknowledge It?",
  "first_phrase": "This part of the text outlines the author's frustration with the lack of recognition of Mesmerism in England. He acknowledges that the practice has been established for thirty years on the continent, thanks to the efforts of Puysegur, Deleuze, and their associates. Meanwhile, individuals like Hufeland, Humboldt, and Cuvier, distinguished physicians and scientists, have provided valuable data on the subject. The author hopes that England will no longer be seen as ignorantly dismissive of Mesmerism.",
  "content": "He wrote:- \"The reporters of the facts in question are, for the most part, men whose intellectual attainments in general are known to have been of a superior order, and whose moral character is elevated far above suspicion; men, in short, far more honourable and trustworthy than their wretched, chiefly anonymous caluminators.158 They will be found to be chiefly eminent physicians, such as Hufeland, physician to the king of Prussia; Steiglitz, physician to the king of Hanover; Brandis, physician to the king of Denmark; Klein, physician to the king of Wirtemberg; Wienholt; Olbers, the Astronomer; Gmelin; Heineken; Bockman; Baehrens; Ennemmoser; Sprengel, author of a history of Medicine, and other learned works; Haindorf; Nolte; Spindler; Nasse; Nees von Esenbbeck; Passevant; Zierman; Heinroth; Leupoldt, &c. - Physiologists, such as Reil; Trevarinus; Autenrieth; Humboldt; Burdach; Eschenamayer; Kiezer, &c.- Naturalists, such as La Place; Cuvier; Oken.- Philosophers, such as Fichte; Schelling; Steffens; Baader; Hegel, &c.-Theologians, such as Schleiermacher; Mayer, &c. To these might be added a vast number of men of general science and celebrated literary characters.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the credibility of the facts presented by Esdaile is undeniable, as they were recorded by reputable and knowledgeable individuals, including physicians, naturalists, philosophers, theologians, and literary figures. Despite objections made regarding their interests in animal magnetism, these individuals were the only ones capable of investigating the phenomena and providing objective accounts of their experiences. Esdaile's belief in the \"vital agent\" may have been his own, but it was grounded in his personal experiences and observations."
