  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the concept of \"natural state\" and how man's development can only begin with himself and his physical-sensory reality. Now, we dive deeper into the path suggested by this concept, which consists of a scheme involving the integration of perceptive consciousness through various levels of biological vitality, spirit, and energy. Each level is associated with specific exercises and ways of perceiving ourselves and the universe. The first level, called the quaternary, involves learning to silence conceptualizations and starting from primary sensations, also known as the \"initial development of the presence.\" Join us as we explore this path of self-development and natural perception.",
  "content": "receptiveness, and later extends to the next levels of biological vitality, as well as the vitality of the spirit and the “energetic” body, in order for it to eventually reach the globality of man. For every ladder, apposite exercises will be indicated. The applicable scheme is the following: These levels are linked to specific ways of perceiving ourselves and the universe. The first level (the quaternary), in fact, refers to the integration of the perceptive consciousness. We must learn to silence the “conceptualizations” which preclude us from seeing the world. The key to that is to start in a very simple manner from the “primary sensations”, which are elements that are nevertheless present in our experience. This is what we call “initial development of the presence”.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, developing our receptiveness to our primary sensations and external surroundings is the key to reaching higher levels of biological and spiritual vitality. By silencing conceptualizations and practicing focused attention, we can overcome automatic mechanisms that impede our perception of reality. With consistent effort and the application of traditional techniques, we can integrate our perceptive consciousness and expand our awareness of the universe, ultimately achieving the globality of man."
