  "title": "\"Continuing the Path: Steps Toward Lucid Dreaming\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the concept of persisting in an experiment in darkness was introduced, leading to the emergence of a new world of perception. However, the journey is far from over, and the path becomes increasingly difficult. The individual must fight and dominate hallucinations, while also noting a feeling of vertigo. The will must operate in a specific way, allowing the sensation to persist but maintaining a sense of power and passivity. Moving on to the third stage, those who are able to overcome the risk of succumbing to vertigo will become aware of two realities and transcend their ego, like walking above water.",
  "content": "This requires that the will operates in a very particular way, maintaining a sense of power and passivity, a sense of firm and tenacious immobility. After, in this superior state the sensation of vertigo could even be voluntarily increased in intensity and be brought to a superior level, near to the loss of consciousness. THIRD STAGE - LUCID DREAMING IN WAKING STATE (??) If you are able to be present you will be able to reach a further step. In this step you will become aware at the same time of two realities and you will be beyond the normal ego, above the flow of dreaming thoughts that are created by your abitual being. Those who are able to overcome the point in which they risked to succomb to the vertigo and be carried over by the flow of dreams, they will be like walking above the waters.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, reaching a state of lucid dreaming in the waking state requires a combination of willpower and passivity, as well as a firm and tenacious immobility. Overcoming the intense sensation of vertigo and being present in the moment allows one to become aware of two realities and move beyond the normal ego, leading to the ability to consciously navigate the gap between physical reality and the dream world. While there are various techniques to achieve this state, it is important to use caution and seek gradual development of control to avoid any dangerous consequences."
