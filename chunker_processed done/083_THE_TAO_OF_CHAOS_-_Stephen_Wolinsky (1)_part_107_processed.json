  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author details the Tao of Chaos, emphasizing the importance of not resisting the disappearance or reappearance of any state. Upholding this principle is achieved by understanding that all states are merely appearances and disappearances of emptiness, and that as such, they are not permanent. In the last 200 tokens, the author concludes that chaos is simply the explicate order becoming the implicate order, and that everything in the universe, from thoughts to chairs, has a certain amount of energy. This text mentions the concept of quantum consciousness, the philosophy of Nisargadatta Maharaj and offers an exercise to help readers experience the concept of condensed emptiness.",
  "content": "This that you call you is a sample of this universal consciousness which is the absolute nothing.\" The Tao of Chaos is not to resist the appearance or disappearance of any state; none are permanent, they are really phenomenological occurrences with no cause, effect, or location. The nothing appears and disappears randomly and is ordered in emptiness. This allowing and understanding is the Tao of Chaos. Tao of Chaos Exercise #17 Eyes closed. Step I Notice the emptiness that surrounds you. Step II Experience yourself as condensed emptiness. Step III Experience all the objects in the room as condensed emptiness. Step IV Experience yourself and all objects in the room as being made of the same condensed emptiness. 76 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS Conclusion The underlying unity or the implicate order orders chaos. Chaos is merely a description of the explicate order becoming the implicate order. E verything in the universe from thoughts to chairs, from skin to emotions, has a certain amount of energy. Let's say for example I have a thought called \"I feel bad.\" That thought has a particular amount of energy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and allowing the appearance and disappearance of all states without resistance is the Tao of Chaos. By experiencing ourselves and all objects as condensed emptiness and understanding the underlying unity, we can tap into the energy that exists within everything and create positive changes in our lives. The Psychotherapy of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. further reinforces this concept by adding energy to states like depression to bring about change."
