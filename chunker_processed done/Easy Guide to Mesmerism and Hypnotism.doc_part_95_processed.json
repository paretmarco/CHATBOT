  "title": "\"The Stages of Mesmerism: Understanding the Patient's Psychic Condition\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the different stages of mesmerism, a technique used to induce a trance-like state in patients to treat physical and mental ailments. The first four stages are common in most mesmeric procedures, while the fifth and sixth degrees are rare and indicate a spiritual existence. The patient's ability to diagnose and prescribe remedies in the trance is elevated when placed in rapport with a third person. Not all subjects progress through the different stages in order, nor are they capable of exhibiting all stages. This final section discusses the Independent or spiritual stage, where the patient's vision is not limited by space or sympathy, and they are beyond the operator's control.",
  "content": "This idea is rejected by many of our leading men of science and by all materialists. Spirit is about “the last thing; they can give in to” their thoughts and conceptions of things axe, of necessity, largely moulded by their favourite studies and pursuits in the physical and material. The stages described are not progressive and developed in sensitives in the order indicated, but rather, states produced according to the temperamental condition or peculiarities of organism in persons operated upon, the majority of whom never pass the fourth stage. All phases may be developed in one subject; some may pass rapidly into the fifth or sixth stage without apparently having passed through the others. Some subjects seem to have a natural fitness for one class of phenomena and not another. Those adapted for the higher phases of thought transference, or sympathetic thought-reading, would be degraded or injured (that is, their powers obscured), were they reduced to the buffooneries of the public platform; while those most suited for public entertainments, seldom or never are fitted for the exhibition of the higher stages of the fourth degree, and certainly never for the fifth and sixth.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the development of spiritual phenomena depends largely on the innate abilities and temperamental condition of the subject, and cannot be forced or replicated through mesmerism or other forms of manipulation. Mesmerists should exercise caution and restraint, maintaining a scientific approach and prioritizing the well-being of their sensitive subjects. Ultimately, the manifestation of spiritual phenomena is a complex and multifaceted process that requires patience, respect, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the human psyche."
