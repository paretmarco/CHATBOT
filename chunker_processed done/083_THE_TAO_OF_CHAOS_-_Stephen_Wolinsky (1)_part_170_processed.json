  "title": "\"The Pendulum of I-dentity and the Holy Hole of Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the exploration of the Essence and the importance of the mid-point in the process. The mid-point is the space between two I-dentities, where emotions and trances such as confusion, dissociation, numbness, and fear, are often resisted. The true mid-point, however, is a feeling of nothingness or emptiness, which is the starting point of the pendulum. Essence, where the pendulum begins, is where individuals must look from and make connections to, in order to process the movement of the pendulum. Through the therapy of chaos, individuals must push through the uncomfortable chaos to reach the holy hole of chaos and the perceived emptiness of Essence.",
  "content": "If we take off the layers of emotions, we find the sedate side of chaos, a feeling of nothingness or emptiness. This is the true mid-point and hence the most resisted mid-point. Essence is where the pendulum begins, and as people know, once the psycho-emotional pendulum begins, it is almost impossible to stop it; let alone change its direction. The real change must occur at the point of Essence. Said more simply, Essence is where you must look from and make connections to, in order to process the movement of the pendulum. Fortunately for us, Essence leaves a trace, which is perceived by I-dentities as a hole or gnawing emptiness we resist in the body. This hole is a hole (holy) place where the therapy of chaos must go. But in order to go through that holy hole, the uncomfortable, crazy chaos must be experienced first. The therapy, therefore, will proceed from a person beginning in a conflict, and then take us through the crazy chaos, into the holy hole of chaos into the perceived emptiness of Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing the holy hole of chaos can be unnerving, yet it's where true change and connections to the Essence lie; the point where the psycho-emotional pendulum must be reckoned with. Through therapy and understanding, navigating the pendulum's movements and integrating the Essence can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life."
