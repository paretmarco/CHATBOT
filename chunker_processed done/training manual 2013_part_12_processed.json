  "title": "\"The Power of Light: A Path to Quintessence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we explored the different parts of our consciousness and how to achieve a state of quintessence. Now, let's delve into the power of light, fire and sun as recognized by ancient civilizations and philosophers such as Schiller and Goethe. We'll also see how they've been used in mesmerism and alchemy, and their association with the Tibetan Buddhist notions of Primordial Field and Clear Light. Finally, we'll discover the role of the IGNIS or the fire of the gold as the true goldsulphur and the light of nature.",
  "content": "It is used from immemorial times as a tool for bringing our mind to a different level History Ancient alchemists worked on fire. Alchemical fire shares much with the Tibetan Buddhist notions of Primordial Field and Clear Light. As Johaness Helmond says: \"It is a fire, solar by nature, yet a little coarser than that (the fire) of the heavenly Sun. This is why it is also called the Son of the Sun. He is the archeus of nature who moves and digests the matter, when he is given his Freedom; he does all the work in her (nature). In the interim, the Central-Fire lies hidden under a hard shell, still weak and unable. It is only a Fire in potentia that will show its power as soon as it is awakened through the external Fire. The Alchemists call it IGNIS, or at times, call it their red Lion or Gabritius. It is the fire of the gold, the true goldsulphur, the soul of the elements, and the light of nature.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of fire has been used throughout history to not only represent physical heat and energy but also to symbolize spiritual illumination and enlightenment. From the ancient alchemists to the prayers of Apollonius of Tyana, the power of fire has captivated human imagination and continues to inspire us to this day in our pursuit of higher knowledge and inner transformation."
