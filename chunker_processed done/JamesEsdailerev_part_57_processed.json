  "title": "Animal Magnetism and Its Effects on Health and Consciousness",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the intriguing world of animal magnetism, particularly in its application to the healing of animals. It cites the Comte de Puységur, who successfully healed a severely injured dog through his magnetic passes. The text also delves into the fascinating phenomenon of somnambulism or sleepwalking, which has provided significant contributions to our understanding of the nature of man's existence. The author also explores the concept of magnetic ecstasy, a state of introspective contemplation triggered by magnetic influence.",
  "content": "\"Of all the discoveries,\" said M. Deleuze, \"which have, since the remotest times, excited public attention, that of somnambulism is certainly the best adapted towards enlightening us respecting man's nature and attributes. The phenomena it lays before us demonstrate the distinction of two substances—the twofold existence of the inward man in a single individual, a direct proof of the spirituality of the soul, and a reply to all the objections which have been raised in denying its immortality. They are also evidence of that truth, so well known to the ancients, that man is an intelligence served by organs.\" “The external organs of sense are all, or nearly all, asleep; and yet he experiences sensations, but by another means. There is roused in him an internal sense, which is perhaps the centre of the others, or a sort of instinct, which enlightens him in respect to his own preservation.” Magnetic Ecstasy Another wonderful magnetic phenomenon is magnetic ecstasy. Ecstasy is a state where the mind of the ecstatic does not reflect, it simply contemplates; and the more it contemplates the more absorbed it becomes. Maybe we can trace it back to some hermetic-alchemical practices.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the phenomena of somnambulism and magnetic ecstasy provide insights into the nature of man, particularly the spirituality of the soul and the existence of multiple internal senses. These phenomena also offer a connection to ancient Western and Eastern traditions, which seek to operate and regenerate the human organism. With further research, the understanding of the human mind and body can be enhanced, leading to advancements in various fields, particularly in the study of the nervous and endocrine systems."
