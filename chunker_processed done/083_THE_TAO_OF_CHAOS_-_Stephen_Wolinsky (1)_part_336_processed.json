  "title": "\"The Trance of the Observer: Dismantling for Objective Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of the observer and its limitations in achieving objective consciousness were explored. The text delved into the dualistic nature of the observer and observer-observed dyad and how it inhibits one from entering the state of observation with no object. It was highlighted that dismantling the observer trance is essential to accessing objective consciousness. In the final 200 tokens, the attention and observation characteristics will be discussed, with insights from Sufi Master Idries Shah's teachings.",
  "content": "As mentioned in Quantum Consciousness: Volume I, there are an infinite number of observers each with different created observations. Both psychological and spiritual systems have been developed to access this observer quality as a step in consciousness. However, to go beyond the personality and make Essence a station, we must dismantle the observer as a fixation, a contraction, or a condensation of undifferentiated consciousness. Stated another way, when undifferentiated consciousness condenses, it becomes self-consciousness and the subject/object observer, which is a \"higher function\" of personality arises, but is still in duality and hence is personality. As a note, the final state of Raja Yoga, translated as The King of Yogas, Yoga being defined as Union, is Samadhi. Samadhi means no meâ€”hence no observer/observed, just pure awareness with no object. To do this we will explore the observer as a trance that fixates and becomes what it observes. Next we will dismantle, the observer trance so that observation with no object or objective consciousness which is our nature can naturally emerge. Characteristics of Attention and Observation Let us begin by looking at how attention works. Noted Sufi Master Idries Shah states: \"It is most important that individuals realize: 1.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to move beyond the limitations of personality and access pure awareness, we must dismantle the observer trance and observe without fixation on objects. Understanding the characteristics of attention and observation is essential in this process, as they play a crucial role in our transactions and can be motivated by the need for attention. By recognizing our observer quality and transcending it, we can reach the final state of Raja Yoga, Samadhi, where there is no observer, just pure awareness."
