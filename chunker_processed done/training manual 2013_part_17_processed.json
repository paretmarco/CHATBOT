  "title": "\"The relationship between light spectrum and quantum consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article addresses the similarities between solar and arc-light and how their therapeutic attributes can be the same, backed by clinical and spectroscopic observations. It also explains the science behind the spectrum of visible and invisible light energy. The last 200 tokens explore the impact of light on the mind and how quantum physics can explain the emergence of consciousness. The article draws on quantum models of the mind and the theory of collective phenomena, which cannot be reduced to individual components of the system.",
  "content": "According to Heisenberg, when a quantum particle is not observed it exists as an ensemble of ``possibilities'' (in physics called a virtual state) in which it has a likelihood of existing simultaneously at all points of space; however, when an observation is performed the quantum particle makes a discontinuous jump (called a quantum transition) to a state with some definite position and is said to be in a condition of “actuality” (in physics called a physical state). The transition from the possible to the actual takes place the moment the quantum particle comes into contact with a measuring device. This \"superposition\" arrives into to the brain, enters the brain http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/views/QuantumStatesRetina.html. Quantum models of the mind associate consciousness with coherent superposition of states in the brain. Different works on the brain and mind problems have used quantum theory to explain the emergence of consciousness. There are, in quantum theory as well as in statistical physics, collective phenomena irreducible to individual components of the system.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concepts of superposition and quantum transition have shed light on our understanding of the emergence of consciousness. The idea that our brains can exist in multiple possible states simultaneously until an observation occurs is fascinating and may hold the key to explaining consciousness. As we continue to explore the possibilities of quantum theory, we may come closer to unraveling one of the greatest mysteries of the human mind."
