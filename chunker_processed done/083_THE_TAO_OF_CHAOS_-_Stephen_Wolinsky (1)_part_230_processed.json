  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explained how trauma can lead people to feel an internal vacuum, an \"inability to do,\" which they try to fill by constantly \"going for it,\" leading to obsessive thoughts or overachieving. In this concluding part, the author explores how this strategy can result in a reaction formation and an attempt to dominate others, which can further deceive oneself and others. The author also explains how people who feel this vacuum are not truly in their bodies, resulting in incomplete orgasms. The text discusses the importance of recognizing this tendency and finding a way to heal from the trauma. The relevant concepts explored in this text include the loss of Essence, observer/personality dyad, and reaction formation.",
  "content": "This internal vacuum yields someone -Who is constantly on the \"go\" to fill the vacuum, or perceived void, and over-compensates for an inability to do, act, or create; simply put, this type \"goes for it.\" For example, this observer/ personality dyad might have obsessive thoughts, or try to constantly achieve to fill the perceived vacuum. The interesting 186 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS part of this strategy of fixating attention is that there is a reaction formation and an attempt to dominate others in order to defend against people seeing the inner emptiness, which they define as a lack and a feeling of not doing, i.e., the best offense is a good defense. This reaction formation leads itself to deceiving self and others through domination. Moreover, the defense of their vacuum is so powerful that a true #3 does not even know what they are feeling. Why? Because their center is outside of themselves. They feel good if others are giving their vanity attention and telling them they look or are good. They feel bad if others are disinterested or critical.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, constantly seeking the validation and attention of others to fill an internal vacuum can lead to an overcompensation of actions and domination tactics. Recognizing this fixation strategy and addressing the underlying issues of emptiness and trauma can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling mindset. Remember that positive attention is preferred, but negative attention is still seen as better than no attention at all."
