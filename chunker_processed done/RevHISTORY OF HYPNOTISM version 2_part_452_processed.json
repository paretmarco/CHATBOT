  "title": "\"What Were the Views of Esdaile on Mesmerism and Its Potential Benefits for Mental Health?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text chronicles the experiences of Dr. Esdaile with Mesmerism, highlighting its effectiveness in curing mental illnesses. He supports this with examples of successful treatments he administered and the use of Mesmerism to maintain discipline in a lunatic asylum. In the last 200 tokens, Esdaile's broadness of view is discussed, with his extensive reading of other literature on the subject, which sets his opinions apart from narrow-minded hypnotists. His contemporary, Dr. Kean, is also mentioned for his use of Mesmerism in the asylum.",
  "content": "If this is not enough to give the coup de grace to the theory of suggestion and imagination as explanatory of the results obtained in my practise of Mesmerism, I will adduce instances of people being entranced from another room without their having the least suspicion of my intentions, and of a blind man being reduced on the first attempt to the most intense degree of mesmeric coma.‚Äù157 Esdaile's broadness of view What probably saved Esdaile from growing narrow, and perhaps becoming hardened into the head of a School, was that as soon as he had satisfied himself that Mesmerism was a great reality he sent for all the books he could hear of that treated of the subject, most of which at that time were written in French or German; and it is the fact that he was well informed as to what others had done that gives a weight to his opinions that is wanting in the case of those who ignore or deny any experiences but those which agree with their own - the besetting sin of the modern Hypnotist.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile's thoroughness and eagerness to learn about Mesmerism helped him to avoid narrow-mindedness and to appreciate the work of those who came before him. He recognized the importance of being well-informed and incorporating different perspectives, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding and wider acceptance of the practice. The modern hypnotist could learn a valuable lesson from Esdaile's broadness of view."
