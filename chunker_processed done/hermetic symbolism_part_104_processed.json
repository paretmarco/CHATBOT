  "title": "Understanding the Four Elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author delves deeper into the four elements that constitute all material things. Agrippa's theory states that these elements, Fire, Earth, Water, and Air, are not in their pure state but rather mixed and constantly changing. The elements are distinguished by their elemental qualities of dryness, wetness, cold, and heat. The author asserts that we must learn to feel these elements within our body, as they correspond to different parts of corporeal life. Earth is associated with the physical body, Air with the breath of life, Water with bodily fluids, and Fire with the life force energy. The four elements also have symbols and colors associated with them, belonging to different zodiac signs and representing different seasons.",
  "content": "In the warm, wet Air, soars the Eagle of St John, which is also the bird of Jupiter. Jupiter can be seen amidst the autumn constellations in the firmament. Blue, the colour of the atmosphere, is attributed to this Element. Water, which is cold and wet, flows from the urn of Aquarius, the water-carrier and the sign of winter, which in Christianity is replaced by the Angel of St. Matthew. Green is the colour of Water, and also the colour of Venus. Fire, which burns with the ardour of Mars, is hot and dry. It can be seen emerging from the red mane of the Lion of St Marc, which is the Zodiac sign for midsummer. The four elements are reunited in the psyche of man and correspond to different parts of corporeal life: Earth corresponds to the physical body, Air represents the breath of life that maintains the body by way of the bodily fluids that transport it, which are represented by Water. And Fire represents the life force energy, the source of all heat and energy.",
  "last_phrase": "Understanding the interplay between the four elements and how they correspond to different aspects of our being can help us establish a healthy circle of life force. By allowing Air and Water to penetrate to the core of our being, we can fuel our internal Fire and maintain a balanced physical and spiritual existence."
