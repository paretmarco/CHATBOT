  "title": "\"Curing Insanity with Mesmerism: Results and Experiences\"",
  "first_phrase": "In a report of Mesmerism's success in curing patients, we see that even those who were insane could be affected by this treatment, according to Dr. Esdaile. During his six months of treatment, out of 37 patients, only one died, and the rest showed improvement. Interestingly, Dr. Kean from Moorshedabad Insane Asylum had even better results, with 64 out of 74 patients being discharged cured using Mesmerism. The report suggests Dr. Kean used Suggestion technique to achieve these results.",
  "content": "In the Lunatic Asylum of Berampore Dr. Kean treated seventy-four patients by Mesmerism during the years 1847 and 1848, and discharged sixty-four cured. It is probable that Dr. Kean also used what would now be called Suggestion, for the \"Calcutta Register of Medical Science,\" in reporting these cases, remarks that the promise to do anything when mesmerised is carried out afterwards in the waking state, the subject feeling \"an instinctive craving\" to do it, not knowing why. Esdaile says of him:-- \"Dr. Kean, of Berhampore, has for several years used Mesmerism very extensively in his large Lunatic Asylum with excellent curative effects, and finds it of great service in maintaining the quiet and discipline of his hospital.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Kean's successful use of Mesmerism in treating mental illness in the 1840s provides evidence of its potential as a valuable tool in the field of medicine. Moreover, Esdaile's broad perspective on Mesmerism and his willingness to learn from other sources serves as an important reminder that open-mindedness is a vital quality that all medical professionals should possess."
