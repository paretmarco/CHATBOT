  "title": "What Was Esdaile's Belief in Animal Magnetism and Who Were His Sources of Influence?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses James Esdaile's views on animal magnetism. Esdaile was a surgeon who believed in the existence of a \"vital agent\" that he used to induce anesthesia in his patients during surgical procedures. The author emphasizes that Esdaile did not rely on the authority of others for his beliefs, but instead based them on his own experiences. The author also notes that Esdaile did not investigate the psychic or cosmic aspects of animal magnetism, but rather focused on the physical effects. The author argues against those who discredit the experiences of highly respected individuals who investigated animal magnetism and emphasizes the importance of investigating the phenomena of nature.",
  "content": "But it has been alleged that the evidence of these enlightened individuals is liable to discredit because, forsooth, they were engaged in investigating the phenomena of Animal Magnetism. Assuredly, this is a strange, and, we must take the liberty of saying, most preposterous objection. Pray, how are the facts of Nature to be discovered and appreciated unless by those who take an interest in investigating them?\" Esdaileâ€™s belief in the \"vital agent\" Esdaile, however, was too thoroughly grounded in his own experiences at first ever to rest his opinions on the authority of others, and what he gives us are his own experiences, and his own deductions from them. His experiences forced him to adopt the fluid theory as the only possible explanation of the effects produced by his method; but he did not investigate the psychic, and what might perhaps be called the cosmic aspects of Animal Magnetism. He did not deny the power of mind, or the purely psychic method, to cure disease; but, as he did not employ it, he does not theorise about it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is clear that Esdaile's experiences and deductions from them were crucial in advancing our understanding of Mesmerism. Despite criticisms, his work paved the way for modern hypnotists and laid the foundation for the study of the power of the mind in healing. As Esdaile once said, \"healthy senses, a plain, direct understanding, careful observation, long experience, and every precaution against deception\" are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of the phenomena of Animal Magnetism."
