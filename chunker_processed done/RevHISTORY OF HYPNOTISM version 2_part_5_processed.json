  "content": "The so-called ‘Energetic’ elements along with a number of other physiological ones, refer to what continues to be called magnetism, which is the most simple and the most diffused way of healing in the world. It starts from Nature. “Magnetism is the art of aiding nature in re-establishing equilibrium in the body” Mesmer Nowadays our modern culture has led us to a very artificial world making it difficult to understand what is written in many ancient books. “The healing power of Magnetism appears to have been known to the ancients, and to have become lost by the effect of revolutions ; these processes, simple as nature, from which they are derived, constitute Magnetism.” Adolphe Didier First, we must enter into the frame of mind that what we call magnetism is natural, pleasant and soothing. It is one of the most beneficial practices we can find. Using the hands and the gaze for healing is attested in every culture. It is something that pertains not only to the human world, but also to the animal world. By using the very same salutary techniques that we describe here it is also possible to heal animals.",
