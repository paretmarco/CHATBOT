  "title": "\"Enneagram Therapy: Reabsorbing I-dentities to Reach Your Real Self\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed the therapy's importance in entering through the hole, which acts as a gateway into Essence and your Real Self. It emphasized the significance of the Enneagram, an ancient system describing nine basic personality types that serve as a map of I-dentities. This text dives deeper into the Enneagram as it defends against the inner emptiness and how it moves like a pendulum between appearance and disappearance. It integrates the Enneagram with traditional psychotherapeutic diagnosis to explore the goal of each I-dentity and reabsorb them back within our emptiness.",
  "content": "The enneagram shows us types, but the personality types of the enneagram are organized to defend against the perceived gnawing emptiness, which is your Essence or real self. What this means is that although the personality types of the enneagram demonstrate movements of a type and style with I-dentities, the enneagram is a description of personality that is created to defend against the inner emptiness, which is the Essence or your Real Self Enneagram personality types with perceived correlating I-dentities defend against going into the perceived emptiness. The enneagram shows us our chief strategy (feature) trance to defend against the emptiness; furthermore, it moves like a pendulum fighting its own appearance and disappearance. We will integrate the enneagram with the more traditional psychotherapeutic diagnosis of Character Analysis from Wilhelm Reich, M.D. In doing so, we will go through the major I-dentity structures that defend against the inner emptiness, which is perceived as chaos and leads us to our Essential or Real Self Finally, from the emptiness will we explore the goal of each I-dentity, and reabsorb the I-dentity back within our emptiness by accessing the qualities that the Identity is seeking outwardly through the use of I-dentities, by extracting the inner essential qualities that are within us.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the enneagram and character analysis can help us identify our strategies for defending against our inner emptiness, but ultimately, the goal is to reabsorb our personalities back into our essence and experience essential qualities without I-dentities. Integrating these concepts into therapy can lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, and various systems of psychotherapy and spirituality offer different approaches to diagnosis."
