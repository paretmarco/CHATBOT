  "first_phrase": "The previous 300 tokens explain the differences between Mesmer and Experimental Magnetism, the importance of mutual effort in the magnetic state and how to successfully magnetize a subject. This final 200 tokens explores why old magnetizers avoided the hypnotic state and focused on studying the magnetic condition. They believed that any outer influence could hinder the development of individual faculties. Furthermore, the work of animal magnetism is a mutual effort, and both the operator and the subject enter into a specific state during the process. The interaction involves throwing off and directing the nervous or vital fluid, rendering the operator susceptible to new impressions.",
  "content": "â€œIn fact, when a man magnetizes, he puts himself, by the exertion of his will, in a state different from his habitual one, he concentrates his attention upon a single object, he throws off and directs beyond himself the nervous or vital fluid, and this new manner of being renders him susceptible of new impressions. He first perceives a change operated in him self by the action in which he- is engaged. He then experiences by the reaction of him whom he magnetizes, various sensations which affect him more or less according to the degree of susceptibility with which he is endowed, and according to the degree of attention which he pays to recognize and distinguish them. The change which occurs in us when we act magnetically, that is to say, when the passes we make are magnetic, and the feeling which persuades us we are in communication with him whom we wish to magnetize, are things which it is impossible to describe, but which they who are in the habit of magnetizing, and who have observed what passes in themselves, recognize with certainty.",
  "last_phrase": "To become a successful magnetist, one must understand the importance of concentration, directing the nervous or vital fluid, and being open to new impressions. While the process may seem indescribable, it requires a determined intention, a strong interest in the patient, and confidence in our ability to heal. However, preparing the client's environment can also play a crucial role in their recovery process. Allowing them to wait in a calm and safe waiting room can help them start the healing process before they even enter the therapist's office."
