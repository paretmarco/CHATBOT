  "title": "Understanding Mesmerismus: Energy, Belief, and Personal Magnetism",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the topic discussed was mesmerismus © and its connection with hypnosis, energy, beliefs, and reality creation. The concept of energy was highlighted as being crucial in understanding mesmerismus ©, and attention was given to the role of belief in achieving desired outcomes. The section also emphasized the limitations of materialistic approaches and the importance of the gaze in directing energy. The final part explores the idea of personal magnetism and its link to communication. It provides insights into how personal magnetism can be developed through the path followed in the school, emphasizing the importance of a communicative posture that is suited to the situation.",
  "content": "The first results might be obtained even without believing in any thing, but it is indisputable that having a positive belief does ultimately generate the hoped for result. We should once again remember here that energy follows thought as its subordinate, and we therefore create our own reality. It might in such case be useful to be steeped in a reality where it is possible to achieve results which would otherwise not be attainable. In order to make ourselves even clearer, we would like to point out that a materialistic discipline will never be able to accomplish certain results which are achievable through magnetism, as any such discipline already sets limits on its scope by defining itself as materialistic, and thereby negating other possibilities which are not empirically measurable. Why it the gaze so important? Energy go where attention goes, and attention goes where eyes go How can one define a person as being “magnetic”? The path developed in our school is very useful for developing personal magnetism and charisma. Contrary to the prevailing idea, magnetism has no need to impose any thing. In actual fact, it obtains things naturally. A magnetic person adopts a communicative position which suits the relevant situation. He neither guides nor follows.",
  "last_phrase": "To harness the power of magnetism and achieve results beyond the scope of materialistic disciplines, it is essential to understand that energy follows thought, and attention follows the gaze. By developing personal magnetism and charisma, one can adopt a communicative position that suits the situation, neither guiding nor following, but deciding what to do. Mesmeric tools such as the bacquet may be used but are not necessary. Remember, a magnetic person obtains things naturally without the need to impose anything."
