  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the importance of accepting and understanding oneself instead of judging. This leads to enriching life and consciousness by releasing the energies from the profound part of ourselves. The ultimate goal is to remove obstacles and grasp the nature of life and mind for freedom. The last part consists of five exercises to achieve presence and self-awareness. These exercises include imagining a focal point, projecting it onto the mirror image, gazing at oneself in the mirror, and maintaining constant awareness of one part of the body. These practices encourage self-consciousness and present-moment awareness, aiding in the journey towards self-discovery.",
  "content": "It denotes the direction taken by attention. In order to obtain optimal results, you will need to be able to steer your attention. Exercise 3: Projection of the point. Straight after the previous exercise, you should look at yourself in a mirror and imagine that you are projecting the focal point of your attention onto the image in the mirror, in the area lying between the eyes. You should then simply say, “I am now going to embark on the path to my own self”. Close your eyes, move away from the mirror, and do not mull over that any longer until the next day comes. Exercise 4: Presence by the mirror. You should simply gaze at yourself in the mirror without blinking your eyes. Fix your gaze on the space between your eyes. By doing this exercise, you will notice a number of different sensations, and in some moments you will attain self-consciousness. Exercise 5: Constant awareness of one part of the body. Presence means: to be in the present.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing these exercises, you can improve your ability to steer your attention in the right direction and achieve a state of constant awareness. Remember to keep focusing on one part of your body, project the focal point of your attention onto the mirror, and take the first step towards your self-improvement by embarking on this path of self-discovery. With consistent effort, you'll start \"remembering your own self\" and achieve your optimal results."
