  "title": "Understanding the State of Hypnotism: From Light Sleeping to Somnambulism",
  "first_phrase": "This 200-token piece concludes a discourse on hypnotism, where the editor shares the profound state of deep hypnotism where patients lose touch of their sensory impressions and movements. In some cases, the hypnotism borders on coma while in others, it could be as light as a disturbed dream. The patient's actions are purely imitative without any idea or connection to their actions. However, in mild cases, patients can vividly recollect their actions when they awake. The editor highlights different degrees of sleeping, dreams, and the somnambulist's state.",
  "content": "Here the patient may be partially conscious of the requests made to him, and of the imitative movements executed before his eyes; to some extent he may resist the commands of the operator, he may feel he is being fooled, and yet he may perform many ridiculous actions; and when he awakes he may have a vivid recollection of the events in which he participated. A hypnotised person, in fact, is in a state similar to that of the somnambulist, who acts the movements of a disturbed dream. There are many degrees of the sleeping state from the profound condition resembling coma to that of the light sleeper who starts with every sound. In some sleeps there are dreams in which the sleeper is so occupied with the phantoms of thought as to pay no attention to external impressions, unless these be sufficiently powerful to awake him, whilst there are other sleeps in which the boundary between the conscious reception of new impressions and the reproduction of old ones is so thin as to permit of a blending of the two.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnotism is a complex state of consciousness that varies from person to person. It is similar to the condition of a somnambulist, and those who are hypnotized may perform actions that they do not remember upon awakening. However, with varying degrees of the semiconscious state, the depth of the hypnotic state can determine the capacity for responding to external impressions. Understanding the complexities of hypnotism can assist in managing the condition and using it to benefit the individual."
