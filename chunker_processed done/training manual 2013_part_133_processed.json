  "title": "\"The Significance of Pingala and Ida Nadis\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the concept of the Nadis - Ida and Pingala, and their role in yogic practices. The Nadis are believed to have an extrasensory function, influencing empathic and instinctual responses. By performing Pranayama or alternate breathing through left and right nostrils, one can stimulate the Nadis, which are linked to the right and left sides of the brain. The Nadis are said to correspond to the two serpents on the Caduceus of Hermes and the Kundalini energy that is to be set in motion along those channels. The upcoming section delves deeper into the spiritual significance of Kundalini energy and the role of the Nadis in its activation.",
  "content": "As regards the three main Nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna) they are related to the following Caduceus of Hermes:\"In the East, the symbol of the two serpents twisting on the rod corresponds to the two currents Pingala and Ida which coil around the Merudanda: the first is red, hot and dry, likened to the Sun and the Alchemic Sulphur. The second, Ida, is cold and wet, like the Alchemic Mercury, and it is correlated with the Moon for its silver pallor.\" If we come back to our comparison with the caduceus, \"the two snakes symbolizing the kundalini (or serpent-fire) which is presently to be set in motion along those channels, whereas the wings represent the power of conscious flight through higher planes which the deriving fire confers\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the three nadis and their correlation with alchemical sulphur and mercury, as well as the symbolism of the caduceus, illustrate the balance and integration of masculine and feminine principles in various traditions. Understanding these principles can aid in personal growth and development, as well as be used in the field of psychology, specifically in Jungian psychology."
