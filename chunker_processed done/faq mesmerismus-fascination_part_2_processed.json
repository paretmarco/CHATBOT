  "content": "-How long do you normally take to perform an induction? Few seconds . You have to remember this is a practical field and unlike verbal hypnosis it requires attention to detail. It depends on the client. -What is instant fascination? How does it work? This technique has the ability to immediately eradicate physical pains, muscular tensions, headaches, tinnitus, and a whole assortment of additional ailments. Here it goes a short history of its discovery. We owe this methodology to Erminio from Pisa, who was accustomed to call it “Instant Hypnosis”. He was the only practitioner throughout Italy. Once, he gave us an astounding demonstration of it in the presence of three hundred people in Milan. He did so by working on each of those persons in attendance for some twenty seconds, thereby producing results which in most cases endured through the following days, while in other instances they actually proved conclusive in their effect. In certain cases, a single intervention is enough to engender a permanent result. In other instances, it is necessary to apply the technique twice or thrice in a row, whereupon a more than highly satisfactory overall percentage of 98% of healed people will be actualized.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, instant fascination is a powerful technique that can provide immediate relief from various ailments. With proper attention to detail and a focused approach, practitioners can help clients overcome physical pains and mental barriers. Although the technique's effectiveness may vary based on individual situations, it has a high success rate and can deliver conclusive results with just one or a few interventions."
