  "title": "\"The Relevance of Phrenology in Phreno-Mesmerism Experiments\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the importance of understanding Phrenology in Phreno-Mesmerism. In the last 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the necessary knowledge of Mesmerism and Phrenology that a successful experimentalist must possess. The text highlights that some individuals are more susceptible to mesmeric influence than others, and those with a mental and mental-vital temperament are more sprightly and responsive to the influence. The author emphasizes the importance of having a thorough understanding of Mesmerism and Phrenology, as lack of knowledge can lead to failures in experiments.",
  "content": "In the majority of cases the sensitives, as one of the general public, can have no possible knowledge of Phrenology. It is not possible for the experimentalist to be successful in this particular department without a thorough knowledge of Mesmerism on the one hand and Phrenology on the other. The frequent failures which are sure to accompany a “little knowledge” have led many experiments to declare that phreno-mesmeric phenomena are either exceedingly fugitive in character, or where determined, are due to coincidence, accident, imagination, etc. I shall neither explain nor defend Phrenology here, but content myself with pointing out (that predicated on temperament) some persons are more susceptible to mesmeric influence than others. Of these, even in the sleep (and based on the same physiological conditions of organisation), some are more dull, or less susceptible than others. Persons of the mental and mental-vital temperament are more sprightly and vivacious, respond more readily to influence, than those of more stolid and less impressive natures. The former will respond to the lightest touch. In some cases, contact is not even necessary. The latter require decided and continuous pressure before the cerebral more stolid and less impressive natures. The former organs respond.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while phreno-mesmeric phenomena may be difficult to understand and achieve, certain individuals with a specific temperament are more susceptible to mesmeric influence than others. These individuals, when fully under the influence, make excellent subjects for various psychological experiments. Although some may doubt the possibility of these operations, the experiments of Charcot based on automatic inhibition provide probable evidence of their existence."
