  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we delve into the importance of presence, a concept that is the quintessence of everything according to our author. The focus is on a highly respected French individual who has extensive knowledge and experience in esotericism, literature, and quantum sciences. He believes that presence is a simple yet technical aspect that people often overlook. He has listed various traditions that speak of presence, and how it holds the key to solving most problems, including healing. The ultimate goal is to restore man to his own self by returning to the state of presence.",
  "content": "He boasts hundreds of filiations, and is highly respected in France. His extensive experience has availed him a capacity to find his way, amid a number of often peripheral traditions, to the comprehension of what is ultimately the quintessence of every thing: Presence. This is, to many people, a novel concept. The truth, however, is that one comes across numerous traditions which speak of it. Gurdjeffâ€™s work mentions presence, Yoga has presence as its goal, and the same holds true of Taoist alchemy. If the most spectacular instances of healing were to be analysed, we would notice that the key lies there, i.e. in restoring man to his own self. The cause of most sicknesses and problems is in fact the circumstance that average man is distant from himself, caught as he is in a life guided by material and contingent values which can often generate both internal and external conflicts. The main key to solve them is a full return to presence, where problems cease to exist.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of presence may be unfamiliar to some, but it is a crucial aspect in many traditions and has been proven effective in healing and problem-solving. Jean Pierre de Giudicelli's extensive experience and knowledge, along with the guidance of Pastor, has led to the development of a method that includes breathing exercises as a key component. By returning to a state of presence, we can overcome conflicts and operate at a higher and reinvigorated level."
