  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the Fixation of Attention Strategy #4, the Masochist, in psychology's character analysis. This segment delves into the strategy's fixation on melancholy, which creates a confusion between pain and love. The observer/personality dyad is envious of self and others who possess the love and roots they feel they have lost, ultimately leading them to seek their \"roots.\" The segment also notes that #4 can create an internal ideal image of Essence and mistake that as Essence. This fixation is illustrated using Illustration #10.",
  "content": "This fixation is envious of others who, in their opinion, have the love and roots they feel they lost as they moved from Essence to personality. This fixation of attention on melancholy also has a feeling of being broken hearted. As the pendulum swings the other way, this fixation strategy of the observer/personality dyad can take the stance of self-rejection and no self-worth. Often times the observer/personality dyad creates a substitute idealized being, guru, teacher, or lover that is an image of Essence externally, but not actually Essence. For this reason, #4 often sees themselves as not connected to their own life or their roots, and they are seeking their \"roots.\" Here the observer personality labels the emptiness of essence as having no real connection to people and life and, hence, feels melancholy. In many ways the #4 strategy of fixated attention can also create an internal ideal image of Essence and mistakes that as Essence. See Illustration #10.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the difference between an idealized image of Essence and actual Essence is crucial to avoid fixating on external substitutes for self-worth and connection. Learning to embrace one's own life and roots is a vital step towards overcoming the emptiness and melancholy that often accompany this fixation strategy. Remember, the symbol or image of an internal deity is not Essence and should not be mistaken for it."
