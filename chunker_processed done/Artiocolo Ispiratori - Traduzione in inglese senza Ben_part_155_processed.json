  "first_phrase": "The previous text explains the importance of calmness and emotional control in reducing exercise while emphasizing control over mental chatter. It further discusses Prof. Di Pisa's dedication to practicing his gaze despite his extensive training. The text then delves into the concept of presence shared by some of the most revered healers in Western history, like Mesmer, Kremmerz, and Cagliostro, who were bound by an ancient Egyptian alchemical tradition that aims to nurture inward development. The tradition highlights a proactive understanding of \"presence to the action,\" making it the endpoint in both Western and Eastern healing traditions. This section emphasizes that this tradition has spanned centuries, with the same concepts and stages written in classic works over a thousand years ago.",
  "content": "It carries in its central nucleus an attentive emphasis on the concept of presence. This concept of presence is understood in an active sense. It is, in other words, “presence to the action”, that is, a kind of reintegration of one’s abilities, which ought to take place at each and every moment of one’s day rather than as a mere perception whilst in a static state. It takes the shape of the endpoint both in the Eastern and the Western traditions. Various organizations, such as the Rosicrucians, have acted as vectors to convey such traditional approach centred around focusing one’s work on presence. The tradition is nevertheless still unified and clearly discernible in the background. The tradition has in itself remained unchanged and unchangeable over the centuries. One can thus read classic works written more than a thousand years before this age and find therein reference to the same concepts and intermediate stages.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of presence to the action, as emphasized by traditional approaches in both Eastern and Western cultures, remains relevant today. Various organizations, such as the Rosicrucians and the Egyptian Rite, have preserved and conveyed this tradition over the centuries, which includes not only alchemical practices for personal improvement but also therapeutic dimensions. By integrating this concept of presence into our daily lives, we can achieve a sense of reintegration of our abilities and promote personal growth."
