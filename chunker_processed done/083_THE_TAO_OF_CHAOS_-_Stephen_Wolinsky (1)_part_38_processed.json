  "title": "\"The Organizing of Chaos: How Our Habits Limit Our Experience\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the first part of this text, the author explores how we generally organize and order our feelings and energy in the same way, leading to rigid patterns of behavior. As an example, a man in Dr. Ginsburg's workshop had eczema as a child, and his body had learned to find a position that, while still uncomfortable, became his reference point for comfort. This final part of the text explains further how this pattern of behavior can be limiting and result in the rejection of new energy that might disrupt the psychological system. The author references Fourth Way teacher G.I. Gurdjieff, who believed that people have a limited number of physical and psychological positions that make it challenging to experience new things subjectively.",
  "content": "Chaos therefore is often perceived as anything which disrupts a psychological system. In the above mentioned case; even if it is uncomfortable, he would use this discomfort as his new standard for comfort. In another way, if I see myself as unattractive and someone says \"I'm attracted to you,\" the energy disrupts my system and I begin to feel nervous and fearful and maybe will even avoid seeing a person or having further contact. The 22 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS energy that comes in from the statement from the person saying, \"I'm attracted to you,\" feels chaotic to the individual who has a frozen internal image of themselves as being unattractive. If the outcome is painful enough, you'll see a therapist or family counselor. Noted Fourth Way teacher G.I. Gurdjieff often said that people have a limited number of positions both physical and psychological. This means that there is a rigidity in the system that doesn't allow many experiences to be experienced subjectively. For example, few people would deny that anger or fear are not allowed or are resisted inside their bodies.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing and embracing chaos as a part of our psychological and emotional system can help us break free from rigidity and limitations. By acknowledging and releasing resistance to experiences, we can open ourselves up to new possibilities and expand our individual experiences in all aspects of life. Seeking therapy or counseling can be a helpful tool in this process, and bioenergetic therapy can be particularly effective in addressing chronic interruptions in the flow of energy and emotions."
