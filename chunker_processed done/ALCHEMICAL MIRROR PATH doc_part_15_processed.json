  "title": "\"Exploring the Strange and Lucid Experience of Dual Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text offers a glimpse into the world of experimental perception, where individuals can reach a state of detachment from their physical body and experience a new mode of being. The last 200 tokens explore the strange and fascinating phenomena that can occur during these experiments, including the ability to control perception of space and even contemplate one's own body as a separate entity. The text warns against dangerous methods of achieving these states, and emphasizes the importance of directing the force of impression for one's purpose. The concepts of vertigo, detachment, and personal transformation are central to this exploration of experimental perception.",
  "content": "(Note : in some experiments it is better to sit down while looking at the mirror, in case you loose totally consciousness) Vertigo - which often results in panic in a weak-willed person, and this panic can be an obstacle for further refinement, easily can instead in an evolved person be changed in a strange and almost funny curiosity when the consciousness, detached from the body, almost suspended in mid-air of the room, has the perception safe and controllable of the new situation in which he is, knows that sees, even feeling it has no eyes, and see a space surrounding that, wonder of wonders, can increase or diminish by will. There is no more a fixed idea of space. The operator can also contemplate the body, lying inert, and say: - I am the one here, but I'm not, I am an I am not at the same time, or I'm not at all?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while vertigo can be unsettling and scary for some, it can also lead to a heightened state of consciousness and a new perspective on the self and the world around us. Exploring these altered states can be a valuable tool for personal growth and understanding, albeit difficult to articulate or comprehend fully with language alone."
