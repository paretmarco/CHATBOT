  "title": "\"Exploring Non-Dual Space through Mandelbaum Effect and Dark Focus\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the phenomenon of fascination and how it involves observing different elements through techniques such as divergent and convergent gaze, physical effort, and peripheral hand stimulations. In this final part, we enter the space of \"nothing\" and explore the Mandelbaum effect, a physiological process related to accommodation that causes the eye to approach \"resting\" accommodation. This effect is essential to understanding why the use of the hand is a vital component of fascination. We delve into the scientific codification of the Mandelbaum effect and its origins and connect it with the tradition of \"sky gazing\" found in disciplines like dzogchen, where practitioners can experience non-duality by focusing on the space of nothing.",
  "content": "The Mandelbaum effect refers to an inadvertent accommodation response to an intervening surface (e.g. the hand) while attempting to focus a distant object of interest (the operator). It was first scientifically codified by Mandelbaum in 1960 in relation to something observed during pilots flights. The use of the hand in fascination can be explained with factors related to the Mandelbaum effect, i.e. the tendency of the eye to approach \"resting\"accommodation‚Äù. The resting point of accommodation is also called the \"dark focus\" as it is the distance where the eyes accommodate as they look in the dark. We note that there are disciplines, as the \"dzogchen\", that teach \"sky gazing\". Sky gazing will result in the eyes accommodating to the space of nothing and in this space we can experience non duality. Also when visibility is poor, the eye tends to relax and focus on its best distance, technically known as \"empty field\" or \"dark focus\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Mandelbaum effect can help us better comprehend how our eyes perceive distance and focus. By practicing techniques such as \"sky gazing,\" we can experience non-duality and relax the eyes. Remember, the effect is not a refractive error but a response to an intervening surface while attempting to focus on a distant object."
