  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the \"I\" and whether it is just an illusion or if it is a being with objective entity. The author references Socrates' famous quote \"I know that I know nothing\" to emphasize the point that the \"I\" is nothing by itself and just a product of our memory, imagination, aspirations, desires, and ancestral heritage. In the last 200 tokens, the text touches on the idea that although there may not be a special divine spark that secures the persistence of our \"I,\" life itself is indestructible and transforms in appearance and modes of expression. The author refers to hypnotized people to illustrate how multiple states of consciousness can coexist in the same individual.",
  "content": "The I thus becomes the center of the being, and this I is made of our impressions of our memory of all images retained by our imagination or combined by her, by our aspirations, by our desires, by the resolutions we have taken , by our ancestral heritage, etc. . In addition , our being changes continously in consequence of the influences that it suffers and therefore, our I that in abstract should remains fixed manifests itself differently depending on the circumstances . When we change our normal state , as in anger, if we are drunk or insanity , our I seems to have changed Nothing forces us to believe that exist in us as a special divine spark, that can secure the persistence of our I beyond the boundaries of the earth's existence . But man has always had the intuition that life is indestructible , that life transforms changing appearance and modes of expression, but it did not never extinguishes. Certainly, nothing get lost , except in the intellectual and moral order or in the domain of the forces or matter . But , as has been seen in the hypnotized people , multiple states of consciousness could coexist in the same individual .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our being is constantly changing and our sense of self, the \"I\", is not a fixed entity but rather a combination of various impressions, aspirations, desires, and influences. While we may not possess a divine spark that guarantees our survival beyond earthly existence, the intuition that life is indestructible remains within us. As part of the great universal life, the individual is a temporary manifestation of the species that is part of a larger, more extensive life."
