  "title": "The Natural State, Group Connection and Magnetism.",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of the magnetic fluid and its relationship with magnetism. Before that, there is a reflection on the primal state that man had before civilization, which allowed for a deeper connection with nature and others. The text emphasizes the importance of group connection and empathy, as a fundamental aspect of understanding and employing magnetism. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into the power of sympathy between individuals as a core principle of magnetism, as described by philosopher Deleuze.",
  "content": "There is also an inner state of peace and well being. Man feels himself well and in contact with his true nature. It is what is called the \"green lion\" by the alchemist, a state of connection with Nature (hence the colour green) and strength (the lion). There is no \"ego\" and therefore some ancient alchemist depicted the \"green lion\" devouring the \"sun\" (that in this case was the symbol of the limited ego). Why go away from this natural state? Because of fear: fear brings us in disconnecting from reality, on concentration only on some aspect and loosing the real perception of the others SECOND RULE IN MAGNETISM: connect to the others. \"Feel\" them As Deleuze said: In order that one individual may act upon another, there must exist between them a moral and physical sympathy ; as there is between all the members of an animated body15.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, in order to attain a state of peace and well-being, one must connect with nature and others while overcoming fear that could lead to disconnection from reality. Through the establishment of physical and moral sympathy, individuals can achieve a communication of sentiments and effectively rule a group while reducing individualistic ego. The use of eggregores and symbols can also aid in realizing this interconnected state."
