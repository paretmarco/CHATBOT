  "title": "\"Understanding the Sensations and Currents of Magnetic Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the various sensations that a practitioner may feel while using \"mesmerism\" on a patient to determine the nature and location of their disease. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces the concept of \"currents,\" or vapor that emanates from the patient's body and guides the practitioner's hand to the affected area. The author advises the practitioner to abandon themselves to these currents to achieve the greatest results.",
  "content": "If you experience pain in an organ on the right or on the left of your body, you should first approach by little and little to render the sensation more strong, and then withdraw yourself gradually to the distance of two or three feet; for it may be that the affected organ of your patient may act at a little distance upon the organ in you which is opposite; that his spleen, for instance, may make its action be felt upon your liver; but by withdrawing yourself, you may be sure that the sensation will be transferred from the right, to the analogous organ on the left. 3. And here there is something more important which has been unhappily too much neglected in our day. You will perceive, as it were, a vapor which escapes from certain parts of the body of your patient and takes a certain direction. This vapor will act upon you as a slight force which will attract or repel your hand, and which will conduct it from one place to another, provided you abandon yourself entirely to its action. These are what are called the currents.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you experience pain in an organ, approaching gradually and withdrawing yourself from the patient can help transfer the sensation to the opposite organ. In addition, recognizing and following the currents can help you naturally magnetize and carry the vital action to the deficient organ, indicating the crisis and termination of a treatment."
