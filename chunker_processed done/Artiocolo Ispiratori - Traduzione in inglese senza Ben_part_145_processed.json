  "title": "\"Understanding Fear and the Therapy of Positive Fascination\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text examines how fear can be eliminated through a process called 'fear-erasing' training. The researchers use a colored square stimulus which triggers fear in patients, then show them the squares repeatedly without the accompanying electrical shock. By doing so, the fear dissipates over time. However, if the training is not conducted within a short period after experiencing the stimulus, patients still retain a trace of the fear. The text also explores the idea that the ego can be transcended, which is a more powerful tool that can lead to total rebalancing. Ultimately, the authors argue that negative fascination arises from innate fears and anxieties that humans have about the unknown.",
  "content": "According to the researchers, this fact is explainable on the basis that when the fear is recreated, the memory associated with it crystallizes once more, precisely at that very moment where the memory is fragile and can be removed. It is important to observe the fact that the transcending of the ego which activates the fascination is an even more powerful tool, as it not only frees and eliminates a symptom, but, in several cases, makes room for a total rebalancing. If we want to express it in simpler terms, we might define the therapy of the look as “the positive fascination which chases away the negative fascination derived from life experiences”. The origin of problems It is the fears and anxieties which are intrinsic to man that create the “negative fascination”. Man in fact possesses an ancestral fear of the unknown, which thing pushes him into creating thought mechanisms aimed at concealing and overcoming this fear. The fear, however, is still there in his underlying being.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy of the look can help overcome the negative fascination that stems from innate fears and anxieties that humans possess. By transcending the ego and activating positive fascination, individuals can eliminate symptoms and achieve overall rebalancing. It's essential to understand that the origin of problems lies in the underlying fears and anxieties, and becoming captivated by external concepts is a coping mechanism. Thus, the therapy of the look helps individuals break free from these mechanisms and overcome their fears."
