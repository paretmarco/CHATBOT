  "title": "Working with Mirrors: Exploring Levels of Consciousness",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, we delve into the Italian tradition of the use of mirrors as a tool for spiritual development. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, a prominent representative of this tradition of Egyptian origin, is introduced. The text also mentions Cagliostro, who used a jug of water to communicate through allegorical pictures. The use of mirrors, jugs or other tools is the fundamental basis for the work of the fascinators, who operate not just in the physical dimension, but also in an energetic dimension. The preceding text outlines the ancient Egyptian and Greek tradition of initiation through passages, including a symbolic death of the self, to attain a higher consciousness. The four stages of an interesting work with mirrors are detailed, from physical distortions to conscious awareness of two worlds at the same time.",
  "content": "In ancient Egypt and Greece, starting around the seventh century BCE, the person initiated of the \"mystery\" cults, were conducted through a serie of passages, one of which was a symbolic death. This symbolic death was the \"death of the self\". It opened the mind of the practitioner to a wider dimension. In working with the mirror this is accomplished by entering deep in the dream and after transcending our physical and astral/emotional state by opening up to an higher dimension where will be at a superior level, where we will see the physical stage and the imagining stage as something \"below\" us. OPUS 1 â€“ Climbing The four Stages Let's see now the different steps of an interesting work with mirrors that will make you more and more aware of different level of consciousness. First step is the physical. We will look at a mirror and we will have various distortions. Second step is called \"fluidic\". Our mind will begin to project in this space, and get glimpses of an higher level of reality Third step is \"etheric\". We will go beyond the dream. We will be conscious in two worlds at the same time.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing the steps of working with mirrors, you can gradually attain a higher level of consciousness and self-awareness. By gazing deeply into the mirror, you can learn to transcend your physical and astral self and enter higher dimensions of reality. With patience and dedication, you too can experience the transformative power of this ancient practice."
