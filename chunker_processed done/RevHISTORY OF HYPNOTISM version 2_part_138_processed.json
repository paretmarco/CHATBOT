  "title": "\"Puysegur's Mesmerism: Healing and Clairvoyance Through Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, we dive deeper into the experiences of Puysegur, an early practitioner of magnetism in the field of healing. His successful cures using magnetism led to an influx of patients seeking relief. To accommodate them, he magnetized an elm in Buzancy, where the patients formed a chain and connected their affected areas to the tree. Puysegur also emphasized the importance of the air in the magnetic process while working on animals and humans. He discovered that through magnetism, a stable state could be induced, leading to an enlargement of faculties and ultimately, healing.",
  "content": "Meanwhile de Puysegur chose from among his patients several subjects who, through contact with his hands or on the presentation of a metallic tractor, fell into the ordinary crisis, and this soon passed into a sleep in which all physical faculties appeared to be suspended, while the mental faculties were enlarged. Puysegur had in fact strong attention to Nature. He called his process vegeto-magnetic He brought the attention also on the importance of the air in helping the magnetic process. Intuitively affirmed that “the air is the fluid”76, in the same way as in the Indian practice of Yoga the air is ‘prana’, vital force. Editor’s note: the act of breathing is fundamental even for the operator. All magnetists do breathing exercises. In the morning do 3 or 4 deep breathings. Do the same before working with your client. If you practice magnetism you will increase your results. Healing through enlargement of faculties The whole collection of Puysegur’s writings embodies an immense accumulation of experiences with clairvoyant persons during illness in respect to their own maladies.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's vegeto-magnetic process, which involved the use of his hands and a metallic tractor, led to astounding successes in the treatment of patients with clairvoyant abilities during illness. He emphasized the importance of breathing exercises, particularly before working with clients. Through Puysegur's work, the remarkable prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients were explored, providing invaluable insights into their own maladies as well as those of others."
