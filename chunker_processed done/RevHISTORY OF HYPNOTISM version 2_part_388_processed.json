  "title": "\"What was the treatment for the patient's fits and what were the resulting effects?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, Dr. Elliotson describes the treatment given to a patient suffering from fits. The patient was gradually given increasing doses of nitrate of silver, which was later discontinued due to its inability to reduce the frequency of her fits. She was then given quarter-grain doses of cuprum ammoniatum, which caused nausea and sickness, resolved through creosote doses. Soon after beginning treatment, the fits disappeared and were replaced by somnambulism—now called somno-vigilium. Dr. Elliotson attributes this outcome to the introduction of a new agent for the cure, which he will describe in the last 200 tokens.",
  "content": "On the 16th, the report states, that there has been no nausea and no fit. On the 17th, however, the nausea returned, and the creosote was increased to two minimdoses, with the effect of checking the sickness, and she bore the copper well. On the 20th, the dose was increased to one grain and a quarter. On the 24th, there had been no fit, and there was no nausea. Soon after she began the copper, which had not produced any decided effects, another agent was called into action in the cure, and any alteration in the state of the case he (Dr. E.) considered was to be ascribed to this. Under this treatment, which he should shortly speak of more fully, the fits ceased altogether, and instead of the patient having convulsions as she used to have, she was now seized with fits of somnambulism, or, as it had been proposed to call the state, somno-vigilium—a much more appropriate term, and one which expressed the condition better, the patient being both asleep and awake, and walking not being necessary for its existence, that symptom being present in only one species of the affection.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the patient was successfully treated with a combination of copper and another agent, which led to the cessation of convulsive fits. However, the treatment resulted in a new condition characterized by somnambulism or somno-vigilium with symptoms of insensibility and loss of senses. Further research and treatment may be required to address this new development."
