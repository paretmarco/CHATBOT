  "title": "What is the reality of Mesmerism according to Esdaile and how can medical professionals experiment with it?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Esdaile criticizes the medical community's ignorance of Mesmerism and urges for a better understanding of the practice. In the following 200 tokens, he describes the symptoms of Mesmerism and compares them to other known medical conditions. He argues that doctors should attempt to understand the effects of Mesmerism on the body in their own patients if they wish to fully comprehend its potential benefits. Esdaile emphasizes the importance of proper education and experience to distinguish true Mesmerism from quack practices.",
  "content": "The involuntary quivering of the eyelids and the spasmodic closing of the eye in persons a minute before wide awake, and resisting perhaps; the extinction of one or more of the organs of sense, which we saw in full activity but a moment ago; the eye turned up so that only the white can be seen, or staring wide open, fixed, and insensible to light; sleep-walking, delirium, convulsions, catalepsy, in persons not subject to those affections till they were subjected to the mesmeric process - is not any one of these induced symptoms as clearly the effect of some constraining influence as the production of insensibility ? \" He says:- \"If medical men wish to see and understand the effects of Mesmerism on the body, the natural and rational mode of proceeding is to attempt to develop them in the persons of their own patients; and, if they will take a tithe of the trouble I have been at, I can promise them very general success.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the effects of mesmerism on the body continue to inspire curiosity and debate amongst medical professionals. However, the best way to understand its potential is to experiment with it personally, leaving aside preconceptions and theories. As noted by the great John Elliotson, mesmeric sleep strengthens the patient, relieves pain, and promotes healing - making it a potentially useful technique for a range of medical procedures."
