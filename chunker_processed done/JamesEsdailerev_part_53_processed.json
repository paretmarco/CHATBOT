  "first_phrase": "This text explores the role of mesmerism in healing through the enlargement of faculties. In the preceding text, de Puysegur's work with Mesmerism in alleviating suffering in illnesses was discussed. Now, the focus shifts to the investigation of the prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients in both their own and others' ailments. De Puysegur's observations of artificial somnambulism through Cloquet's account are also detailed. In conclusion, de Puysegur's aim was therapeutics, as he sought to cure diseases through mesmerism.",
  "content": "De Puysegur gives full details of the cases of both this and the simpler kinds of clairvoyance — in reference to the patients' own illnesses — that he had the opportunity of observing. De Puysegur “Artificial somnambulism” Cloquet, an eye-witness,16 has given us some valuable information on the subject. He says that the patient's eyes were closed, and there was no sense of hearing, unless it was awakened by the master's voice. Care was taken not to touch the patient during his crisis, nor even the chair on which he was seated, as this would produce suffering and convulsions, which could only be subdued by the master. To rouse them from the trance, the master touched the patient's eyes, or said, \"Go and embrace the tree.\" Then they arose, still asleep, went straight to the tree, and soon afterwards opened their eyes. As soon as they returned to a normal condition, the patients retained no recollection of what had occurred during the three or four hours' crisis. But it was the cure of diseases at which de Puysegur aimed: therapeutics was his object, as it had been that of Mesmer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, De Puysegur's exploration of artificial somnambulism has provided valuable information on the healing power of patients during their crisis. The observation of a somnambulist's ability to identify remedy for curing ailments has opened up new possibilities for therapeutics that can improve the lives of fellow-creatures."
