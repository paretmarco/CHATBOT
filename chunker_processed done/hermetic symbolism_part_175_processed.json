  "first_phrase": "This text explores the symbolism of Arcanum III from a hermetic point of view. The first part discusses the simplified representation of the substance as a symbol and its components of the empty circle, Alkaline Salt, and Gem Salt. The second part delves into the meaning of the cross, as a symbol of life and work, and how it interacts with other elements in alchemical symbols. The last 200 tokens further explain the subtle entity that has reached its highest level of evolution, purity, and active power. The text concludes by mentioning how Hermetists used this symbol to denote Antimony and shows a 17th-century wooden sculpture of the Virgin of the Sacristy at the Church of Saint Thomas of Aquinas in Paris.",
  "content": "Far from alluding to death, as one might imagine, this is the symbol of life. But it springs from the interaction of two opposites: the Agent, represented by the vertical line and the Patient, by the horizontal. Without work there is no life, without the active working on the passive, an intelligent force on inert matter. In the same way as the half moon, the cross is drawn both atop and below other elements of alchemical symbols. In the former case, it indicates a job well done, perfection permanently achieved. In the second, on the other hand, it represents an active life force that wants to be exercised, with latent virtues hardened like a seed in the hope that they will one day develop. The symbol can refer to nothing more than a subtle entity that has reached its highest level of evolution, purity and active power. Hermetists used this symbol to denote their Antimony, which designates the permanent Water, the heavenly water, with which they purify the philosophical gold and clean it of all impurities. The Virgin of the Sacristy at the Church of Saint Thomas of Aquinas, in Paris. 17th century wooden sculpture.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the cross is not just a symbol of death, but of life that springs from the interaction of opposites. It represents an active life force that wants to be exercised, with latent virtues that will one day develop. By searching for the original base of our personalities, we can recognize the highest spirituality, personified in the celestial virgin. Through understanding and intelligence, we can rise above the brutishness of the material world and become sovereigns of the spiritual realm."
