  "title": "\"The Deceitful Identity of Fixation #3: Understanding Vanity and Overcompensation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author explains the concept of the #3 fixation which manifests in individuals who feel like they are imposters and \"acting\" to compensate for their underlying inability to do. In the last 200 tokens, the author further elaborates on this fixation and how it reinforces a state of deceit which stems from the individual's vanity and a false sense of self-identity. The author identifies this fixation as a powerful chief feature which is always trying to cover up the feeling of inadequacy through overdoing, overcompensating and justifying their actions as honest. However, since their self-identity is based on the label of not being able to do anything, they always feel like they have done nothing, causing them to feel deceitful even when they are always doing.",
  "content": "With the underlying state of feeling that they can't do, act, or create, however, the fixation is always trying to cover it up and look good by overdoing. For this reason, since they label the emptiness as an inability to do, act or create; most actions are seen as \"acting,\" and hence the person feels like they have to be deceitful. This also has manifested in clients I have seen who feel like an imposter. They are \"acting\" to compensate for their underlying state of an inability to do. To restate, from the outside a person might see the #3 fixation as always doing, but, subjectively since #3 has labeled the emptiness of Essence as an inability to do even if they are always doing they feel like they have done nothing. We must remember that the first label (I-dentity), in this case labeling the emptiness of Essence as an inability to do, is the strongest. The second I-dentity of overdoing is the compensation and can never over-compensate. To restate, #3 feels deceitful about their accomplishments because they don't believe they do anything, and secondly, you can never feel o.k.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to understand that the fixation of always overdoing and feeling like an imposter is often a result of labeling the emptiness of Essence as an inability to do. Overcompensating can never make up for this feeling, and it is crucial to recognize the underlying issue to overcome it. Don't seek balance and worth in all the wrong places, true success comes from being genuine and accepting oneself."
