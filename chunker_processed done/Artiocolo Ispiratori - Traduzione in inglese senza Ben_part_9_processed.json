  "title": "\"The Power of Personal Magnetism: Understanding the Basis of Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the concept of \"personal power\" and how anyone can develop this force, even those who do not believe in magnetism. In this final part, we will delve deeper into the connection between magnetism and healing, as well as how it relates to our body and emotions. Through magnetism, we establish a powerful connection not just with our mind but with our body as well. It is through the body that we can directly influence our physiological processes and emotions. We will explore how the development of personal magnetism and healing are intertwined and why it is essential to develop this force from within ourselves.",
  "content": "These persons sometimes manage to achieve results in spite of the methodology guiding their steps, and which, in the hands of other, more intelligent and well-prepared people, might fail to engender the same result. We can reasonably assume that all of us, at varying levels, possess this capacity to heal, as well as that such capacity, like any other one, requires practice and self-discipline, and that it must necessitate gush out from inside ourselves in one form or the other. What we can observe is that its development runs parallel to the development of “personal magnetism”, to such an extent that we are entitled to state that, in reality, there is but one single type of magnetism. The poles and the body Through magnetism, we establish contact not just with the mind, but with the body as well, nay, especially with the body. It is precisely by using the body as our departure point that we are capable of acting directly both on a full range of physiological functions and on the physical foundation of emotions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we all have the capacity to heal and develop personal magnetism, which can be harnessed through self-discipline and practice. By establishing contact with the body, we can directly influence physiological functions and even the physical foundation of emotions. Remember that emotions should not be trapped in the body, and it is essential to let them flow freely. Children and animals are perfect examples of how emotions are not meant to last long, so learn from them and allow yourself to feel and let go."
