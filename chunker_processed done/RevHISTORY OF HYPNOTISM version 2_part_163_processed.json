  "title": "The Importance of Observing Currents in Magnetic Therapy",
  "first_phrase": "This article delves into the art of magnetism in the 18th century, providing valuable insights into what was then considered an innovative medical approach. Prior to explaining the role of currents in the process, the author emphasizes the importance of attuning oneself to the patient's pain, and the potential for that pain to be felt by the magnetizer if they do not withdraw from the affected organ. The last part of the text goes on to describe how to recognize and follow currents, which are vitally important for identifying disease locations, follow its development, and even predict the onset of a crisis.",
  "content": "The faculty of perceiving them is often acquired only after a time, longer or shorter; but when they are once recognized, you will follow them naturally, you magnetize as it were by instinct; you will second nature by carrying the vital action upon the deficient organ; you will augment or moderate your force at will. It is by these currents that the analogous organs of the magnetizer are sometimes affected. The currents will enable you to perceive a crisis which is at hand. They also indicate the moment when it is terminated, for then calmness is re-established. You are withdrawn far from the body, and you feel nothing further to attract you to it. They also enable you to discover the principal focus of the disease, and they direct you to follow all its ramifications. A very severe disorder of the liver, or of the spleen, or of some other viscus of the abdomen, is often accompanied with no pain in that organ; but it produces either headaches, or ophthalmias, or earaches, or appearances of an affection of the chest.",
  "last_phrase": "By following the natural currents of magnetism, you can enhance your inner sensitivity and gain the ability to perceive and treat underlying illnesses. Your intuition will guide you towards the principal focus of a disease and direct your actions towards aiding the work of nature. By developing this sensitivity, you can create a powerful synergy with your client and initiate a positive transformation, leading towards a healthier and happier life."
