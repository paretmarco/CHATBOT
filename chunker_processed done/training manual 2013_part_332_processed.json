  "title": "\"Developing Presence: Enhancing Perception and Communication Skills\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the concept of time and its relation to our perception of reality has been explored. The idea of living in the present moment is presented as a way to access a primal dimension and exit time. This is similar to the way children experience time differently from adults. In this final part of the text, the focus shifts to the skills a hypnotist must develop in order to communicate intelligently and intuitively with clients on all planes. The text includes a quote from philosopher Origen and mentions the concept of \"PRESENCE\" increasing magnetism. The idea of man in the form of a cross as an allusion to the four elements is also introduced.",
  "content": "There is no philosophical doubt as to the fact that, if I represent nothing to the others, I am for myself the most important being in existence. I am reality. What I am thus searching for is not a universal meaning, but a personal meaning attaching to my own actions, or, said it better, personality and universality are merged since I am the universe”. Man in the form of a cross (being an allusion to the four elements) why “PRESENCE” increases magnetism To improve his skills the hypnotist must develop the ability to perceive the world in a fuller way. This means he must be able not only to perceive in a rational way, but also through his right (non verbal) hemisphere, developing the language of feelings and intuition. Many exercises have the goal of developing subtle perceptions. In this way we can communicate intelligently, intuitively and with sensibility, at a subconscious level. We could call this kind of communication \"communication on all planes\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to enhance our ability to communicate intelligently, intuitively, and with sensitivity at a subconscious level, we must develop our awareness on all planes - spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical. By mastering and becoming aware of the components of perception, such as emotions, vision, and other sensations, we can improve our skills and increase our magnetism as hypnotists, ultimately becoming an example of presence to our clients."
