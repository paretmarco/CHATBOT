  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the chasing of pain in the body and the importance of using both hands in magnetic cures. Now, we'll delve into the second Commission and the works of Joseph Philippe François Deleuze, a literate magnetist. Deleuze observed the similarities in results between different methods of animal magnetism and established principles for its curative effects. He believed that practitioners work on two levels, physiological and psychical, and used case studies to prove the reality of magnetic influence. Let's explore his principles and gain insight into the power of animal magnetism.",
  "content": "You will soon discover that the headache is relieved or completely removed. The second Commission and how it revaluated mesmerism “And so under the strangest new vesture, the old great truth begins again to be revealed, — that man is what we call a miraculous creature, with miraculous power over men” Carlyle93 Joseph Philippe François Deleuze It is not everyday that we find a magnetist who is also literate. So when we do find them it is important to read their works in search for the answer to why and how in detail is it possible to heal people with the so -called ‘fluid’? M. Deleuze was a man of a high morality and standing. He was very methodical. By performing many observations, he observed the similarities in results between the different methods for doing animal magnetism. He notes that the therapist works on two levels: physiological and psychical. Having discovered the power of animal magnetism, he devoted himself chiefly to establishing the reality of the magnetic influence as a curative agent by records of cases and protracted arguments. He also set up some principles: GENERAL VIEWS AND PRINCIPLES. 1.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the study of animal magnetism led by M. Deleuze has shed light on the powerful influence of the human will over others. By establishing the reality of magnetic influence as a curative agent through his observations and principles, Deleuze has further highlighted the miraculous powers of man over his fellow beings. With this knowledge, we can further explore the possibilities of healing and influencing others in positive ways."
