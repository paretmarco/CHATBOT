  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the impact of Mesmer's magnetism is discussed as a turning point in European history. The emergence of magnetic phenomena in 1784 was significant and intriguing, leading to the diffusion of ancient practices that seemed to have magical effects. Interestingly, the upper and middle classes were most attracted to it. Philosophers like Schopenhauer believed it was practical metaphysics and that it could lead to the discovery of truths beyond the reach of natural science. In the end, Mesmer's absence was regretted, and people resorted to vain remedies, losing hope.",
  "content": "\"65 The insurgence of magnetism as a turning point in history \"Considered...[from] the philosophical point of view, animal magnetism is the most pregnant of all discoveries that have ever been made, altough for the time being it propounds rather than solves riddles. It is really practical metaphysics..[A] time will come when philosophy, animal magnetism, and natural science...will shed so bright a light on one another that truths will be discovered at which we could not otherwise hope to arrive\" (Schopenauer) Magnetism represents a turning point in European history. For historians, the emergence in 1784 of the magnetic phenomena is a very remarkable fact. It is apparently an enigma.66 At the very same moment when everything seemed to be explained we have an incredible diffusion of some practices that come from the most ancient past. These practices seem magical in their effects. And even more curious, it is not in the low level of the population that they find their first diffusion, but instead in the most cultivated and advanced. Magnetism has a very aristocratic and high level origin.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism marked a crucial turning point in history, providing a practical approach to metaphysics that shed light on natural science and philosophy. The diffusion of magical practices, originating from a high-level aristocratic tradition, brought about powerful results in healing. Mesmer's reactivation of ancient knowledge paved the way for the integration of traditional practices into modern healing frameworks, which continues to impact our lives today."
