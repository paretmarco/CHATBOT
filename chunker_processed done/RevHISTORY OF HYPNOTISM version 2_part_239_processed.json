  "title": "A Miraculous Cure: Magnetism and Prophetic Prediction",
  "first_phrase": "In this final 200 tokens of the text, we see the culmination of the story of a woman's struggle with scrofula and her quest for a cure through magnetism. She predicts that on the 24th of August, she will fall into a deep sleep and overcome her illness. Fifteen witnesses signed an attestation of her prediction, and several people gathered at her bedside to witness the event. The text gives a detailed account of the events leading up to this momentous occasion and the preparations that were made to ensure a successful outcome.",
  "content": "She declared further, that during this crisis of thirty hours, she would eat absolutely nothing; and that the scrofulous matter would be carried out of her system. She also said, that during her sleep a bruissement would be heard at the epigastrium, caused by the flow of scrofulous humours. She then predicted her perfect recovery. This declaration was made on the 14th of July, 1833. I made her repeat it on the 21st of the same month, in the presence of fifteen persons, who drew up and signed a report to this effect, having previously taken care to ascertain her scrofulous state. In the intervening period many persons took cognizance of the declaration, and promised, if her prediction were fulfilled, to attest so remarkable a case. On the 24th of August, at eight in the evening, it was arranged that several persons should assemble in the house of the patient, at the Petit-Carreau; and I enjoined her attendants to put her to bed half-an-hour before the accession of her crisis, in order to prevent her being annoyed. All this was punctually done. At nine o'clock precisely, a number of visitors had congregated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this case highlights the power of suggestion and belief in the human body's ability to heal itself. While the events of the crisis may seem alarming, the patient's prediction and eventual recovery demonstrate the potential for the mind and body to work together in overcoming illness. It's essential to take a holistic approach to healthcare, including mental and emotional well-being, in our understanding of health and healing."
