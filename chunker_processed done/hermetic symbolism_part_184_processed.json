  "title": "Symbolism and Tools of Initiation in Spiritual Practice",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author delves into the role of the initiate in the realm of mysticism and self-discovery, and the importance of tools like knives and swords in their journey. In the last part, we see the adept in the Holy of Holies, barefoot and in the company of a priestess of Isis, representing his faculties of intuition. We also see a basket with mysterious tools, possibly including the Philosophers’ Stone, which only the Wise man can understand its worth. The author highlights the importance of communication with divinized matter and the symbolism behind the adept's attire.",
  "content": "With shoes on, one is unable to feel that which emanates from the depths of the earth, from inside the inspiration of Iris. In front of the adept is a basket with some tools for writing or engraving. Among other things we can see a bundle that is difficult to describe, and which Mr de la Rive perceives to be ears of corn. The painter, who in general is quite good at representing objects, should have painted something different here. We cannot believe that it is an allusion to the password of the Companions43. It is probably some pencils, a ruler, an eraser and a pen. The two stones next to it could be Philosophers’ Stone material – rough and crude in appearance, that only the Wise man can discover its true worth. On the left of the Adept, wearing a kind of red habit (masculine activity, Jakin) is a woman dressed otherwise entirely in white (feminine receptivity, Bohas). This is the priestess of Isis, the inseparable companion of the adept, as she represents his faculties of intuition.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the painting provides a glimpse into the realm of alchemy and spiritual enlightenment. It reminds us that some truths cannot be explained by logic alone but require the illumination of the heart and intuition. It also highlights the importance of compassion and charity in one's spiritual journey, and the need to discover the true worth of things beyond their appearance. Let us keep these lessons in mind as we navigate through our lives."
