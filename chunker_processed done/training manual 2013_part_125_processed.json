  "title": "\"Exploring the Connection Between Time and Human Experience\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of time and how it affects different people and populations. It begins by discussing how staying in the past or future means staying virtually, and only in the present can we feel energy. The author quotes St. Augustine to illustrate this point. The text goes on to describe how time is perceived differently by different populations, such as the Quiche Indian tribe of Guatemala, who don't experience a flow of time. The author also explores the relationship between rational thinking and time, as well as the impact of self-consciousness on the linear concept of time. In particular, Ken Wilber believes that the development of linear time is linked to self-consciousness, and the ego plays a role in our perception of time.",
  "content": "Similarly, Edward T. Hall noticed that as well as having no words for time, the Hopi’s and Navaho’s grammar is no structured into past or future tenses. It seems as if they live in an \"eternal present\". \"For the Hopi\", as Hall writes, \"the experience of time must be more natural - like breathing or like a rhythmic part of life\"1. In addition to this, Hall has distinguished time into two categories: a \"monochronic\" time and a \"polychronic\" one. TIME, THINKING AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS With regard to rational thinking, it is very connected to time. Ken Wilber (in Up from Eden) links the development of linear time to the advent of a self-consciousness’s specific type. He explains the linearity of time in terms of a greater awareness of it brought by self-consciousness. If we imagine time in a linear way, we can imagine an afterlife. Another reason why we have linear time is by virtue of the presence of the ego.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our perception and understanding of time are deeply connected to our level of self-consciousness and thinking. While linear time can bring certain benefits, we should also be aware of its limitations and the potential to become too focused on the ego. By embracing a more natural and rhythmic experience of time, we can better appreciate the present moment and live a more fulfilling life."
