  "title": "\"Reabsorbing I-dentities into Essence and the Fixation of Attention\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the therapist guided the client to see and experience the I-dentities and Essence as made up of the same energy, leading to a sense of unity. In this concluding part, the author explains how reabsorbing the I-dentities back into Essence results in the recognition of that the Essence already is energy. Additionally, the text discusses the observer/personality dyad's fixation on being in control to cope with the trauma of loss of being and perception of emptiness. This fixation ultimately leaves the individual repressing their vulnerability and love.",
  "content": "Conclusion Once again we are reabsorbing the I-dentities of the personality back into Essence. The trauma of loss of Essence creates so much repressed energy (quanta) that the reabsorption acted like a sling-shotâ€”pulling back within itself the lost energy that had manifested outside of itself. This extra quanta (energy packet) provided the Essence with the energy it needed to recognize its own essential quality that it already is; or better said, to recognize itself as energy. I'M O.K. IF I'M IN CHARGE YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU LET ME BE IN CHARGE I n this strategy of fixating attention, the trauma of the loss of being and its perceived emptiness leaves the observer/per- sonality dyad with a loss of wholeness and a sense that there is no truth in the world. This fixation fears being seen as vulnerable and unwhole which leaves this personality repressing their vulnerability and love. In an attempt to fill the emptiness now covered with an unlovable/no-love experience. There is a feeling of a lack of fairness in the world for their loss of Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of fixation attention #8 can help us recognize and address any tendencies towards lustful and overcompensating behaviors. By acknowledging and accepting our vulnerabilities and the sense of loss of essence, we can begin to heal and rediscover our true essential qualities. Only then can we find peace and love within ourselves and in the world around us."
