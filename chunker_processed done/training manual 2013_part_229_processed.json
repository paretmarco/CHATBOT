  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored how binocular vision works and how it can be affected by altering the convergence of the ocular axes and by bringing subjects too close to a point of focus. In the last 200 tokens, we delve into the fascinating phenomenon of altered sensory perceptions and the creation of the \"big face.\" This is a physiological and psychological phenomenon that involves the apparent size of an object changing with shifts in the eye's focus distance. It can also be a sign of entering a specific state where the individual experiences a change in dimension. We'll explore the physiological basis of this phenomenon and how it can create a greater discrimination of detail.",
  "content": "CREATING ALTERATION IN SENSORY PERCEPTIONS - THE \"BIG FACE\" The apparent size of an object changes with shifts in the distance to which the eye is accommodated. This phenomenon happens in fascination, where the face of the operator becomes big and can even be a sign of entering a specific state as it is physiological as well as psychological as it touches what we call \"dimension\" of an object, that is also a psychological construction. For example, a six floors building occupies on the retina the same space as an object near, yet we are able to judge its size, even with an eye closed. There is also a physiological correlate: the more distant the individualâ€™s dark focus, the greater his or her tendency to focus beyond an acuity target and to maximize apparent size. This will create a greater discrimination of detail.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding how alterations in sensory perceptions occur and the physiological and psychological factors involved can help us discern between reality and illusions. By grasping how distance affects our visual perception, we can exercise greater discrimination of detail and avoid potential dangers, especially in fields such as aviation. While diploplia may not occur frequently in our daily life, it is still an essential phenomenon to understand, as it demonstrates the intricacy of our perception system."
