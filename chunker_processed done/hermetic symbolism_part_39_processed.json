  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the constructive oppositions of a philosophical mentality, with the Right Angle being the emblem of practical wisdom. The Cross in the center of the Circle represents the inseparable unity of the active and passive, which is the symbol of the fertilized egg. In this final part, the author delves into the significance of Verdigris and its representation of actual life. They go on to explain the balanced life force of the vegetable kingdom and the active force in the animal kingdom. Moreover, the author sheds light on the symbolic representation of Vitriol and its connection with animal magnetism.",
  "content": "The Cross in itself, with arms that can extend infinitely, represents indefinite, abstract life, without concrete application. Vitriol The rigorous balancing of the life force, with active and passive in equal proportions, is characteristic of the vegetable kingdom. In comparison, in the animal kingdom, the scales are tipped in favour of activity, while minerals are stabilised by the predominance of the passive life force. Graphically, these three life modalities can be represented in the following way: Animal - Imbalance, due to excess vitality Vegetable – Full equilibrium Mineral – Stability, due to predominant passivity. The signs and are not used to designate any of the substances in the alchemical laboratory; however and are linked to green and blue vitriol, respectively. We will not dwell on copper sulphate and iron sulphate here, as the practicalities of chemistry lead away from purely speculative hermeticism. The signs are used solely in reference to occult knowledge. In the Vitriol sign we see animal Vitality in its dual form of feminine fluid and masculine fluid . Mesmer’s concept of animal magnetism was taken from Alchemy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical concept of Vitriol represents the balancing and harmonizing of the life force, with animal vitality, vegetable equilibrium, and mineral stability. The Vitriol sign serves as a symbol for the dual form of feminine and masculine fluidity and as a reminder that the true path to self-transformation lies within, by retreating within the depths of oneself, rectifying the substance, and finding the hidden Stone which holds the True Medicine."
