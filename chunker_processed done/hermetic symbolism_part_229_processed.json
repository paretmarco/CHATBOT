  "title": "\"The Quantum Science of Cooling Down Reality\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the information-gathering process and how it modifies the world. In the last 200 tokens, we will explore the idea of lowering temperature and its connection to creating information. As the cloud of steam cools, it turns into droplets of water, breaking the uniform symmetry of the cloud and creating more organization and information. Further lowering the temperature creates solid ice, creating even more organization and blocking itself in just one possibility. This final state of cooling down is likened to 'Earth' by the Ancients, where the process ends, and expressed with an arrow pointing downwards. Our minds make sense of this tangible universe and order the universe, creating unfreezing possibilities.",
  "content": "Lowering the temperature has (1) broken the symmetry of the cloud leading to the (2) organization of water droplets so you now have (3) information at about the direction of up and down. As the temperature lowers further to zero degrees there is another 'symmetry breaking' leading to another , the phase transition of water as it is further organized through crystallization , turning into solid ice. This is the reality that has blocked itself in just one possibility. It is the “iced” reality in which human beings live. Skating about on the solid ice you now have a vast amount more information, since you now have the four directions - north, south, east and west. Once again symmetry breaking is accompanied by an increase in organization and information. In the same way, as we measure the universe, we \"cool it down\" from its original undefined state.\" The ancients compared this final state of cooling down as 'Earth' , where this process has its final end, and expressed it with an arrow pointing down , blocked in its state. Un-freezing the universe of possibles Our mind makes order of the universe creating a tangible universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to unfreeze the universe of possibilities, we must remember that we ourselves froze the reality we live in. By awakening our internal fire, represented by the symbol of sulphur, we can gain new perspectives and unlock previously hidden information about the world around us."
