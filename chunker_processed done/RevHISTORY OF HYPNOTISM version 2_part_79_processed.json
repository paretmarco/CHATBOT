  "content": "Mesmer’s inner sense, the basis of all sensations, reveals things that common sensory experience withhold. In Mesmer’s words the internal sense is “related to the whole universe\". It can perceive distant past and future events” While any one sense conveyed only a speci?c sort of impression, the “sensorium commune” receives whole impressions of the world outside. Its role in sensationist physiology and psychology is to embody the mind's openness to the world. Accordingly, Mesmer's sixth sense, which was not an organ, but a wholistic synergy, registers the movements of the universal ?uid through which all events reverberated. Here too we see a similitude with the modern quantum theory: In a nutshell, the holographic super-theory says that our brains mathematically construct ‘hard’ reality by interpreting frequencies from a dimension transcending time and space. The brain is a hologram perceiving a holographic universe.35 Practical hint: Feel yourself in contact with the whole. Practice disciplines that help you go in this direction such as meditation. It ought to be observed that when the forces of Nature are set in motion by the will or ‘soul’, it can act at the level of the fluid.",
