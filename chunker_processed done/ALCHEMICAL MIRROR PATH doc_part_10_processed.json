  "title": "\"Exercises for Developing Vision and Perception Beyond Physical Limits\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed an exercise involving a mirror to develop psychophysiological reactions. But there's another exercise that is equally useful: standing in a completely dark room with closed eyes, trying to recreate the experiences from the mirror exercise. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the various physical and fluidic phenomena that one may experience during the mirror exercise. The author mentions first-stage physical phenomena, such as fog and milky colors, and second-stage fluidic phenomena, including visions and communication with distant individuals. The operator must attain specific abilities by practicing particular exercises.",
  "content": "After it will change its quality again taking a milky colour - at the beginning it will be just like a sensation - but after you will hawe a strange complete darkness where you will anyway see the boundaries of physical objects, surrounded by a strange light that could cover all ranges of the iris, from red to violet, with shades and tints unimaginable. Do not believe that the above experiences could be experienced with the same rapidity with which you read ... You will easily observe something as the first auras (even something as human radiation could be visible), magnetic and mental, the latter with a particular intensity, and their growth and acting, that could be increased practicing particular exercises. VISIONS IN THE FLUIDIC LEVEL - SECOND STAGE (? ?“The waters”) At this point, visions could be possible. The operator can open himself to this new dimension and this requires a slightly controlled passive state open to perception. Communication and vision of far people can be obtained at this point.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the fluidic level provides an incredible opportunity for visions, communication with far-off individuals, and a heightened perception of mental and magnetic energies. While this stage requires some controlled passivity, practicing certain exercises can help operators amplify their abilities. The experience cannot be rushed as the quality of the observation constantly evolves, leading to complete darkness where the operator's consciousness resounds."
