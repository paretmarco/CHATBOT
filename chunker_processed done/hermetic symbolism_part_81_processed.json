  "title": "\"The Great Work: The Art of Thinking and Alchemical Symbolism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the Great Work, a supreme labor of divine creation achieved through the art of thinking. To become part of this work, the Sage must achieve perfection and transform himself from a Rough Stone to a Philosophers' Stone. The use of symbols by ancient masons correlates with those of alchemists, particularly in their reference to the Stone. However, the language of hermetic philosophers should not be taken literally, and many who attempt chemical manipulations fail to understand its true meaning. In the concluding 200 tokens, the author warns against such thoughtless pursuits and emphasizes the importance of mastering the Great Art.",
  "content": "The symbols that the ancient masons used, in fact, match those of the alchemists, at least insofar as their reference to the Stone, which according to Eliphas Levi, the great occultist of the previous century, represents “in the order of the divine, the true religion; in the order of humanity, the true universal science, square in its foundations, solid like the cube, absolute like mathematics; in the natural order, the physical truth, that which makes the sovereign and sacred nature accessible to man, turning him into a king and a priest of the Light that perfects the soul and vanquishes appearances, changes beasts into men, thorns into roses and lead into gold.” Common spirits remember nothing but this last statement. Many thoughtless persons set themselves to chemical manipulations, without realising that the language of the hermetic philosophers should not be taken literally.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbols used by ancient masons and alchemists were not to be taken literally in the context of chemical manipulations, but rather as a metaphor for achieving spiritual perfection. The true transmutation was not of ordinary metals, but of the soul. The pursuit of material wealth was shunned by true philosophers, and instead, their focus was on the greater good of humanity, using their knowledge to bring light and morality to the world."
