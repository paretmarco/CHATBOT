  "title": "Inner Healing: Reabsorbing I-dentities into Essence.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the therapist guided the client to connect with their internal parts and identify their deepest desires. In this final part, the therapist takes the session to a new level by inviting the client to see their identities as energy and experience the essential unity of their being. By doing this, the client realizes that their desires are interconnected, and they experience a profound sense of oneness. The therapist's strategy in this session is in line with the internal family systems approach that focuses on accessing and unifying different parts of oneself.",
  "content": "Client: (nods) Therapist: Now go down to your pelvis. Client: Okay. Therapist: Ask the sexual I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: Fulfillment. Therapist: Ask the inadequate I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: Wholeness. Therapist: Now from back there feel the wholeness and fulfillment of \"back there.\" Client: Okay. Therapist: Now, notice the empty space these I-dentities are floating in. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now see the I-dentities as being made of energy. ________________ Client: Okay. Therapist: Now experience the Essence as being made of the same energy as the I-dentities. Client: Wow, it's all one. Therapist: How are you doing? Client: No words...just silence. Therapeutic Note Here I added the third variation. In this variation, the I-dentities are de-labeled and seen as energy, and the Essence is being seen and experienced as being made of the same energy as the I-dentities. This offers the energic unity of Essence and observer/personality dyad.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of de-labeling the I-dentities and recognizing the Essence as being made of the same energy as the I-dentities can offer a sense of energic unity and reabsorption of the personality back into Essence. This recognition can help individuals recognize their own essential qualities and find fulfillment and wholeness in themselves."
