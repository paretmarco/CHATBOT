  "title": "\"Exploring Magnetism and Its Comparisons in Medicine and Physics\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of magnetism and Mesmerism, and how they can enhance modern hypnosis and other techniques. In the concluding section, Dr. Paret highlights the valuable insights of Dr. J. Coates and presents some basic exercises of the magnetic school. He also compares Magnetism to Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern Quantum Theories, showing how they all focus on the flow of energy and perception. To learn the practical instructions of Magnetism, Dr. Paret advises seeking guidance from experienced instructors or practitioners.",
  "content": "I personally practiced them in conjunction with NLP, Ericksonian Hypnosis, and many other modern techniques, and I can testify that the effectiveness of all these techniques is enhanced by somebody knowing magnetism. Furthermore, our students had powerful results. In magnetism there is a REAL POWER which anyone can acquire if they carefully follow the instructions. The Magnetic School has its roots in what before was called “magic” and a certain type of magic can be easily understood through the lens of magnetism. Comparison between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Mesmerismus Traditional Chinese Medicine speaks of energy flows. Mesmerism also speaks of energy flows. Coates’ work doesn’t specifically deal with it, but there are many western traditions outlining techniques such as the “magnetic massage” and specific types of passes and touches. Comparison between Modern Quantum Theories and Mesmerismus The idea of Quantum Theories is that it is the way we look at reality that shapes our reality. This point of view coincides with the one of Magnetism. The goal of the school of magnetism is to bring the adept to a certain view of the world. The world is as we perceive it because we perceive it so.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning about magnetism and mastering its techniques can greatly enhance the effectiveness of modern therapies such as NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis. The Magnetic School teaches individuals how to harness the real power of magnetism and understand ancient practices such as magnetic massage. Additionally, the quantum theories that shape our understanding of reality are similar to the way magnetism views the world, offering a new perspective on the fluid-like substance that exists around us."
