  "title": "Understanding Psychopathy and the Context of Behavior.",
  "first_phrase": "This article discusses the difference between having a psychopathic structure or trance and being a psychopath. Prior to this, the author reveals that almost all men who are sexual abusers were sexually abused themselves, but only a few come to therapy for treatment of sexual dysfunction due to society's psychopathology and the hypnotic trance given to the young boy. The author explains that feeling powerless with a deep inner sense of helplessness, individuals with a psychopathic #8 over-compensate, becoming and imagining themselves to have more power than they do, and will seek revenge when feeling victimized. The larger context in which behavior occurs is also an essential aspect of psychotherapy that is not appreciated enough.",
  "content": "Feeling powerless with a deep inner sense of helplessness, the psychopathic #8 over-compensates, becoming and imagining themselves to have more power than they do. Inwardly, like #6, they feel victimized by any question about their power and authority. Feeling victimized, they attack and seek revenge. Unlike #6 whose underlying state is motivated by fear, #8 has an underlying state of anger. This anger defends against the real issue, the injustice that took place around trauma of the loss of Essence. They will then manufacture a story which will validate all of the necessary reasons for their vindictiveness. What is not appreciated in psychotherapy is the larger context in which a behavior occurs. Family therapists were the first to expand the explanation of behavior of children and adolescents to include the larger context, i.e., the family, in which the behavior manifested. In the same way, our society often asks individuals to behave in psychopathic ways. For example, in the Vietnam War, we asked pilots to drop bombs on villages in Southeast Asia. The pilots were hypnotized by society into believing that \"life is cheap or unimportant\" to Asians.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the larger context in which behaviors occur, including the societal and cultural values that may contribute to psychopathic tendencies. By acknowledging these factors, we can work towards creating a society that prioritizes empathy and compassion over violence and dehumanization."
