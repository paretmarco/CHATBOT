  "title": "\"Distant Magnetism and Magnetic Ecstasy: Exploring the Power of Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explained the concept of magnetism as a tool to broaden knowledge and explore new universes. It defined magnetism as a technique that demands the entirety of our mind, our body, and our individuality. The text then proposes an exercise that can help develop the \"feeling\" of magnetism and be useful for distant healing, involving raising someone's eyelids, directing mental suggestions, and working on a person to become a sort of catalyst channel. The author compares this phenomenon with quantum entanglement in physics. This concluding part briefly mentions the ancient Western tradition represented by the athanor and explores the upper level and magnetic ecstasy.",
  "content": "Put one person in a room and the other in the next room on the same wall ( back to back) with closed eyes Choose one of them and bring him in a magnetic state (Try to lead him into catalepsy) (optional) Raise his eyelids a couple of times and direct him to look at a light Send him some mental suggestions or images (light, wellness, heat..) Working on a person means that he becomes a sort of catalyst channel (channelling) for the other one It's a good method to practise for distant healing. Note: This phenomenon is very similar to quantum entanglement in physics The upper level and Magnetic Ecstasy?? An ancient Western tradition is represented by the athanor.",
  "last_phrase": "Using the method described above, practicing distant healing through magnetic ecstasy and channelling can bring about positive changes in physical and mental well-being. By understanding the ancient traditions of the athanor and the Eastern concept of the three tan tien, we can explore the potential of the human body and consciousness."
