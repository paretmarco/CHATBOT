  "title": "\"Phreno-mesmeric Processes: Direct Communication with the Brain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the phreno-mesmeric process and how it can stimulate certain faculties of the brain to produce psychological phenomena. The mesmeric state induces a dormant state in the animal brain and phreno-mesmerism can stimulate certain organs into activity under the control of the mesmerist. The author argues that phreno-mesmerism is superior to Charcot's automatic suggestion and produces direct communication with the organ of the mind. The process involves putting the subject in deep unconscious sleep and touching the organs to be affected. The author emphasizes the living sensitive being in a state of mental exaltation produced by this process.",
  "content": "By the former, we have direct communication with the brain—the organ of the mind; by the latter, mechanical and inhibitory suggestions are indirectly conveyed to the brain, and automatically responded to. By the former we have a living sensitive being, in a certain state of mental exaltation, giving forth some perfect manifestations of such psychological state. In the latter, you have a degraded tool, a helpless piece of organic machinery—a marionette, “pull the strings and the figure moves.” The phreno-mesmeric process is as follows:— Put your subject in a deep unconscious sleep. As you can demesmerise or stimulate a leg or arm into activity, recognise the fact—the same can be accomplished with the brain, consciousness can be restored partially or wholly. The mind, directed by the influence of the operator, determindedly applied to the organ of the faculty desired to be aroused, by touching the organ or organs which you desire to affect, almost immediately the arterial blood is attracted and propelled with greater force through that portion of the brain; the faculty, or faculties, become exalted, or inspired.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the phreno-mesmeric process allows for the manipulation of specific areas of the brain through mechanical and inhibitory suggestions, resulting in various manifestations of psychological states. By selectively exciting different faculties, one can achieve a range of specific behaviors in the subject, such as language fluency, musical ability, devotional attitude, and even aggression. With proper guidance and responsible use of this technique, it may lead to a better understanding of the human brain and its potential capabilities."
