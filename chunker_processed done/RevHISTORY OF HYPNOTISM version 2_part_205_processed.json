  "title": "\"The Eclipse of Animal Magnetism in Academic Circles\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the decline of animal magnetism in academic circles between 1800 and 1820 due to the divisions among magnetizers and the attacks by academies against unorthodox healings. The use of blind assessment as a tool to combat unconventional healers and prove scientific legitimacy further complicated the situation. In this concluding section, we delve deeper into the mysteries of magnetism and its healing abilities that continue to baffle science today. We'll examine how it works on animals, and the challenge of explaining its efficacy in Newtonian terms. Ultimately, we will see how magnetism can be understood in quantum terms, opening up new possibilities for research and healing.",
  "content": "Blind assessment was a prominent feature in the medical tug-of-war with these “irregulars” and became the ultimate tool to test and demonstrate that these practitioners were “unscientific” and selling bogus goods. Unconventional healers sometimes responded by adopting the method as a touchstone for proving their own claims of efficacy. In its early development, blind assessment was not articulated into a systematic methodology, but was regularly dusted off and used to either combat potential quackery or gain access to scientific respectability. Especially in the initial phases, it tended to be used in an ad hoc manner to demarcate or proclaim legitimacy whenever the boundary conflict between conventional and deviant became especially contentious. The most important conflicts that utilized blind assessment were mesmerism and homeopathy.”96 The fact is that magnetism is still a mystery today. It also works on animals, but cannot be measured. It heals, and there are accounts of thousands of healings even today, but no scientific accepted Newtonian science can explain why it happens. We can think of it in quantistic terms.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, blind assessment was used as a tool to either discredit or legitimize unconventional healers in the face of boundary conflicts with conventional medicine. Despite its widespread use, there are still mysteries in alternative healing practices such as magnetism and hypnosis that science has yet to fully understand. However, the evidence of thousands of healings and unbiased observations by scientists suggest that these phenomena do indeed exist."
