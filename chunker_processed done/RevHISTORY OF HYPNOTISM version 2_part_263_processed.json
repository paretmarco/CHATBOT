  "title": "\"How to Speed Up Magnetism for Faster Results\"",
  "first_phrase": "This 200-token text is part of a larger piece discussing the practice of Magnetism in the 19th century. It highlights the challenges faced by physicians who practiced Magnetism due to the time-consuming nature of individualized treatments, and the subsequent success of Magnetic physicians who could treat more patients in less time. However, the text also explores possible ways to speed up the process of Magnetism, such as enhancing one's own energy and vitality, mixing fascination and magnetism or using symbols that speak to the unconscious mind. The text references historical figures such as Mesmer and modern magnetists like Andalini and Alalouf. It concludes by noting that while Magnetism can work without these methods, it requires immense faith and patience on the part of both the doctor and the patient.",
  "content": "Fascination though, has always been a closed school; moreover, many magnetizers want to resort to magnetism alone, without attending to psychological differences between individuals. That sometimes can hinder the needed sensitivity. A third one is by using symbols which speak directly to the non- rational and unconscious mind. Applying even only one of these three systems speeds up the results incredibly. Sometimes we can get results in instants. For example Mesmer used the first two systems, and the third one in the societies of Harmony, where symbols were on the walls to activate the unconscious reactions. Our Master Prof. Erminio Di Pisa used mainly the gaze to achieve his instant healings. Andalini or Alalouf, modern magnetists living in Italy and in France instead used their energy and got results in few minutes. Magnetism can even work without the application of any one or all of these three aforementioned methods, but this demands immense faith and patience from both doctor and patient; and it seriously curtailed the practice, and therefore the income, of any doctor who devoted himself exclusively to magnetic treatment.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while magnetism can work on its own, greater results can be achieved by combining three systems: fascination, psychological sensitivity, and symbols. However, the art of magnetism requires devotion and daily work on oneself to develop sensitivity and get fast results. By doing this, magnetism becomes a powerful tool for healing and transformation."
