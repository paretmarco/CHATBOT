  "title": "What is Dupotet's \"magic mirror\" and how does it affect the mind through polarized light and psychological energy?",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the curious practices of Dupotet, a magnetist who worked with mirrors to induce visions in his subjects. The passage recounts the experience of those who gazed into Dupotet's \"magic mirror,\" made of charcoal on the floor, and saw terrifying, delightful or humorous visions. However, upon waking, the subjects had little to no recollection of what had occurred. Some of Dupotet's experiments involved psychometry, where the mirror was covered with dry earth, and the subject saw visions of human sacrifice. This peculiar practice had a strong \"fascination\" over onlookers, who often engaged in physical confrontation to occupy the mirror.",
  "content": "That Suggestion may have entered into these visions is very possible, but Dupotet says, and repeats it more than once, that his subjects were ignorant of what was to occur; that no word was spoken; that the person experimented upon was, in many cases, a stranger called in on the spot, who had never heard of Magnetism. A kind of psychometry seems to have entered into some of his experiments; for instance, on one occasion he covered the mirror with some dry earth taken from an ancient Druidical monument, and the “percipient” saw a vision of five human victims being sacrificed, the singular thing being that five skeletons were found in the place from which the earth was taken. These figures drawn by Dupotet on the floor exercised a powerful “fascination”; it often happened that those merely looking on at the experiment were seized by the “magic” influence, and rushed forward to peer into the mirror, violently pushing aside anyone who was in their way, and having quite a battle with the person already in possession of the mirror.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the use of mirrors in experimental settings has produced fascinating results throughout history, modern science can now explain why they have such a profound impact on the mind. Reflecting one's energy and creating polarized light effects, mirrors enhance inner perceptions and allow subconscious elements to become more evident. The power of mirrors is not to be underestimated, as demonstrated by the research done by Dr. Lefebure."
