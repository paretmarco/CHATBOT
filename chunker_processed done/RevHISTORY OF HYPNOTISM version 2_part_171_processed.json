  "title": "\"Silence and Methods in Animal Magnetism and Modern Approach\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the history and different methods of animal magnetism. Now, in the final part, we will examine the differences between the instructions given by the modern suggestionist school and the magnetizers of the experimental and Mesmeric schools. These schools prescribed complete silence during the process to induce the magnetic condition, but differed in their approach to introspection and the production of crises. It is fascinating to see how theories of magnetism evolved and diverged during the 18th and 19th centuries.",
  "content": "The experimental school The Experimental school enjoined silence, and told their patients not to examine their own sensations, but to \"think of nothing,\" because it was found that any disturbance, bodily or mental, caused an arrest of the magnetising process at the \"intermediate\" stage; and they regarded that arrest as a misfortune, because the subject then became a mere echo of the operator, a mere automaton in his hands; and this not only prevented the development of introvision and “medical instinct,” on which the magnetic physician placed great reliance for diagnosis and prescription, but it made the production of the deep sleep and cataleptic rigidity more difficult; and on these, instead of on the crises, the magnetizers of the Experimentalist school depended greatly for the general health-giving effect of Magnetism, as distinguished from the curative action of local passes, breathings, and other manipulations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the Experimental school's approach to mesmerism emphasized silence, introvision, and health-giving effects through cataleptic rigidity, Milton Erickson's modern approach differs in its focus on non-verbal communication, energy, and higher consciousness. Both systems acknowledge the influence of suggestion, but the Experimentalists deemed it less significant. Ultimately, understanding the history and evolution of such psycho-physical phenomena can deepen our knowledge of the mind and body's interconnectedness."
