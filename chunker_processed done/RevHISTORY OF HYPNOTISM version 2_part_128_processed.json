  "title": "\"Mesmerism and the Science of Magnetic Fluid\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the rise of mesmerism and the practices associated with Mesmer's School. Now, let's explore how mesmerism was perceived and practiced in different countries. In Germany, mesmerism was fully accepted and practiced and even became the main treatment at a public hospital. It was also perceived as a means of seeking universal truths. On the other hand, in France, practitioners approached mesmerism differently. Let's delve into the differences in the practices and theories of mesmerism in France compared to Germany. Additionally, we will introduce you to the prominent names in the field, including Professor Ennemoser and eminent physician Hufeland.",
  "content": "The eminent Hufeland, originally an unbeliever, was the principal physician of this hospital; and fifteen volumes containing the clinical details of the cases treated magnetically were published68. Mesmerism was also very developed in Germany under a philosophical point of view. The German mesmerists showed the romanticist attraction to seeking universal truths. They perceived in Mesmer's magnetic fluid the justification for the notion that the Universe was a living organism. Mesmers’ idea of a sixth sense which endowed humans in trance with prophetic abilities and getting in touch with the whole universe, moved them to search how this technique would enable the human mind to communicate with the “World Soul”.69 France The other party, located chiefly in France, worked in other directions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the study and practice of mesmerism and magnetic fluid had two main schools of thought in Germany and France. Both aimed at healing by manipulating the vital force and universal energy. The methods included passes, breathing, fixation and concentration of will. Understanding the spirit of these ideas can assist in developing willpower and potentially aid in health and well-being."
