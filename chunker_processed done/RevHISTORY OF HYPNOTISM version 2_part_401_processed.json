  "title": "\"What is Mesmerism and can it be used for painless medical procedures?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens provide an account of a case study on Elizabeth O'Key, who suffered from epilepsy and was treated with \"Mesmerism,\" a term used to describe \"animal magnetism.\" These notes were taken by a medical student and describe how Elizabeth's epilepsy was treated using Mesmerism, and how the fits of delirium caused by the condition were removed by this technique. In this state of delirium, she cannot remember what happens to her or see the absurdity of certain situations. The notes also mention the placement of a seton in the back of her neck.",
  "content": "Latterly, it has been ascertained that this delirium might be produced artificially by Mesmerism, and that it might be done without the patient being aware that the process was going on. In short, the delirium may be induced and removed without her knowledge. It is not necessary to the production of this effect that any movements should be made with the hand, or even that the hand should be used at all. Any person may produce this effect, and also remove it. In this delirium she does not remember what takes place in her natural state, nor in her natural state does she remember what takes place in the delirium; but she distinctly remembers from one fit to another, though she has no idea of time, saying that a circumstance which occurred a month ago happened within a minute. She can recognise persons; but is not able to see the absurdity of a man being her mother! To describe all the peculiarities of her case would be almost impossible; it must be seen to be understood. A few days since it was found necessary to place a seton in the back of her neck.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of Mesmerism to induce delirium and remove pain without the knowledge of the patient is a fascinating field of study that warrants further investigation by medical professionals. With the potential to perform painless surgeries and procedures, the effectiveness and safety of Mesmerism deserves more attention and research."
