  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, a therapist offers a do-able exercise to help a client develop self-awareness. In this last part, the author reflects upon the importance of such practices for personal growth and maturity. The text explores the concept of the observer/personality dyad and the trauma of fixating attention. The author cites Fritz Perls, M.D.'s thoughts on self-support and highlights the consequences of failure to connect with one's essence. Overall, the text conveys the importance of developing self-awareness and offers insights on how to achieve it.",
  "content": "The question is always, \"How can I live my life and stay in this space?\" The answer is to offer exercises that are do-able. In this case I look for a way for him to move from Essence to personality and from personality to Essence. This reinforces the integration process and empowers him to develop self-awareness on his own without me. Not needing me to guide him, he can proceed on his own. To quote Fritz Perls, M.D. ; \"Maturity is the transcendence from environmental support to self-support.\" Z N O 4t r-- z co — i• - \"I'M 0.K. IF I'M FILLING MYSELF UP, YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU'RE FIWNG ME UP\" • iiii 15ike all other strategies of fixating atten- tion, the #7 observer/personality dyad suffers the trauma of loss of being and a Zarli4 gnawing inner-emptiness. When the observer/ Laj 16■ personality dyad organizes around the Essence 0 there is an inner sense of scarcity on the first rung of the pendulum. This leads to a deep feel- >. ing of meaninglessness and ultimately to glut- V tony to fill the empty space.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing exercises that promote self-awareness and support the integration process, one can transcend from relying on external support to self-support. This shift allows individuals to fill their own emptiness, overcome feelings of worthlessness, and resist the unhealthy fixation of attention that can lead to obsessive behaviors. Ultimately, empowering oneself to navigate life independently and mindfully."
