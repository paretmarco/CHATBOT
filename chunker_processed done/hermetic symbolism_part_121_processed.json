  "title": "\"The Seven Types of Personalities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, the author explores three different personality types: The Peaceful Type, The Conqueror, and The Egoist. Each type is defined by the shifting of the Soul, Spirit, and Body circles in relation to the planets representing various qualities. In contrast to the previous sections, where the planets in focus were Saturn and the Moon, here the attention is directed towards Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. The author examines the character traits associated with each configuration, including ambition, sensitivity, judgment and altruism. The section concludes by discussing the implications of Venus gaining the upper hand over Mercury, Jupiter and Mars, giving rise to The Altruist.",
  "content": "The Conqueror The inverse operation, which causes Mars to gain ground over Mercury , means that the Soul , the Spirit and the body gain in the areas where Jupiter and Venus lose. This time there is voracious activity, but it does not act blindly, because it is illuminated by reason that does not hinder the scruples of the conscience at all; it also benefits from a vigorous organism that is not excessively sensitive; on the other hand, the Soul surrenders itself to the most ambitious dreams. The Egoist As the Spirit circle moves away from Venus it reinforces the central personality , as well as the territory of Jupiter and Mars; but Spirit , Soul and Body suffer from the corresponding reduction in their sphere of influence. So, our character feels self-important: he is intelligent, which helps to satisfy his Jupiterian ambition; but lacks sensitivity, although he uses the scant vitality of his organism well. On the other hand, his judgement is cloudy and his dreams are disturbed by ambitious aspirations. The Altruist As the Spirit circle slides away it ensures that Venus is dominant, gaining the upper hand over Mercury , while Jupiter and Mars give way to the Soul and the Body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the relationship between the planets and the Self can provide valuable insights into our individual personalities. While striving for balance may not be easy, it is essential to avoid straying too far from the human norm, allowing us to specialize and excel in our unique paths while still maintaining our humanity."
