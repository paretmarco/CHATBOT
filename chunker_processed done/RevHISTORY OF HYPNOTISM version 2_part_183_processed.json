  "title": "Understanding Magnetism: The Power of the Will and Sympathy",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of magnetism, which is the ability of an individual to exert influence on another individual. The text establishes the importance of exercising the will to act, and the role of belief and confidence in realizing one's powers. It goes on to explain the notion of a magnetic fluid, which is believed to transmit energy between individuals. Finally, the text outlines the three types of magnetism: physical, spiritual, and mixed, and how sympathy plays a role in establishing communication between individuals. In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses the conditions necessary for magnetizing, including the will, confidence, and benevolence. It highlights the importance of establishing a moral and physical sympathy between individuals, in order to create effective communication.",
  "content": "It follows that there are three actions in magnetism: first, physical; second, spiritual; third, mixed action. It will soon be seen how easy it is to distinguish the phenomena which belong to each. 7. If the will is necessary …, belief is necessary to induce one to make a firm and steady use of the faculties he possesses. Confidence in the power we possess, makes us act without effort and without distraction. …. 8. In order that one individual may act upon another, there must exist between them a moral and physical sympathy; as there is between all the members of an animated body. Physical sympathy is established by means which we shall indicate: moral sympathy by the desire of doing good to one who desires to receive it; or by ideas and wishes which, occupying them both equally, forms between them a communication of sentiments. When this sympathy is well established between two individuals, we say, they are in communication. 9. Thus the first condition for magnetizing, is the will; the second is the confidence which the magnetizer has in his own powers; the third is benevolence, or the desire of doing good.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism involves three actions: physical, spiritual, and mixed. The three conditions necessary for magnetizing are a strong will, confidence in one's own abilities, and a desire to do good. It is important to establish a moral and physical sympathy between the magnetizer and the individual being acted upon. Magnetism is an empirical practice with results that can only be explained by quantum theory."
