  "title": "What is Dupotet's theory on the power of suggestion and how it can create reality?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the fascinating theories and practices of Dupotet, a magnetizer who believed that humans can create their own reality. In the preceding tokens, Dupotet's stance on the subject experiencing sensorial phenomena was explained, as opposed to merely believing in them. Furthermore, he claimed that magnetisers can \"install\" their own souls into their subjects, enabling them to transform into anyone, alive or dead. Dupotet's use of verbal suggestion, which he associated with physical acts, was also touched upon. Ultimately, Dupotet's belief that magnetism is the connection between soul and matter is the key takeaway.",
  "content": "\"That, of course, is a common experiment of the electro-biologists; and is known in Hypnotism by the name its \"discoverer\" Charles Richet gave it-\"the objectivation of types.\" What Dupotet teaches us: we create our reality. We can reach a quantum level where things which are normally impossible become possible. Dupotet also practised what is now known as ‘verbal suggestion,’ a phenomenon now used by all schools of Hypnotism for the cure of disease. But Dupotet complicated verbal suggestion in a curious way, by associating it with some physical act or thing, which, according to his magical theory, was the vehicle for the transmission of magnetic influence, for he thought that Magnetism is the connecting link between soul and matter, or the agent by which the soul acts on the body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dupotet's teachings on creating our reality and the power of verbal suggestion are still relevant today in the field of Hypnotism. His belief in the connection between soul and matter and the ability to transfer magical power through physical objects is a reminder that there may be more to our existence than we realize. The experiment of putting a man in a hypnotic state by suggestion with an object demonstrates the power of the mind over the body and the potential for achieving the seemingly impossible."
