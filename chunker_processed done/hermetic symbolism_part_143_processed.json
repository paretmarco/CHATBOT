  "title": "\"The Importance of the Philosophical Fire in Alchemy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the text delves deeper into the concept of how individuals can connect with the collective and access mysterious forces outside themselves. The focus is on Column B, which is believed to contain the life-giving essence that penetrates souls, fanning the ardor at their core. This substance is known as the Steel of the Sages and it corresponds to the fiery cloud that serves as a receptacle for higher virtues. The adept have seen it as the key to the philosophical work and a mine of philosophical gold. This is the conclusion of an insightful discourse on the journey of self-discovery and the mysteries of alchemy.",
  "content": "Rising up to the north, facing the moon whose sweet and feminine whiteness is reflected in it, this column corresponds to the alchemists’ Mercury, the foundation of that life-giving essence that penetrates souls, continuously fanning the ardour F at their cores. When this ardour is violently expelled, as is required by the glowing heat of the matter (Fire test), a relative vacuum arises in the core of the being that works like a magnet to attract the “Steel of the Sages”. This substance, whose ideogram combines Steel with Alum, or Fire with Antimony, corresponds to the flaming mantle that envelops the Initiate when he is purified by Fire. It is the ethereal atmosphere or the fiery cloud that serves as a receptacle for the higher virtues. The adept have seen within it “the key to the whole philosophical work, the miracle of the world, sealed by the crest of God himself”. And they add that it is the mine of philosophical gold, a primordially pure spirit, a secret and volatile infernal fire that can be likened to the quintessence of all the stuff of the Universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemist's Mercury, the Steel of the Sages, and the philosophical Fire represent the two practical aspects of the Great Work that circulate to form a single, powerful agent. This agent is the raw strength that overcomes all subtle and physical things, and it is the key to achieving the glory of the entire universe, which resides within the adept who masters it."
