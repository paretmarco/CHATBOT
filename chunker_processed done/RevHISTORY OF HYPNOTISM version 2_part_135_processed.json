  "title": "\"Discovering Somnambulism: Magnetic Healing at a Distance\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section describes the discovery of somnambulism by Puysegur. He found that people in magnetic sleep could be in contact with all of nature and react at a distance. Additionally, he experimented with a patient and found that he could feel sensations even when Puysegur wasn't touching him. These discoveries demonstrate the incredible ways in which magnetic sleep can affect the human body and mind. Prior to this, Mesmer had known about somnambulism but had rarely applied it.",
  "content": "Dans l’état de sommeil l’homme sent ses rapports avec toute la Nature – in the state of (magnetic) sleep the human being is in contact with all of Nature75 He also discovered that people in somnambulism could react at a distance. \"According to my usual practice,\" says Puysegur, \"I was magnetizing ... and after a quarter of an hour's attention and concentration on my part, and perfect tranquility on his, he told me that he felt nothing. As he had no complaint, this appeared to me quite natural. I however again pressed him between both my hands, merely to try whether I would be more successful; but he felt no more this second time than he had the first. I was at length about to leave him, when, on slowly removing my hand from his stomach, he fetched a sigh, and complained that I was hurting him. As I was not touching him, I could not at first believe it; but he hastily took my hand and lowered it, saying that it stopped his breath.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the practice of magnetism and mesmerism has shown that the state of (magnetic) sleep can put a person in contact with all of nature and that people in somnambulism can react to magnetic influence from a distance. These findings provide insight into the mysteries of the human brain and its connection to the world around us."
