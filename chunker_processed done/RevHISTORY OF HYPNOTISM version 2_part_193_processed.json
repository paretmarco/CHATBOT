  "title": "\"The Method of Deleuze: Examples of Cures and Experiences\"",
  "first_phrase": "The text speaks about the effectiveness of Deleuze’s method of healing through anecdotal evidence. Prior to the examples, the author suggests that one need not seek out the causes of the method's success, but can conduct oneself accordingly based on experience. One example tells of Oudin, paralyzed from the hips down, whose pains were relieved through the application of slight frictions applied by his wife. A second example details how Deleuze instructed a woman’s husband to relieve her severe pain, and upon visiting her, put her into a state of somnambulism through the touch of his hand on her shoulder.",
  "content": "Deleuze then told the woman to apply frictions along the reins, drawing towards the legs, and very soon the pains were entirely removed. Oudin was not cured of his paralysis, but he suffered no more; he could even make use of his legs, and he was infinitely better. 2d. a woman was confined to her bed by violent pains, attended with fever. deleuze went to see her, and perceiving she was very sensitive to the action of magnetism, he pointed out to her husband how he ought to proceed in order to relieve her. The benefit, which he at first produced, imparted confidence to him, and in fifteen days his wife was cured. She then came to thank Deleuze. He asked her if she still suffered pain; she replied, \" Only in the shoulder. When it was very severe, her husband caused it to pass away; but it returned, and he had not time every day to bestow care upon her.\" Deleuze then placed my hand upon her shoulder, and was much surprised to see her close her eyes; and, a few minutes after, fall into the state of somnambulism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these examples demonstrate the potential benefits of magnetism in alleviating physical pain, as seen in the cases of Oudin and the woman with fever. While further research is needed, it is worth exploring as a potential alternative or complementary treatment for pain management."
