  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the use of mesmerism and faith healing in 19th century India. Esdaile, a pioneering British surgeon, was introduced to the notion that stroking and breathing could cure diseases, known as the Jar-phoonk process. He observed several successful recoveries and realized its effectiveness in mesmeric processes. The last 200 tokens describe a mysterious healing ceremony performed by a Hindu mendicant devotee on a woman who had fallen ill after famine. Colonel Bagnold witnessed the ceremony, which involved invoking gods and making passes with sandal-wood beads while intermittently breathing and laying hands on her chest.",
  "content": "A ‘vergraggey' — mendicant devotee—offered to undertake her cure by performing a religious ceremony, or 'mundur'; and as the family lived in the same building with me and my military detachment, and had no objection to my being present, I attended. The man commenced with the usual Hindoo offerings, such as burning frankincense, breaking a cocoa-nut, and invoking some god, particularly Seetaram, and then seated the woman on the ground with her back and head against the wall, and took from his long matted hair a string of large sandal-wood beads, which he held up before her eyes and directed her to look at; then made passes with it from her head downwards, occasionally stopping to breathe upon or lay his hands upon her chest. She soon became drowsy, and appeared to sleep, when a handful of wood ashes were called for, waved over her head, thrown in the air, and the charm was pronounced complete. He then retired to a little distance and sat counting his beads, but with his eyes attentively fixed on her, and muttering as if in prayer. In about half an hour he started up, snapped his fingers, called out loudly ‘Seetaram!'",
  "last_phrase": "Despite initial doubts, the 'vergraggey' succeeded in curing the woman of her illness through a religious ceremony. Although viewed as trickery by the writer, the devotion and persistence of the 'vergraggey' cannot be denied. It is a reminder that different cultures have their ways of healing, which may be unfamiliar to us but can be effective."
