  "title": "\"Unlocking Personal Quantum Magnetism through Energetic Exercises and Self-Development\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, we explore the fascinating world of energy, consciousness, and the mysterious quantum magnetic effect. We learn about the relationship between energy and consciousness and how energy exercises can enhance personal magnetism, leading to an increased awareness field and greater self-reliance. The text also mentions the so-called \"quantum magnetic effect\" and how it can assist in solving problems and support the process of human evolution. The section highlights the work of F.A. Mesmer and his observations of the natural healing capacity that can be developed through a \"personal quantum magnetism.\" The section concludes by noting that even animals can feel this special energy.",
  "content": "And it is at this level that the so called “quantum magnetic effect” happen. In our school, we teach both methods of fascination and the so-called “methods of harmonious magnetism”. Such methods are capable of solving many problems and assist the process of man’s evolution. Already in his days, F.A. Mesmer had observed the existence in some persons of what approximated a natural therapeutic capacity, a fact which led him to strive to understand how the same results could be reproduced on an ongoing basis. He himself as he practiced as physician could observe a very strange effect: people bleeded differently as he approached to his patient. This was a stepping stone in his research. There is undoubtedly a natural healing capacity that can be developed. These abilities sometimes manifest simply because of the healer’s physical presence near the ill patient. It is exactly as if a special “personal quantum magnetism” could be at work in these moments. Even animals can feel it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, personal quantum magnetism is a natural healing capacity that can be developed through specific exercises and techniques. It can aid in solving many problems and assist in the process of human evolution. However, it is important to remember that regardless of the technique utilized, the healer's presence is the key to achieving successful results. So, it is essential to work on oneself and develop this ability to enhance energy levels and sensitivity."
