  "title": "\"The Theory and Practice of Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the power of movement in communicating with the body and providing relief from pain. Now, we delve deeper into this phenomenon and examine how magnetism can be used to restore balance and alleviate discomfort. These practices were utilized by ancient magnetizers and hypnotists and have been passed down through generations based on their effectiveness. Using passes and gaze, it is possible to alleviate pain in specific areas, including the head and shoulders. Magnetism appears to create equilibrium and restore balance in the body by chasing away what disturbs it.",
  "content": "If one has a pain in the shoulder, and the magnetizer makes passes from the shoulder to the end of the fingers, the pain will descend with the hand: it stops sometimes at the elbow, or at the wrist, and goes off by the hands, in which a slight perspiration is perceived: before it is entirely dissipated, a pain is sometimes felt in the lower part of the bowels. Magnetism seems to chase away and bear off with it what disturbs the equilibrium, and its action ceases when the equilibrium is restored. It is useless to search out the causes of these facts, it is sufficient that experience has established them, for us to conduct ourselves accordingly, when we have no reason to do otherwise. Deep states as executed by ancient magnetizers and hypnotists.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the causes of magnetism remain mysterious, its practical applications are well established. By directing the magnetic fluid, as adopted by the Marquis de Puysegur, one can alleviate pain and restore equilibrium in the body. While the theory of the universal fluid has undergone changes, the power of will and the ability to control its influence remains a significant part of this ancient practice."
