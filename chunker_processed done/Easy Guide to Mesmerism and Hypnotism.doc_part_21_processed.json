  "title": "\"The dangers of experimenting with Mesmerism and Hypnotism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier section of the text, the author condemns the unethical experimentation with hypnotism and mesmerism on hysterical and diseased patients. He mentions that the practice has been prevalent in continental hospitals and expresses his hope that it will not extend to his country. In the last 200 tokens, the text presents an interesting experiment conducted by Mr. Jules Volsin at the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. The experiment involved the study of the action of telepathic remedies, such as metals and magnets, on hysterical patients. The text narrates the methodology and findings of the experiment in detail.",
  "content": "The following extract from the Paris letter of The British Medical Journal, January 1, 1887, will be interesting to read in connection with the foregoing structures:â€” Mr. Jules Volsin has made two highly interesting experiments, at Salpetriere Hospital, on hysterical patients on whom he studied the action of telepathic remedies (medicamentia distance), such as metals and the magnet. He explained the phenomenon of various changes of personality presented by one of his patients, M. V., the same individual who was experimented on by MM. Bourru and Butot (See Congress of Grenoble, 1885, and Societe de Biology 1385). M. Voisin's experiments were made with corked and sealed phials of an opaque colour. He was himself ignorant of the contents of these phials, and was careful not to utter a word in the patient's presence. He threw the subject into a lethargic, somnolent and cataleptic state, but obtained no result under these conditions. When M. Voisin made his experiments on any patient in a waking state, the latter immediately fell into a hypnotic state and exhibited symptoms of disturbance, nausea and vomiting.",
  "last_phrase": "These experiments conducted by M. Jules Voisin at Salpetriere Hospital provide valuable insights into the possible effects of telepathic remedies on hysterical patients. The results of these experiments suggest that the use of metal and magnet in a hypnotic state can have a significant physiological impact on patients. These findings could potentially lead to new treatment options for those suffering from hysteria or similar conditions."
