He associated each symbol with a different aptitude and personal history. In this last part, we will explore the six main deviations and types of personalities that arise from unbalance and fear. We will also learn how to act with magnetism with each type, including the Realizer, Dreamer, and Pacific/Adapter. The section concludes with a mirror exercise to help the Pacific/Adapter type.",
