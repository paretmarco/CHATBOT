  "title": "The Three Principles in Hermetic Philosophy.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the concept of uniting Sulphur to Mercury to create the Universal Medicine of the hermetic philosophers is explored. This union is the result of multiple operations to obtain the Sulphur and Mercury separately. The text further explains that the primordial Light emanates from within and without and is centripetal and universally penetrating, termed as Mercury in Hermetism. The central idea of unity in multiplicity and the omnipresence of the infinite source of existence is discussed. The text also delves into the idea of stabilisation and condensation.",
  "content": "In every individual, irrespective of which kingdom they come from, the universal Light is manifested like a hearth of expansive energy. It allows an internal fire to burn inside us, maintained by that which Alchemists call Sulphur F. This Fire of life, which is inherent to every organic cell and also to every mineral atom, spreads its rays infinitely, such that a luminous radiation is given off by all individualised beings and diffused through space. This new aspect of the Light, which is singular in its essence, in Hermetism takes the name of Mercury because, in the same way that the metal infiltrates organic bodies through the pores and tends to penetrate to their very centre, this ambient Light is recognised to be centripetal and universally penetrating. But there is a distinction between the luminous rays that spread either from within or from without (Sulphur F) and those that start from within and then become concentrated on every emitting centre (Mercury ). But how can we speak of within and without, without conceiving of some intermediate content, a limit where the opposing rays balance against one another, and by way of this stabilisation, become condensed?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the universal Light manifests itself in every living and non-living being, giving rise to three principles - Sulphur F, Mercury, and Salt - that are necessary for everything that exists. The Azoth of the Sages is the active form of Mercury, symbolizing the animating force of all things and the beginning and end of creation. Understanding these principles can help us better comprehend the interconnectedness of all things and the fundamental forces that govern the universe."
