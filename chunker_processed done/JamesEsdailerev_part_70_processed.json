  "title": "\"The Mesmeric Experiments of Mr. Esdaile in India\"",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text focuses on James Esdaile, a surgeon and a pioneer in mesmerism in India. After retiring from the British East India Company, Esdaile settles in Scotland to record his observations and experiences in mesmerism. He eventually moved to Sydenham and passed away in 1859. In this section, Esdaile describes his first mesmerism experiment on a Hindu man with a double hydrocele, which turned out to be successful even without prior experience or knowledge on the subject.",
  "content": "On the 4th of April, 1845, a Hindoo of the lowest caste was brought to the hospital with a double hydrocele. The water was drawn off one side of the scrotum, and two drachma of the usual corrosive sublimate injection thrown in. On feeling the pain from the injection, the man threw his head over the back of the chair, and pressed his hands firmly upon his groins, making the grimaces of a person in pain. Seeing him suffering in this way, it occurred to me to attempt to mesmerise him; and turning to my native assistant, I asked him if he had ever seen a person mesmerised. He said that he had seen it attempted at the Calcutta Medical College, but without success. ‘I have a -great mind to try it on this man,` I said, ‘but as I never saw it done, I shall probably not succeed.' Without a word said to the man, his eyes being still closed, I began to make passes from the crown of his head to the pit of his stomach without touching him. I continued this for half an hour, and then gave it up in despair, seeing no sensible effect.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism may have played a role in the unexpected and miraculous recovery of the Hindoo patient with a double hydrocele, highlighting the incredible power of the mind-body connection that science is yet to fully comprehend."
