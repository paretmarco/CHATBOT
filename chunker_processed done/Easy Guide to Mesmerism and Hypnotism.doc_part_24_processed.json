  "title": "\"The Theory of Suggestion and Hypnotism: Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author discusses the changes in personality observed during hysterical attacks and somnambulism. The experiments conducted aim to support the theory of suggestion or hypnotism, as opposed to animal magnetism. The author acknowledges the influence of weariness, suggestion, and imagination in hypnotism, but cautions against inexperienced and unscrupulous operators. The final 200 tokens express the author's belief in the noble calling of hypnotism and mesmerism to alleviate pain and suffering without drugs or surgery, while emphasizing the need for caution and responsible practice. The text concludes by inviting readers to form their own opinions and examine the subject carefully.",
  "content": "These powers then, which medical men and others are beginning to realise can be exercised effectively, and with good and evil results, should as far as possible be kept out of the hands of inexperienced novices and unscrupulous operators. Whether this can be done, legally or otherwise, it is difficult to say. The best course for all who read this book, is to be careful, “How to mesmerize and by whom they are mesmerized.” To alleviate pain and suffering, to cure others of diseases and ailments without drugs or the surgeon's knife, is to engage in work evoking the keenest human sympathy. Here is one of the noblest callings to which human kind can devote its energies—a work of sympathy, love and devotion to our fellow mortals and that science is Mesmerism and Hypnotism; by its influence you can cure diseases and extend powerful influence over the mind of others without their knowledge. This book is now left to tell its own tale and, with all its faults, it may repay careful perusal.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of mesmerism and hypnotism can bring effective results, but it is essential to be cautious about who performs it. Mesmerism has the potential to cure diseases and alleviate suffering, and it is a noble calling to dedicate oneself to. The life of F.A. Mesmer reminds us of the importance of exploring new methods to improve health care continually."
