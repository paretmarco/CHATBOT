  "title": "\"The Philosophy and Practices of Mesmerism by Esdaile\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed James Esdaile's use of Mesmerism as a healing agent. In this section, the author highlights Esdaile's philosophical curiosity about the communication of human minds with other minds, quoting Lord Bacon's perspective. Esdaile had limited experience with mesmerising healthy subjects, and he believed that Mesmerism had no dangers if not used excessively. The author further notes Esdaile's comparative silence on the dangers of Mesmerism, unlike other medical men who devote a whole chapter to the subject. Esdaile mentions only one possible accident where subjects may not regain their sight after being awakened from Mesmerism-induced sleep.",
  "content": "And again:- \"The practical rule is, never to mesmerise anyone except for medical purposes, and not to do more than is necessary for the cure of disease. If this is acted up to, I am not aware that Mesmerism has any dangers whatever.\" Of the dangers of Mesmerism Esdaile says comparative little for a medical man; for we generally find a whole chapter on \"The Dangers of Hypnotism or Mesmerism\" in the works on the subject by medical men, a chapter which is apparently intended to act as a sign-board to warn off lay trespassers on their domain.33 Of one possible accident, he says:- \"Sometimes it happens that the subjects on being awakened open their eyes, and at the same moment recover all their faculties; but it is seen that the pupil is insensible to light; this they also become aware of; they know that their eyes are open, and that they ought to see, but do not.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while there may be some potential dangers associated with Mesmerism, as long as it is used for medical purposes and minimally necessary for the cure of disease, these risks can be greatly mitigated. Furthermore, proper caution and adherence to safe practices, such as avoiding prolonged gazing and passes, can help minimize any potential harm to the patient."
