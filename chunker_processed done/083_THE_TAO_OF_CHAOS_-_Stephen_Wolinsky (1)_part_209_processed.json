  "title": "\"Finding Your Essence: Self-Therapy for Inner Awareness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of the \"Essence\" and where it can be found, as suggested by a story about gods deciding where to hide it. The answer was found within people themselves. The Self-Therapy presented here encourages individuals to explore their own emptiness and identify the I-dentities that defend against it. By feeling and experiencing the qualities of these identities within the emptiness, one can find their true essence. This therapy requires honesty and introspection, as well as a willingness to look beyond the superficial and search within oneself.",
  "content": "This requires us all to be impeccably honest with ourselves and to notice the gnawing emptiness within our own body which the body and the observer/personality dyad have organized around. To do this, the inadequacy must be explored. The individual will have numerous over-compensating I-dentities that defend against the experience of the emptiness. The Therapy Write down those I-dentities which resist your emptiness. Notice where in your body emptiness exists. Enter into the emptiness and feel it. Notice how to the I-dentity, the emptiness seems like death, but from the inside, the emptiness is calm, quiet, peaceful and serene. From inside the emptiness ask each Identity \"What is it you really want and are seeking more than anything else in the world?\" However the I-dentity responds, feel that quality of experience in the spacious emptiness. Next, have the I-dentities turn around and be reabsorbed within the emptiness which is Essence. Seeing the I-dentities in the foreground, stay in the background and notice the Identities are floating in emptiness. Experience and feel the essential quality from the background. See the I-dentities and the emptiness as being made of the same substance.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to overcome the gnawing emptiness within ourselves, we must acknowledge and explore our inadequacy through various over-compensating identities that defend against the experience of emptiness. By feeling the fear and acknowledging the truth within ourselves, we can move towards a more peaceful and serene state of being. This process of self-discovery and acceptance may be uncomfortable, but it is essential for personal growth and healing."
