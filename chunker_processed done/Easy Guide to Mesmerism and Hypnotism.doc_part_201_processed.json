  "title": "\"The Power of Mesmerism: Turning Defeat into Victory\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author shares a story of how he turned a potential defeat into victory with some coolness and tact. He tells the story of a fox who spoke to a group of hounds who were out hunting him, expressing his views on the matter. In the end, the author prevails and is complimented by a committee of gentlemen. In this final section, the author provides insights into the nature of people, and how human beings can be influenced even when they feel they are acting against their innate sense of fair play. The text touches on the power of persuasion and how it can be used to change perspectives. It also briefly mentions the phenomenon that the committee observed and commented on.",
  "content": "The fox addressed the hounds courteously, between puffs thus—‘Gentlemen, what are you after?’ ‘We are out for a day's fun said the puppy who led the hounds.’ “Well, then, gentlemen, said the fox, “it may be fun to you, but it is death to me.” I tell the Aesopian story badly, but the effect was magical. The people applauded, and the students sang “For he's a jolly good fellow,” and gave me no more trouble that evening or during my stay. I turned my apparent defeat that night into a victory by a little coolness and tact. I asked the students and the audience to appoint a committee of six gentlemen—three medical and three nonmedical—to represent them on the platform, and keenly watch the experiments. This was done. At the close, the committee reported entired satisfaction with all that they had seen. They critically examined the subjects, and were perfectly satisfied with the genuineness of the phenomena which occurred through them. They also complimented me in no stinted manner; and no wonder.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of coolness and tact in difficult situations cannot be overstated. By overcoming opposition and winning over skeptics, we can turn apparent defeats into victories. These lessons can be applied not only in mesmerism but in everyday life."
