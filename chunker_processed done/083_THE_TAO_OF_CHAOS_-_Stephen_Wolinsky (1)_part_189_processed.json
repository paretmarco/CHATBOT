  "title": "\"The Trauma of Losing Essence: Understanding the Double-bind of Personality\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, \"The Loss of Essence\" was explored, discussing how the trauma of separation of the personality from its Essence results in the defense mechanisms that dissociate the personality from the essence repeatedly. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the text discusses the fear of the self and the chaos of energy experienced by those who have undergone the traumatic fragmentation process. The text also touches on David Bohm's implicate and explicate orders and how Essence acts as a touchstone or bridge between the ultimate and physical universe, giving order to chaos. The paradox is that the personality sees the empty space of Essence as chaos. This predicament is illustrated by the fairy tale \"The Ugly Duckling,\" in which the ugly duckling becomes a beautiful swan.",
  "content": "The predicament of personality is illustrated in the fairy tale, The Ugly Duckling. The ugly duckling is treated as ugly by the outer world, thinks it's ugly, until it realizes, when it looks at itself, it is a beautiful swan (Essence). In physics terms, Essence is the second implicate; it exists outside of energy, space, mass, and time, and yet acts as the touchstone or bridge which connects the ultimate to the physical universe. In other words, it is Essence that stands 150 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS between David Bohm's implicate and explicate orders. Moreover, it is Essence that can give order to chaos. The paradox, however, is that to the I-dentities of personality, the empty space of Essence seems like chaos. Personality is the accumulation of I-dentities arranged so as to support the biological and psycho-emotional survival of the physical body. This puts I-dentities in a frozen pattern; I-dentities of personality are frozen trying to order outward chaos, and frozen resisting the perceived inward chaos of emptiness. In this way, the Identities of personality are in a double-bind stuck between outward and inward chaos.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the predicament of personality and the role of Essence can help us gain insight into the paradoxical nature of our lives. By recognizing the frozen identities of our personality, we can learn to access the transformative power of Essence to reorder and bring harmony to the chaos of our inner and outer worlds. With this understanding, we can embrace the fullness of our being and live in alignment with our true nature."
