  "title": "What are the potential effects of Mesmerism on the human body and how can medical professionals test it?",
  "first_phrase": "This passage explores the effects of mesmerism on the body, including symptoms such as sleep-walking, delirium, and convulsions. The author, John Elliotson, advocates for medical practitioners to experiment with mesmerism on their own patients to better understand and utilize its benefits. In the final 200 tokens, Elliotson encourages his fellow medical professionals to put aside their skepticism and misconceptions and conduct personal experiments, as he himself has previously done without adverse effects. He argues that this is the best way to understand and harness the potential benefits of mesmerism for their patients.",
  "content": "The finest as well as the most striking phenomena will then be equally diagnostic to their practiced eyes, and their understandings will be left clear and free to study and imitate the curative processes of Nature, undisturbed by doubts and suspicions regarding the powers of observation and the honesty of others.\" Again:- \"It is by medical men in the country taking up the subject experimentally, without previous knowledge of it, and having no theories to make good or defend, that the truth or falsehood of Mesmerism may be very speedily decided.\" And again:- \"Instead of sneering and dogmatising about Mesmerism, I would earnestly entreat my medical brethren to put it to the test of personal experiment; for it is a thing to be done, and not talked of merely.\" He encourages his professional brethren thus:- \"I have never seen, nor have any of my acquaintance ever seen, any bad effect accompany or follow operations performed during the magnetic sleep, of which the influence is essentially strengthening instead of being depressing. It fortifies the patient for the operation, secures him from pain during its performance, and facilitates his recovery, inasmuch as it admits of the wound being dressed without pain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of Mesmerism in the medical field has continued to be a subject of debate, but there is much potential for its practical application in various areas of medicine, including surgery, pain management, and therapy for mental health conditions. It is essential for medical professionals to conduct personal experiments and embrace the opportunity to explore the curative processes of nature, undisturbed by doubts and skepticism, in order to determine the full extent of Mesmerism's benefits."
