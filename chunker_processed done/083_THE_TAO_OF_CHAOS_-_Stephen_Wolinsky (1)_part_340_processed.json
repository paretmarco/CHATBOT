  "title": "\"The Importance of Attention and Internal Energy in Human Interaction\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the concept of attention's demand and its various forms. Continuing on this, Idries Shah's idea that internal images, thoughts, and emotions demand attention is explored in this section. We learn that an observer's thoughts, emotions, and excess energy bound up in a trauma seek attention. The author suggests experimenting with attention exercises and highlights the link between attention and knowledge creation by an observer. The section is a continuation of the previous discussion's theme of attention and its complexities.",
  "content": "(Reflections: Fables in the Sufi Tradition, Idries Shah, Penguin Books, Inc., Maryland, 1971, p.14) What Shah is suggesting here is that an internal image, thought or emotion is an alive energy that wants attention. For example, if the observer fixates on a trauma and the energy is not released, the observer probably will create a trance such as dissociating or negative hallucination to \"not see\" the trauma. The thoughts, emotions, images, and excess energy bound up in the trauma seek the attention of an observer. For that reason experiment with the following exercises. Notice with each circumstance if there is a giving, receiving or exchanging of attention. r THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 283 which means that the observer has knowledge about what it creates. For example, an observer creates the thought, \"I like myself' and the observer also knows the thought \"I like myself' and what it is and means. In this way the observer is also a knower, or better said, the observer possesses the knowledge of what it creates. The knower is the knowing at the level of Essence in Quantum Consciousness: Volume I.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, by recognizing the alive energy that thoughts, emotions, and images carry, we can explore our consciousness further. Through the exercises mentioned, we can identify the giving, receiving, or exchanging of attention in various circumstances. By understanding that the observer and the observed are one, we take a quantum leap in our understanding of experience. This knowledge can help us navigate our lives with greater awareness and consciousness."
