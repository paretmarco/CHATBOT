  "content": "Improving our natural gift Although it is a very natural gift, it can be improved and learnt if a person wishes to do so. The ancient records of magnetism show us that starting from the first simple cures, it can be developed until we reach very advanced results: the so- called ‘higher magnetic phenomena’. These phenomena launched the beginning of all parapsychological research as well as the advanced system of philosophy such as that of Schopenauer. This opens the path to the so-called ‘experimental magnetism’, where effects that are difficult to explain can happen. It is a space where we can develop our intuition and achieve very specific states of consciousness. Healing Healing is the field where results can be achieved from the very first moment. Historically, animal Magnetism or Mesmerism evolved and both have become the basis of magnetic healing therapies and of a series of practices which are very diffused throughout Europe. A number of elements of each split, and gave rise to the advent of Modern, or Suggestive healing Hypnotism. This latter discipline, Hypnotism, is mostly used for psychological/emotional problems. It could greatly improve when connected again to its source, animal magnetism.",
