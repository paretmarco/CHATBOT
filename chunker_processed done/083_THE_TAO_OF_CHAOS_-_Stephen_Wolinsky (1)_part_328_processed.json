The importance of seeing emotions as energy is also highlighted.",

Therapist: Where do you feel the confusion in your body? Client: In my face. Therapist: Create the confusion in your face. Client: I can't create it, it is already there. Therapist: Okay, make a xerox copy of the confusion. Client: Okay. Therapist: Make three more xerox copies of the confusion. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now, let go of the copies. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now notice the shape of the confusion. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now merge with the confusion 100 percent. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now intentionally choose for the confusion to be there.
