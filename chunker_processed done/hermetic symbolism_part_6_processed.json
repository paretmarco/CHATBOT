  "title": "\"Basic Notions of Hermeticism: An Overview of Alchemy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the complex reality of Hermeticism and the French School of Alchemy. In the previous section, the author discusses their experiences in therapeutic magnetism and introduces the Philosophers’ Medicine. In the final part, they bring together all they have written about alchemy. While the approach is not methodical, the author believes that readers will benefit from putting together the facts presented. The editor in chief of L’Acacia explains that the author, brother Wirth, is the head of the Masonic School of Alchemy, a powerful group in France in the past.",
  "content": "Allow us to reproduce here the page dedicated to us by the editor in chief of L’Acacia, our friend C. M. Limosin, in his posthumously published article written for the journal: “…brother Wirth is, within the Masons, the head of a school which in other times, in France and other countries, was powerful: The School of Alchemy. “The Masonic School of Alchemy is the French school, completely separate from the English school. In the 18th century French practitioners of masonry, influenced by factors that need not be discussed here, began to practice the occult sciences: magic, Kabbala, astrology, magnetism, and above all alchemy. Just reading one of Wirth’s articles is sufficient to recognise the alchemist in him. I do not mean to disparage him by saying this: on the contrary, I see him as the representative of a noble tradition. Alchemy is not, and never has been, that which the uneducated masses think it is. It was something like that, but also something more.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the French Masonic School of Alchemy, headed by Brother Wirth, represents a noble tradition that goes beyond the mere transmutation of metals. It was a general scientific system that has influenced the modern science of chemistry, with a rich nomenclature that we still use today."
