I'M O.K. IF I FEEL PAIN, YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU FEEL PAIN T his Fixation of Attention Strategy #4 represents in psychology's character analysis the masochist. A masochist is some- one who feels that the only way to get love and control a situation is to feel pain. In character analysis, the masochist feels control through pain. In this structure there is a confusion between pain and love. Simply stated, love= pain.

By retrieving our lost Essence and reabsorbing it back into ourselves, we can break free from the confusion between pain and love, and begin to establish healthy connections to ourselves, our lives, and our roots."
