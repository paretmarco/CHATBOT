  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Reabsorption of I-dentities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author, who has written four books previously, focuses on reabsorbing old identity patterns. The text also highlights that identities are connected, and each identity has a counter-identity forming a unit that complements one another. The text includes case studies that demonstrate both easy and difficult reabsorption processes, and the author emphasizes that this process is not a formula, but a context to enter into the reabsorption of old identity patterns. To provide context, the text also notes the author's previous works, which demonstrate that life reflects the world of physics, and identities have counter-identities, reflecting the world of physics and our inner world of psychology.",
  "content": "For that reason, each case and its complexity of therapeutic information will increase as you go along. This gives the reader a piece at a time. This process is not a formula, but THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 155 rather a context to enter into the reabsorption of old I-dentity patterns. Throughout all of my four books I have demonstrated that life, and our intrapsychic world, reflect the world of physics. I-dentities have counter I-dentities, which are one unit working in tandem and complementing one another. These Identities are connected, and, unlike most forms of psychotherapy where we try to get rid of the bad worthless part and keep the good worthy part, in the therapy of chaos both are seen as a unit connected by an emotional state or a trance which holds the I-dentity together like glue. These pairs of I-dentities are reflected in the world of physics and hence in our inner world of psychology. \"Today we know that every particle has its antiparticle, Particle and antiparticle is a fundamental symmetry in physics...Scientists realized that an electron can be thought of as having a quantized spin. This spin has only one of two possible directions - up or down- hence its basic two-valuedness.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy of chaos recognizes that our inner world of psychology reflects the world of physics, where counter I-dentities work in tandem and complement one another. Understanding the pairs of I-dentities formed to organize chaos and the resistance to chaos is crucial in facilitating an I-dentity on a search to end unpleasant states."
