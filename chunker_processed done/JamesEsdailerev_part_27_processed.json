  "first_phrase": "In this part of the text, the author discusses how to re-access the hypnosis state and terminate the trance. Before this, the author suggests using hand levitation to acquire more mobility and gradually raising your tone to bring the subject even deeper. The author then explains how to anchor the state for future usage by associating it with a trigger like passing a hand in front of the subject's eyes. Finally, the author recommends counting from 1 to 10 to terminate the trance.",
  "content": "Tell the subject: “Whenever you and I want to do hypnosis together in the future, all I will have to do is pass my hand down in front of your eyes and I will say the word _______ at which time your eyes will close, and you will enter a level of hypnosis much deeper than the one you are in now” As you see the trigger for the anchor is here the action of passing your hand in front of the subject’s eyes in conjunction with one word you speak out, the one you put in _____.

  "last_phrase": "Using an anchor like the trigger word you choose creates a powerful tool for deepening hypnosis in future sessions. To ensure a safe and effective trance termination, a slow countdown from 1 to 10 is recommended, giving your subject the time needed to return to consciousness fully. Remember to assure your subject that they will be completely awake and refreshed when counting to 5 to avoid any risks on their journey home."
