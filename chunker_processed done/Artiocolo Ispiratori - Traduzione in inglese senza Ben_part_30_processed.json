  "title": "\"Cervical Plexus Exercise for Energy and Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we discussed the certificate of doctorate in medicine awarded to Maitre Philippe and explored the possibilities and benefits of magnetism. In this final 200 tokens, we delve deeper into some practices of Baron du Potet Plexus, a prominent figure in magnetism. We learn about recharging the cervical plexus using visualization techniques that involve focusing on a red point, imagining energy surging from the solar plexus, and mentally covering the path of two imaginary threads for a few minutes. It is believed that such exercises can help practitioners restore energy and bring well-being to others.",
  "content": "Place yourselves in a cross-legged position in front of a mirror (A wardrobe mirror would be excellent). You will have drawn beforehand a red point by the exact spot on which the image of the cervical plexus falls. Whilst your eyes are shut, and your whole body is relaxed, breathe slowly and deeply. Open your eyes. Look at the red point which symbolizes the cervical plexus. Let a feeling of emptiness pervade your head. Imagine a source of energy surging within the solar plexus. Two threads spread out from there: One of them follows the spinal column inwardly, whereas the other moves frontally under the thorax, the throat and the face. The said two imaginary threads reach an immaterial point by the cervical plexus. Mentally cover this “itinerary” more than once, for a two minutes’ period, by climbing up from the front. During such time, keep on staring at the red point.",
  "last_phrase": "With enough practice, you will be able to accumulate a powerful energy within you that can be directed outward. Take the time to perform this exercise every day and soon you will feel a strong sensation of heat and intensity at the cervical plexus, allowing you to tap into a reserve of energy that you never knew existed."
