  "title": "\"The Persecution and Triumph of Mesmer: A Story of Controversial Doctrine and Personal Power\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text portrays the remarkable life of Mesmer, the 18th-century physician who claimed to have discovered a universal cure for all illnesses. In the first part, we saw how his novel doctrine was met with rejection by knowledgeable bodies, who refused to examine it. In the last 200 tokens, we witness Mesmer's response to this rejection: he retreated to Lake Constance to reconnect with nature and gain insight into natural knowledge. Guided by his belief that language and reasoning posed barriers to accessing natural power, he went through rigorous exercises, avoiding inner dialogue for three consecutive months.",
  "content": "In the course of nearly four years, while the said dogged fight was going on, Mesmer, with unparalleled cynicism, was mocked, insulted, vilified, and turned into a caricature, into a song, a target of ludicrous embodiment of venality, arrogance and disloyalty, in spite or rather because of the successes he had reaped throughout the world, as well as the warm protection he had received from the queen, not to mention the governmentâ€™s tacit approval. He triumphed over such intrigue in an indirect manner, Having temporarily retired, he returned to Lake Constance after the days he had spent therein in his childhood. He returned to Nature and strove to get as far as he could to the bottom of natural knowledge. Guided by his belief that language and reasoning prevented man from gaining instinctive access to the foundation of his natural power, he went through an intense exercise, steering clear of inner dialogue for a period of three consecutive months.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmer's triumphant journey was filled with relentless persecution, yet he never relented. He overcame the overwhelming opposition, retired to nature, and came back with an even greater magnetic power, which garnered the support and admiration of the noblewomen in Paris. His story shows us that persistence, knowledge, and personal qualities are key tools for achieving success."
