  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the author describes the concept of the \"all-powerful whole\" and how it relates to the biology of stem cells and the quantic superposition. The white light is an example of an \"all-powerful whole\" as it contains all colors within it. The author goes on to explain how the direct perception of wisdom and the sixth sense helps us to access the \"angel's level.\" In this final section, the author discusses the need to develop the \"sixth sense\" and the \"ears of the heart\" to access the clairvoyance and clairaudience for direct action. This is a reintegration of a subsensoriality that was linked to by ancient cultures.",
  "content": "That is the case, for example, of the Pygmies in Africa and the Parsis. Exercise Clairvoyance ? - Look the reflex of the light in the mirror (polarized light) - Stay in front of mirror - Think about a person that you know - Where is this person? - Stay in this passive way Clairaudience In order to access this, it is thus necessary to develop the “sixth sense”, i.e. the direct perception of wisdom (as well as the so-called “angel’s level”). Listening to direct wisdom is what tells one how to operate within reality. These are the “ears of the heart” from which the direct action originates. This also is the reintegration of a subsensoriality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing our sixth sense is not only possible but can be achieved through exercises such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, and the Chinese Pi Quan method. By practicing these techniques, we can gain direct perception of wisdom and operate within reality with a deeper understanding."
