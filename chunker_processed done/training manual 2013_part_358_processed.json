  "title": "\"The Path to Human Wellbeing: Reintegration of All Faculties\"",
  "first_phrase": "This is the final part of a book discussing the process of reintegration of all faculties. The preceding text describes how everyday life is filled with microtrances where attention and consciousness shrink, limiting our perception of reality. In contrast, techniques such as integral breathing and Chinese inner alchemy can facilitate the reintegration process by increasing sensitivity to imperceptible movements within the body, leading to a heightened state of awareness. Through these exercises, individuals can detach from programmed time and gain a better understanding of the concept of Unicam Medicinam, or \"the only medicine\". The text concludes with a discussion of the word Vitriolum, its meaning, and its relationship to the reintegration process.",
  "content": "By virtue of such exercises, we additionally detach ourselves from programmed time and we enter the sphere of connected time. In that manner, we gain a better understanding of the two final letters in the word VITRIOLUM : Unicam Medicinam, i.e. “the only medicine”. General Survey - The reintegration of all the faculties The daily life of a person is punctuated by a series of quotidian microtrances, that is, instances where the fields of attention and consciousness shrink down, as such contractions thereof diminish the possible perception of reality. It is these shrinkages that, in actual fact, “swallow up time” and prevent us from living in the now. What we define as “trance” is a process of reduction of reality. If we were to depict the whole of reality through a circle F?? ?, every microtrance would be seen as engendering a reduction of such totality, which is symbolized by the symbol (moon) denoting the fact that we only perceive one part, a mere reflection, of such global reality.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing exercises that allow us to detach from programmed time and enter the sphere of connected time, we gain a better understanding of ourselves and reality. The path to human wellbeing lies in the reintegration of all faculties, which allows us to fully embrace our potential and experience true happiness."
