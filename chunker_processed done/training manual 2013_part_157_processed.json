  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, you learned about a breathing exercise aimed at relaxing muscles and improving posture. In this last part, the text focuses on the correct way to execute the exercise while maintaining a steady gaze and emphasizing specific parts of a mental sentence. The exercise helps reduce the size of the hips and expand the diaphragm, improving shape, and breathing capacity. The text also advises against straining muscles or causing discomfort while holding the breath.",
  "content": "It will reduce those heavy bay windows of the three-hundred-pounder, and also round out the wasp-shaped funnel. To avoid all possibility of suggestive ideas of a drifting nature, you emphasize one word of the sentence at a time. While inhaling, put special emphasis upon \"Breath,\" while \"is Life\" is not to be emphasized. Bend forward while inhaling until you have reached a point where the floating ribs almost come in contact with the lower limbs. Of course, you must remember that your abdomen is to be drawn in gently in all the exercises. As soon as you are through inhaling and bending forward, which is to be done very slowly and gently, you retain the breath, or hold it, as it were, while repeating the sentence, \"Breath is Life,\" with emphasis on \"is.\" You are not to choke yourself while retaining breath. Do not strain the muscles of the larynx or the chest, but stop inhaling and remain in the position as if intending to inhale longer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing this breathing exercise can help reduce the weight of heavy bay windows and round out the shape of your body. Remember to emphasize the word \"Breath\" while inhaling and \"Life\" while exhaling. Perform the exercise slowly, carefully and for not more than three minutes, up to three times a day."
