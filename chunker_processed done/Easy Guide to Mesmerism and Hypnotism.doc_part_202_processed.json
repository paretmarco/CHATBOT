  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, the author shares his victory in a mesmerism demonstration through coolness and tact. He appointed a committee of attendees to validate the experiments and they reported entirely satisfied with what they saw. The author then proceeds to describe one of the experiments involving his control over arterial circulation. He caused the pulse to beat at different rates on each arm, and this strange phenomenon was validated by two medical professionals. It is a great example of the author's mesmerism power.",
  "content": "The opposition I met with that night and the determination to bring the whole to a happy issue seemed to arouse in me all my energies, for it was certainly one of most complete exhibitions of mesmeric power I ever gave. These experiments, out of many, will serve as an illustration of what took place. In the first—with a Glasgow sensitive—I exhibited my complete control over the arterial circulation. Thus, while the subject stood placidly between two medical men, each holding a wrist and carefully taking the pulse indications, etc accelerated or retarded the action of the heart at will. Strange as this may appear, stranger must follow. I caused the pulse to reach 120 or 130 per minute on the right arm, and it beat less than 50 per minute on the left, and vice-versa. This can he explained on two grounds: either the subject was mesmerised by me, and the phenomena, as described, did occur (as testified to by these medical men at the time), or the medical men themselves were mesmerised by me, and, under my guidance, hypnotically declared what was false to he true.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these mesmeric experiments serve as a testament to the power of suggestion and the fascinating effects it can have on the human body. While the exact cause of these phenomena may remain a topic of debate, it is clear that the results were both intriguing and impressive, leaving us with a glimpse into the mysteries of the human mind and body."
