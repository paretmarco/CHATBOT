  "title": "The History of Animal Magnetism and Hypnotism",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, we'll explore how the study of Animal Magnetism evolved into Electro-Biology and Hypnotism. Initially, the phenomena were considered to be due to some magnetic force or influence peculiar to living beings. However, American lecturers introduced Electro-Biology, attributing the phenomena to electrical currents generated in the body. The concept of Clairvoyants, Odylic Force, and Hypnotism are also discussed. The history of these phenomena reveals that many have investigated them as quacks and charlatans, but recent studies have brought it into the domain of exact science.",
  "content": "Editor's note: Coates even distinguishes Hypnotism from Animal Magnetism: this is very important as today animal magnetism is no longer practised and it is something completely different from “hypnotism.” HISTORY — It was natural that the apparent power of influencing the bodies and minds of others should attract much attention and be eagerly sought after for purposes of gain, or from a love of the marvellous, or for the cure of diseases. Hence we find that, whilst not a few have investigated these phenomena in a scientific spirit, more have done so as Quacks, and Charlatans who have thrown discredit on a department of the physiology of man of the deepest interest. Recently, however, as will be shown in this article, physiologists and physicians have set about investigating the subjects in such a manner as to bring it into the domain of exact science, and to dispel the idea that the phenomena are due either to any occult force or to supernatural agency. It would appear that in all ages, diseases were alleged to be affected by the touch of the hand of certain persons, who were supposed to communicate a healing virtue to the sufferer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the history of hypnosis and animal magnetism is a tale of curiosity, quackery, and eventually scientific inquiry. While it is no longer believed to be due to supernatural forces, the power of suggestion and touch still hold great potential for healing and well-being in modern times."
