  "content": "Mesmer.40 “Magnetizers have given the name of crises to the remarkable changes which the action of magnetism produces upon those who are subjected to it, or to that state which is different from the natural one, into which they are thrown by its influence” Deleuze In favourable cases, magnetic procedures will produce results almost immediately. A specific technique of Mesmer is to create a crisis. The patient will undergo a \"crisis\" after which he will rapidly recover. The word crisis means a change in the being of the person with which we work. So we will have different types of crises. For example the “magnetic sleep”, where a person remains completely quiet and self absorbed is a crisis. “Here I ought to observe, that the magnetic sleep is of itself essentially restorative. During this sleep, nature works unassisted; and it is often sufficient to re-establish the equilibrium, and to cure nervous complaints”41. Somnambulism is another type of crisis and the ecstatic state still another. The most intense crises are the convulsions. These are very impressive. In reality these should be realized only when needed.",
