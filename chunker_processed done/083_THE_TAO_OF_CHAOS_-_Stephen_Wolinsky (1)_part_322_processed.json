  "title": "\"Traumas and Trances: Understanding the Defensive Mechanisms\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between trauma, trances, and self-discovery. In the first part of the text, the role of trauma as a foundation for defensive trances is explained. It is emphasized that to fully understand oneself, it is necessary to recognize and process one's trances. The last 200 tokens focus on a visual illustration of the defensive trances around a trauma and how to proceed safely in processing them. The example of a little girl who experienced molestation is given to illustrate the order of unlearning, with the last learned being the first unlearned. This approach is necessary to process the trances and eventually reabsorb the identities into essence.",
  "content": "For example, if a little girl was molested at age 5, she might first, dissociate; second, numb-out; and third, hypnotic ________________ dream in order to survive the trauma. The order of unlearning is different for each person, because what we unlearn first is what is learned last... therefore you proceed by stages, the last learned is the first unlearned, and in this way you can proceed safely. (G. Spencer Brown Transcripts, Professor Von Meier, Art 269, March 19, 1973) In this way, she will pass through the trances in a last in, first out fashion. Or, the last trance created being the first trance that will have to be experienced as we go into the trauma. In the above situation, she will first have to go through hypnotic dreaming. It seems like a dream, second, sensory distortion (numbing out), and third, dissociation (floating above her body). These trances must be experienced and processed as created defenses in order to enter into the actual event. The event itself must be \"looked at\" and processed before the Identities can be re-absorbed into Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, processing through the trances in a safe and deliberate manner is essential for those who have experienced trauma, and seeking the guidance of a qualified therapist may be necessary. The journey of healing can be challenging, but with willingness, understanding, and honesty, it is possible to reabsorb identities into essence and move towards a healthier state of being."
