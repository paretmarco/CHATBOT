  "title": "\"Concentration Exercises for Improved Focus\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored exercises that helped individuals concentrate on specific sensations and discard distractions, as they mastered the ability to focus their attention. These exercises, which start in solitude but gradually take place amidst people and noise, were designed by J. Krishnamurti, and they've been known to improve mental agility. In exercise 20, we learn about the needle exercise, where participants must follow a needle pushed through the center of a book page.",
  "content": "You have to concentrate to the point of not having in your mind anything else but the sensation of this noise: do not think to the tram or the clock, but the noise they make. The described exercises you must perform in the solitude of your room at the beginning. Then the student has to begin accustomed to do them in the midst of the people, amid the noise. In doing so he will increase the certainty of being able to concentrate where he wants and when he wants. Exercise 19 -Sleep and wake up. Remember a picture and then return to the present moment. Understand where in your imaginative space the image and details are. In fact, in everyday life, when you lose the presence and retake it, it is normally for an image or a sound. With this exercise, virtually “we change world\" Exercise 20 – the needle Take an ordinary pin, with black pinhead and let it run through the center of the page of a book.",
  "last_phrase": "By regularly practicing these concentration exercises alone and then gradually incorporating them into everyday life, you can increase your ability to concentrate at will. Try the sleep/wake exercise to improve presence and focus, or challenge yourself with Exercise 20, the needle, to increase your memorization skills. With practice, you can change your world by controlling your focus and concentration."
