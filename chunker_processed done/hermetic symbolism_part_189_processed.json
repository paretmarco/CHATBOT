  "title": "Symbolism in the Philosophical Egg and Boat of Isis.",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the symbolism of the Philosophical Egg, the vase with eagle heads, and the zodiacal circle. Now we turn to the mysterious boat sailing to the right of the Virgin, which represents the journey across the Ocean of Life. The boat of Isis is steered by the breath of the Universal Spirit, and is a metaphor for the driving enthusiasm that causes the Cyclops to fall into the sea. This figure, like the Fool in the Tarot, symbolizes the loss of control and self-abandonment to impulse. Let's dive deeper into the complexities of this enigmatic image.",
  "content": "The centre of the zodiacal circle matches that of the philosophical egg, and this centre is marked by the symbol of alum , as if to say that the mathematical centre point of every being can be confused with infinity . A second, golden circle is superimposed on the first, dominating it. This is an allusion to the resulting sublimation of the self. Our task becomes mightily difficult when we turn to cast light on the mysteries of the boat sailing to the right of the Virgin. This is the boat of Isis, which makes the crossing of the Ocean of Life possible; its sails filled with the breath of the Universal Spirit capture the idea of the driving enthusiasm that caused the Cyclops to fall into the sea. This figure, who should have been looking out from the crowâ€™s nest on the main mast, lost his balance under the influence of celestial intoxication. In the same way as the Fool in the Tarot, he then becomes the passive instrument of the force that takes control of him. He has no control and abandons himself unreservedly to his impulses, without thinking.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbolism of the zodiacal circle and the boat of Isis allude to the journey of life and the need for us to be fully present and detached in order to navigate the perils successfully. As such, we must strive to be sensitive, fully cognizant individuals who are in control of our faculties, avoiding the pitfalls of blind faith and rash actions."
