  "content": "Healing a number of pathologies – Reawakening the immune system – French Magnetists: Du Potet – Durville - Maitre Philippe In this age of ours, man, lost in a frantic quest for material objects and opportunities, turns oblivious to the fact that the true key to power is found inside his own self. The role played by the expression “Personal Magnetism” in ordinary parlance is to designate that kind of powerful fascination which some individuals exercise over fellow human beings. Without seemingly doing anything special, in fact, this class of individuals arouse sympathy, interest and consideration. Their presence is welcomed, and one almost feels impelled to win over their friendship and earn their good esteem.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, personal magnetism holds the key to power and influence over others, and its subtle radiance can be felt both psychologically and physiologically. French magnetists such as Du Potet, Durville, and Maitre Philippe, understood the power of personal magnetism in healing various pathologies, and reawakening the immune system. By developing a high level of congruence in behavior, anyone can tap into their own personal magnetism and become a powerful force in their own right."
