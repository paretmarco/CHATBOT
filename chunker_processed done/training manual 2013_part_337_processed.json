  "title": "\"The Linguistic-Symbolical Methodology: Accessing Quintessence Through Elemental Connection\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we learn about exercises for connecting our attention with different elements such as water, earth, and air. These exercises help to release emotions and bodily blocks. The author also introduces the concept of the linguistic-symbolical methodology, which involves resolving oppositions to reach higher degrees of wisdom. In this last part, the author explores the practical way of gaining access to the quintessence via words. We learn that words represent a congealed reality and the outside world on man. This methodology is a great way to gain access to higher wisdom levels.",
  "content": "The Linguistic-Symbolical Methodology In order to be able to rise to higher degrees and reach the quintessence, eternal wisdom teaches us that the oppositions which keep the elements separate have to be resolved: Water must turn igneous, fire must become liquid, earth must be devoid of weight, and air must acquire solidity.91 This modus operandi based on juxtaposing words which seemingly belong to different aggregates, coupled with “breaking the blocks”, might also be carried out at a verbal level. It is another practical way of gaining access to the quintessence. Words, in fact, represent a congealed reality, the actualization of a meaning which is attributed to a sound. They consist in “intellectual knowledge” which obligatorily unfolds itself in a physical time of dualitities and sequence of moments. They further denote an “inertia”. They are the reflection of the outside world on man, on things which are in a state of motion. Words are things which exist in a dimension of spatial and temporal succession.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the linguistic-symbolical methodology offers a practical way of accessing the quintessence by resolving oppositions and breaking the blocks of language. By shifting from division into moments to simultaneity, one can reawaken to a less frozen dimension and tap into their unique subjective being, ultimately reaching eternal wisdom."
