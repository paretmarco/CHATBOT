  "title": "\"The Doctors' Fear: Magnetism and the Fight for Control\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the history of magnetism and its association with 'Medical Clairvoyant' is discussed. While doctors of the early 1800s demanded monopoly over magnetism, their opposition did little to curb its popularity. To achieve fast results with magnetism, one must work on themselves and use all possible elements in the therapy. In this last part, it becomes clear why doctors feared Magnetism, as it allowed anyone to alleviate the sufferings of others. This fear threatened their livelihood and parallels the modern-day debate over hypnotism.",
  "content": "As the great majority of doctors believed that Magnetism was pernicious humbug, it stands to reason that they wanted the exclusive right, to magnetize, not for the sake of making use of Magnetism, but for the purpose of ‘killing it off’ by preventing its employment. It seems strange that, with the public so deeply prejudiced against Magnetism, and with the narrow limits within which its use was conditioned by circumstances, the doctors should fear it so much. The reason why they did so, however, is not far to seek. One of the blessings attributed to Animal Magnetism, and on which every writer on the subject dwells, is that it enables anyone to alleviate the sufferings of others.",
  "last_phrase": "By learning the art of magnetizing, one can alleviate the sufferings of their loved ones, which in turn obviates the need to call a doctor. Despite the doctors' fear, professional magnetizers were happy to avail of the assistance of a family member. The healing power of Magnetism is yet to be recognized."
