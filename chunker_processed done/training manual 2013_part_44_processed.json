  "title": "\"The Power of Fascination: Understanding the Construction of Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This passage delves into the phenomenon of \"fascination\" and how it creates a trance-like state that distorts reality, leading to the construction of the conscious mind or \"exterior I\". As consciousness concentrates in the ego, we separate from our body, leading to a hierarchy where the rational mind is seen as superior to the non-rational mind. This is similar to the hierarchies we create in the world, and hypnosis and mesmerism are transformational systems that can help us overcome this separation and reconnect with our spiritual force. The last 200 tokens explore how these techniques can heal psychological discord and help us reach a more united and whole state.",
  "content": "The \"body\", and all its processes and instincts - are perceived as \"other\" to us. As the Katha Upanishad states \"Where there is other, there is fear\"113 There is a parallelism between the hierarchies we create in the world (men on other men, men on women) and the hierarchy we create inside us (ego on body). The hierarchy of the rational mind on the non rational mind is similar. The rational mind can be thought as a construct, a by-product of our consciousness fixed and fascinated by events and things until the moment in which create a \"model of the world\" based on our experiences. The technique of hypnosis and mesmerism are under this point of view \"transformational systems\", whose purpose is to heal psychological and civilized mind discord, in order to transcend our actual state and reach a more unite and whole state. These techniques can teach us how to overcome our sense of separation, how to be free of psychic entropy, and how to reconnect to our spiritual force.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the hierarchy we create within ourselves, where the rational mind dominates over the non-rational mind, creates a sense of separation that can be overcome through transformational systems such as hypnosis and mesmerism. By unblocking the force of life within us, we can transcend our current state and reconnect to our spiritual force, ultimately achieving a more whole and united state of being."
