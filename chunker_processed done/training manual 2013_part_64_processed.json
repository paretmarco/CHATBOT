  "title": "\"The Power of Symbols and Eggregores in Primal and Modern Societies.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of physical and moral sympathy and its role in communication between individuals. Moving on to the idea of group dynamics, it questions how primal societies, where individual ego plays little to no role, were able to function. The answer, it argues, lies in the power of symbols and rituals. Ideas and aspirations of a group can become represented in a symbol, which in turn rules their daily life, much like todayâ€™s political parties. Unlike today, however, the symbol is not limited to a person but can be an entity in itself, akin to a cultural institution or religion.",
  "content": "Rituals mark the most important moments. Our idea is that rituals and sacred are the way through which the primal mind give rise to a new entity, that we can call \"the symbol\" that in turn will help to rule the everyday life. We see similar principles also in today's reality. Ideas become political parties that in turn rule the same people that created them. In war, the soldier participates in sharing ideals, and these ideals rule them. But in today society the process is hierarchical, and political parties are no more just ideas, are people, that rule and command. In primal society, instead, the symbol most of the times is not immediately identified in a person. It is more similar to the force that a today's cultural institution or religion can have on its members.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the power and significance of symbols and rituals can help us find harmony and meaning in our lives. By recognizing the primal origins of these concepts, we can tap into a deeper sense of connection with the universe and with each other, and use these tools to guide us in our everyday decisions and behaviors. Let us embrace the power of symbols and rituals to transform ourselves and our world."
