  "title": "Could the Barberinist method of diagnosis and animal magnetism be considered a form of quantum entanglement?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the Barberinist school of animal magnetism, a precursor to modern hypnotism. The earlier section describes how the Barberinist method was put to a successful test in veterinary medicine. This final part discusses the development of the Barberinist school, which merged into the \"magnetic branch\" of a network of masonic lodges, with J.B. Willermoz as an important figure. The text also mentions L.C. de Saint Martin, who became known as the \"Unknown Philosopher.\" The members of the Barberinist school were able to induce trance and ecstasy in their patients, leading to visions and apparent communication with the afterlife. The section concludes by describing M. Cahagnet, a man who wrote about spiritualism within the Barberinist tradition, but was not highly educated.",
  "content": "De Barberin and saint Martin developed the doctrines and the practices of what came to be called the \"Barberinist\" school of animal magnetism. The Chevalier de Barberini magnetized his subjects both by manipulations and will, but in most instances, the effects he produced, threw the patients into that state now known as trance and ecstasy. Visions of the most exalted character followed. The “lucids\" described scenes and persona in the other world; traversed the regions of disembodied souls, and only returned to earth reluctantly, to relate their aerial ?ights to wondering listeners, and describe to bereaved mourners, the apparitions of friends who had long since passed beyond the grave. The Continental Miscellanyy and Foreign Review, describes “The New Sect of Barberiniats,\" and af?rms that in Sweden and Germany, where they were very numerous, “these fanatics were called Spiritualists, to distinguish them from the followers of M. de Puységur, who were termed Experimentalists.” M. Cahagnet M. Cahagnet was a man of the people and though a sensible and interesting writer, was neither well read, nor highly educated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism and biologizing as propagated by De Barberin, Saint Martin, M. de Puységur, and M. Cahagnet may seem fanatical to some, but it cannot be denied that their practices have led to remarkable cures of diseases. Despite their lack of formal education, their contributions to the field of mesmerism should not be overlooked."
