  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses how language and form shape the average man into a limited and frozen being, but also how within each person lies the capacity for awakening to a more fluid state of being. This last part introduces \"Linguistic solve et coagula,\" an exercise for breaking down and rejoining opposites to arrive at a more holistic understanding of reality. By breaking up predetermined combinations of words, the goal is to regain the living word and move towards a state of motion.",
  "content": "The process consists in breaking up what has coagulated in a given form, and in joining what is separated; solve et coagula (= breaking up and joining together). Exercise 893: Linguistic solve et coagula Think about two concepts which you deem to be “opposite”. The solve et coagula phase will then operate on the barriers which interpose themselves between “congealed” realities, that are “broken up” in order to rejoin them later (You should accordingly ask yourselves: Are both a and b possible?). We will then proceed to the phase “neither a nor b”. This phase is a different mode of disconnection, one leading to the being which contains in itself both a and b, as well as the other forms it might assume. The last step of the exercise entails us going ahead with the activity of breaking up and rejoining all the predetermined combinations of forms (that is, words). What we aim to regain is the living word, that is, reality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the exercise of Linguistic solve et coagula involves breaking up and rejoining opposing concepts in order to reach a state of being that contains both. The ultimate goal is to regain the living word, or reality. This simple yet effective exercise can be implemented secretly and can lead to significant change over time."
