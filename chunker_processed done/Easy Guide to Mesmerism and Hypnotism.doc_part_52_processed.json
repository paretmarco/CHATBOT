  "title": "\"Inhibition and Hypnotism: Exploring the Connection\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about Heidenhain's experiments on hypnotism and his theories on vaso-motor paralysis. In this last part, Heidenhain proposes a new hypothesis on nervous action, namely inhibitory action, which is now considered to play an important part in all nervous actions. He explains how the terminal fibres of the vagus \"inhibit\" or restrain, while the sympathetic \"accelerate\" the action of the cells. This theory is strikingly visible in lower animals, such as when a ligature is applied around the thigh of a frog, and they lose their voluntary motion.",
  "content": "Section of the vagus is followed by quickening of the heart's action, and stimulation of the lower end causes slowing and if the stimulation be strong enough, stoppage of the heart, not, however in a tetanic state (which would be the case if the fibres of the vagus acted directly on the muscular structure of the heart, as a motor nerve), but in a state of complete relaxation or diastole. Opposite results follow section and stimulation of the sympathetic fibres. It has been clearly made out that the terminal fibres of both nerves do not act on muscular fibres but on ganglion cells, those of the vagus “inhibiting” or restraining, whilst those of the sympathetic “accelerate”, the action of the cells. Inhibition is now known to play an important part in all nervous actions, and it would seem that any powerful impression in a sensory nerve may inhabit or restrain motion. This is strikingly seen in some of the lower animals. A ligature applied loosely round the thigh of a frog whilst it lies on the back apparently deprives it of all power of motion. The weak sensory stimulation in this case seems to stop voluntary motion.",
  "last_phrase": "Inhibition plays a vital role in all nervous actions, as demonstrated by the effects of vagus and sympathetic fibres. The ability to inhibit or restrain motion can occur from any powerful impression in a sensory nerve. The reflex activity, while centered on the spinal cord, can be inhibited by impulses from the cerebral hemispheres. A comprehensive understanding of these processes provides insight into the possibility of using hypnotism to inhibit voluntary movement."
