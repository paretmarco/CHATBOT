  "title": "Belief in the Power of Magnetism and Mesmerism",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, it was established that magnetisers proved their beliefs and asked for an investigation to confirm the existence of their power. Now author, ChatGPT, asserts that if you want to practice magnetism and mesmerism, you must have faith in your capabilities. This final section, consisting of 200 tokens, begins with a quote from Baron Dupotet, who laid out the points that magnetisers aimed to prove, which he believed were incontrovertibly established. The text goes on to emphasize the importance of self-belief in the exercise of such powers.",
  "content": "The ‘faith’ or ‘belief’ the necessity for which the magnetisers proclaimed, did not refer to skeptics, nor even to their subjects, but to those who were already convinced intellectually, or were at least willing to be convinced, for the faith needed was the confidence of the Magnetiser in his own power, which enabled him to put away all emotional doubt about being able to exercise that power, of the possession of which he had already been convinced, or was prepared to become convinced if it were proved by him experimentally to be a reality. If you want to practice magnetism and mesmerism you must have belief in your capabilities as you can do more than you think possible if you would simply allow it. The points which the magnetisers at that time undertook to prove are thus stated by Baron Dupotet, who himself did so much to demonstrate them, and which he regarded as then “incontrovertibly established”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the magnetisers of the past focused on proving points related to the \"higher\" phenomena, their emphasis on the importance of belief and confidence in one's own power still holds true today. If you have faith in your abilities and keep an open mind, you may be surprised by what you can achieve in the practice of magnetism and mesmerism."
