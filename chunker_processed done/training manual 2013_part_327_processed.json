  "title": "\"Remembering Ourselves: Regaining Control of Our Actions\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the stages of man's reawakening to his own self through achieving control over one's activities. The last 200 tokens delve into the need to \"remember ourselves\" in order to avoid falling into a state of trance and unconscious way of reacting. The example of a woman indulging in overeating despite making a promise to herself is used to highlight the importance of being present to oneself. The text discusses the significance of regaining control over automatic conduct and gestures piloted by our unconscious self.",
  "content": "Quite often, we are not present to our own selves. An example that illustrates such truth is when we promise something, either to ourselves or to others, and we then forget our promise only a few seconds later. Technically speaking, we fall into a state of “trance”, that is, into an automatic way of reacting. Take for instance a woman who makes a promise to herself that she is no longer going to indulge herself in over-eating. Shortly thereafter, she passes by a confectionery, walks in, and purchases a chocolate sweet which she proceeds to partake of at once. From a technical point of view, we say that this woman has suffered: 1. An amnesia of the promise she made to herself, and 2. A regression to a moment in her childhood when the chocolate sweet represented for her a source of great satisfaction. In other words, this woman has lived in a trance without being “present to herself”.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to live a more fulfilling and present life, it is important to be aware of our automatic reactions and strive to live outside of a state of trance. While hypnotherapy may offer temporary assistance, the key is to cultivate a deeper sense of awareness in each moment and truly take control of our decisions. By doing so, we can connect with the deeper basis of our being and experience a more lively reality."
