  "title": "\"The Observer and the Observed: Understanding Perception and Experience\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the relationship between the observer and the observed. This time, we delve deeper into the concept of the knower/observer and how it affects our attention and experiences. We imagine a wall with 10 different portholes, each representing a different perception of reality. Each porthole has a different knower/observer, which provides a limited experience of reality. This realization challenges the illusion of a single, stable, and unchanging knower/observer that we usually cling to, causing trauma in chaotic situations.",
  "content": "If you look through porthole #2, the observer sees a partner who is always late for appointments. The observer in porthole #3 experiences fear that possibly there was some accident or mishap. If you look through porthole #4, the observer sees a partner who is prob- ably taking care of an errand that you didn't want to do and so you feel relieved. In each porthole a different \"view\" and hence a different perception of reality. What becomes obvious is that each porthole has a different observer/knower which will provide that limited experience of reality. The appearance is that there is a single knower/ observer that is looking through all these different portholes. The subtle fact is that each porthole has a different knower/ observer. Simply stated, there appears to be one knower/observer you probably call \"yourself' which knows all these different portholes. The fact is that there is a different knower/ observer for each porthole. Each knower/observer can only observe and know its particular knowingness (perception of reality and experience). This illusion of one knower/observer is a major problem in the area of chaos. People have resistance to not having one stable, localized, unchanging knower/ observer; that resistance causes trauma.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our perception of reality and experience are limited by our individual observers or knowers for each aspect of ourselves, rather than a single stable, unchanging knower/observer. Recognizing and accepting this truth can help us better understand and integrate the different parts of ourselves, leading to personal growth and reduced trauma."
