  "title": "Animal Magnetism: Rise, Fall, and Modern Parallels",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the practice of animal magnetism in the 19th century and the different methods used to test clairvoyance, including blindfolding. The author argues that blindfolding always affects clairvoyance negatively and is used to prove that clairvoyance does not exist. The text also mentions the case of Dr. Pigeaire's daughter, who was required to see into a box but was still blindfolded. The last 200 tokens highlight the popularity of animal magnetism in France and the establishment of magnetic institutions and courses of lectures on the subject. However, the author notes that there were issues with the practice, including the use of blindfolding and the fact that \"Doctor's clairvoyant\" had become a regular profession.",
  "content": "That anyone but a born idiot could expect clairvoyance to appear in those conditions is strange; still that kind of thing was, and still is, supposed by some people to be “scientific.” It is strange now, and somewhat pathetic, to read the triumphant prognostications of the speedy and universal acceptance of Animal Magnetism in which the writers of that epoch indulged. Some countries then made a practical course of Animal Magnetism obligatory before taking a medical degree; some foreign universities had established courses of lectures on the subject and offered prizes for essays on it; in many cities magnetic institutions had been founded; and in 1838 it was considered a moderate estimate to say that one-fourth of the doctors of Paris either devoted themselves to mesmeric practice or had recourse to it occasionally. “Doctor's clairvoyant” had by that time become a regular profession, and hardly a town in France but boasted its magnetic physician. There was more than one worm in this fair fruit, however.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the rise and fall of animal magnetism serves as a cautionary tale about the danger of putting blind faith in \"scientific\" practices without proper scrutiny. As we continue to navigate the world of alternative medicine, it's important to approach each practice with an open mind, while also being critical and considering the evidence."
