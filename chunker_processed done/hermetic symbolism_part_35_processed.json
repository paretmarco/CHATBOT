  "title": "\"The Symbolism of Salt: Foundation of Cosmic Creation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we dive deeper into the significance of salt in alchemy. The salt of the philosophers comes from the cosmic ocean and serves as the stabilizing foundation of all bodies. It's a symbol of wisdom, extracted from the salt marshes and transformed into the body of the Stone of the Sages. This substance is dedicated to the Celestial Virgin, and corresponds to the Empress of the Tarot. The heavenly waters result from the evaporation of the chaotic primordial soup, where two opposing tendencies condense and expand.",
  "content": "For now, suffice it to say that Salt is the stabilising foundation of all bodies. For this functional property Salt was established as a praiseworthy symbol of wisdom, coming as it does from the ocean of infinite wisdom. Men must learn to extract it from the salt marshes, where the sun evaporates the stagnant waters. Once crystallised, its substance is transformed into the body of the Stone of the Sages.11 Philosophers, in their piety, dedicated this to the Celestial Virgin, the Universal Mother who is eternally made fertile by the spirit. In truth, the upper part of the Salt symbol corresponds to the ideal of virginity that dominates all earthly realisations of the divine, and the image which is given to us in the form of the Empress (Arcanum III) of the Tarot. But the heavenly waters are the result of the evaporation of all that which was condensed by detraction from the chaotic primordial soup. Two opposing tendencies are thought to intervene in this primordial mass: concrete form-giving condensation, and expansive sublimation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Salt not only plays an essential role in stabilizing all bodies but also represents the concept of unity in diversity. Through its extraction and transformation into the Stone of the Sages, philosophers have dedicated it to the universal mother, emphasizing the dual influences of sublimation and condensation in the creation of the cosmos. By understanding the significance of Salt in the hermetic tradition, we gain insight into the philosophical roots of many ancient beliefs and traditions."
