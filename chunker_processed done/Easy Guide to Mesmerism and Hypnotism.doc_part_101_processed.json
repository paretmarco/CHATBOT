  "title": "\"Misadventures in Mesmerism: A Lesson Learned\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author recounts a story of a gentleman who, after witnessing his success at mesmerism, decided to try it for himself on his footman, with disastrous results. The gentleman had succeeded in putting the footman to sleep and getting him to do various things, but he forgot how to wake him up. Attempts to wake the footman up by others only made things worse. Eventually, the author arrived and used a process of forming a circle with everyone who had touched the footman, explaining the risks of indiscriminate experiments, and calming the patient to successfully de-mesmerize him. The lesson led to the gentleman seeking more training and becoming a successful mesmerist.",
  "content": "I saw how thing stood, and proceeded to demesmerise his footman by the following process:—I got every person in the house who had touched the young man to take hands and join in a circle, the gentleman who had mesmerised the youth taking his (the footman's left hand, while I completed the circle by taking his right hand.) I counselled passivity and calmness on all, and explained to them the risk of indiscriminating experiments, and the dangers which might arise there from, and pointed out that this was a bad case of “Cross-Mesmerism.” By forming the circle, I sought to tone down the tumult, calm the patient, and subject all to my own influence. At the end of fifteen minutes I broke up the circle, placed myself in dominant contact with the patient, and de-mesmerised him. The lesson was not readily forgotten by either the gentleman or his servants. The former had a course of instruction, and became afterwards a very successful mesmerist.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, when performing any kind of mesmerism, whether it be de-mesmerising or treating a patient, it is important to remember Deleuze's mode of procedure. This includes removing any potential distractions, having the necessary witnesses, ensuring proper temperature and lack of interruptions, and having the patient solely focused on the process. By following these steps, you can help your patient achieve the best possible outcome."
