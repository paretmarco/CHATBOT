  "first_phrase": "In this text, we delve into the world of co-dependency, spirituality, and the emptiness that lies within us all. The focus is mainly on the #9 type, who possesses the ability to embody other people's emotions and ideals. However, with this gift comes a deep-seated insecurity and rage when they don't receive the care they crave. They create a false spirituality to cover their perceived nothingness, but it deprives them of entering their empty space, which is essential to finding their true essence. The warning for #9 is getting angry when others can't fill their emptiness. The author stresses that true fulfillment comes from entering our own emptiness, and relying on others to do so only leads to frustration.",
  "content": "The thing a #9 has ________________ to watch out for is getting angry at other people's inability to fill their emptiness. See Illustration #15. Basically, most of us resist our emptiness to such a degree that we get compulsive about being in relationships. We basically say to another, \"Fill my emptiness.\" When this occurs, there is peace, when this doesn't, it's a divorce. Stated another way, we all attempt to fill our emptiness by looking outside ourselves. This habit of expecting others to fill our void can only lead to frustration. Why? Because each of us must enter into our own nothingness and see its value. Running away from our own emptiness and expecting others to fulfill it must fail since emptiness is our true essential nature.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important for individuals with a #9 personality type to recognize the habit of looking outside themselves to fill their emptiness. It's essential to enter their own nothingness and find value in it, rather than expecting others to fulfill it. By doing this, they can avoid frustration and develop a deeper understanding of their true essence."
