  "title": "\"The Emergence of Powerful Magnetic Phenomena in the 19th Century\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the emergence of powerful magnetic phenomena in the early 19th century, as well as the beliefs surrounding it. It quotes from Jules du Potet de Sennevoy and Alphonse Didier, who were proponents of animal magnetism. The author highlights the difference between intellectual belief and emotional belief, with the magnetisers seeking the former through demonstration and investigation. In the last 200 tokens, the author reflects on how the beliefs of the magnetisers were met with skepticism by the materialists of the time. The text serves as a reminder that intellectual belief requires proof and investigation, not just assertion.",
  "content": "If I ask you to believe that the square root of 4356 is 66, you will probably make the calculation for yourself before you feel convinced, for you know that, however honest I may be, I may have made a mistake; but if I ask you to believe that Joshua made the sun to stand still, you must believe me, if you do so at all, simply because you are so good as to take my word for it as your teacher. Now the belief which the magnetisers asked for was of the former kind, which cannot even exist without proof. They proved what they said. Indeed they did not, properly speaking, ask the incredulous to believe, but to investigate, knowing very well that the belief they wished for would follow honest investigation, as certainly as that it could not exist without proof.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the belief and faith required for magnetism and mesmerism are rooted in the confidence of the practitioner in their abilities, proven through diligent investigation and experimentation. Like any scientific endeavor, it is the willingness to be open-minded and pursue evidence that leads to true discovery and mastery."
