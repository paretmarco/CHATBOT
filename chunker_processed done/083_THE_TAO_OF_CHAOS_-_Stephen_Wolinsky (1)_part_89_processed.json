  "title": "\"Moving Thoughts and Feelings in the Phase Space\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraph, we learned about the concept of phase space, which is a way to understand a system's behavior and predict its future. Moving on, the author wonders what would happen if they could move their thoughts or emotions to a different phase of space. They believe that thoughts and feelings exist in a particular area of space and can disappear if the space is changed. The Sufi Master Idries Shah stated that if space or time is changed, the property of the system loses its power. In Chapter 9 on Time, the author will delve deeper into this idea. In the meantime, the Tao of Chaos Exercise #6 instructs us to move our thoughts or feelings to another phase of inner space.",
  "content": "In other words, since a thought can only exist as long as it is in a very particular specific space, then if you change the space the thought is occupying then the thought will disappear. The same goes for feelings. Why is this true? Because the thought can only occupy a specific area of space; change the phase of space and the thought disappears. Noted Sufi Master Idries Shah says it this way; that in the sufi tradition, it is very important to note that there is a space and time for everything. Here, Shah is stating that if the space or time is changed, the property of the system, both internal and external loses its power. This will be discussed in greater depth in Chapter 9 on Time. For now, however, let us explore what happens experientially to our internal state as we change the space that thoughts or feelings exist in. The Tao of Chaos Exercise #6 Eyes Closed. Step I Notice your inner space. Step II Notice a thought or feeling you are having. THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 63 Notice the phase of space the thought or feeling is occupying. Move the thought or feeling to another phase of inner space.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the relationship between thoughts and the space they occupy can help us better manage our internal state. By noticing the phase of space our thoughts and feelings are occupying, we can intentionally move them to a different space and observe what happens. This exercise can be a powerful tool in cultivating inner awareness and resilience."
