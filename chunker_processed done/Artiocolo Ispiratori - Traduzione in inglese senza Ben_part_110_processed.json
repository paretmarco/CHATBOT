  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we dive deeper into Virgilio T.'s hypnotic abilities, as witnessed by the author's friend, Max, and his friends. After Virgilio cured himself of a congenital heart disease, he became interested in hypnotism and demonstrated his abilities on willing participants at the barber's shop where he worked. Through fixed gazes and suggestive words, Virgilio was able to induce physical reactions and even make customers respond to unspoken suggestions. Max and his friends were intrigued and continued to witness similar events on several occasions.",
  "content": "The customer thus addressed began to cough so much that Virgilio was forced to slap him in the face a few times in order to bring him back to his senses. When it came to the second customer, he did not even utter a single word to him. He fixed him closely, and the look of this other customer turned pallid and diaphanous as if it was made of wax. At that point, Virgilio carried out a facetious probative exercise: Faced with the question on what his name was, such customer answered by mentioning a womanâ€™s name which had not even been verbally suggested (to him by Virgilio), only through the power of thought. Virgilio thereupon woke him up. Moved by his curiosity, Max took a number of his friends to Virgilio, and witnessed similar events on several other occasions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio's incredible abilities were not only a source of curiosity but also a chance for self-discovery. Through disciplined work and a series of exercises learned from his own master, Rolando, Virgilio demonstrated the power of self-control and self-improvement, a lesson that we too can apply to our own lives."
