  "title": "Puysegur's Discovery of Somnambulism: The Phenomenon of Magnetism-Induced Sleepwalking",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the discovery of somnambulism through the magnetizing practice of M. de Puysegur, a retired man from Buzancy. During his practice, he observed an entirely new phenomenon from a young peasant named Victor. While under magnetic sleep, Victor was able to communicate telepathically and demonstrate clairvoyance, knowing the treatment required for his illness. This last part of the text gives an account of Victor's case, along with the healing of other patients.",
  "content": "He also demonstrated a phenomenon that would later have been called “clairvoyance”: while in this kind of sleep he himself indicated the treatment necessary for his illness, and he was soon cured. Below is the direct account of the peasant Victor's case. \"After ten days' rest at my estate, without attending to anything but my repose and my gardens, I had occasion to enter the house of my steward. His daughter was suffering from a violent toothache; I asked her in jest if she wished to be cured; she, of course, consented. I had not been ten minutes magnetising her, when her pain was completely gone; and she felt no return of it after. \"Another woman was cured on the following day of the same affection, and in as short a time. This slight success made me try to do some good for a peasant, about twenty-three years of age, who had been keeping his bed for four days in consequence of inflammation on his chest. I went to see him: it was last Tuesday, the fourth of this month, at eight o'clock in the evening; the fever had just become lighter.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the accounts of Victor's case demonstrate the potential of magnetism in curing physical afflictions and inducing a state of tranquility in the patient. This serves as a reminder of the importance of exploring alternative methods of treatment, while also highlighting the power of the human mind in influencing our well-being."
