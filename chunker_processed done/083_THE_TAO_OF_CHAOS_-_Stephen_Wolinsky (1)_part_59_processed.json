  "title": "\"Understanding Dynamical Systems in Psycho-Emotional Limitations\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of dynamical systems in relation to belief structures and interactions. Before delving into the topic, the author illustrates how a fundamentalist Christian perceives a Buddhist and how their interaction creates a system. The author explains that individuals self-organize to maintain their equilibrium and reject disruptions that challenge their self-view. The author argues that this self-organizing of our internal universe causes significant psycho-emotional limitations. The discussion helps us to understand the mechanisms behind our reactions to the world, how we perceive the world, and what happens when we reject new ideas.",
  "content": "The way the Christian organizes his chaos is to be attracted to the path of shut-down which self-organizes herself/himself and leaves her/him with the same certainty: Buddhists are bad. He probably might even see a devilish look in the Buddhist's eyes and mind-read', image and project some evil intent upon this Buddhist, and then react to the Buddhist as if the mind-read is true. This self-organizing of our internal universe in order to maintain its equilibrium causes major psycho-emotional limitations. This is because psycho-emotionally we have an underlying state which is maintained unknowingly through how we self-organize. Generally speaking, we will reject all disruptions to this underlying state and self-organizing, and accept only those which maintain our view of ourself and the world. For example, if your underlying state is \"I am going to be rejected,\" all incoming information is internally experienced as rejection. To explain further; if you have, \"I am going to be rejected,\" as your reference point to be maintained, and I say, \"T like you,\" internally you might not allow that information in because it disrupts your self-organizing reference point.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to break free from the limitations of our self-organizing internal universe, it is important to consider disruptions as information that can help us understand our internal structures. By learning to recognize and challenge our cognitive distortions, we can gain a deeper understanding of who we are and how we relate to the world around us."
