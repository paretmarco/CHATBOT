  "title": "The Controversy Surrounding Pain-Free Surgery in the 19th Century",
  "first_phrase": "Painless surgeries performed under hypnosis or mesmerism were met with curiosity and disdain in the 19th century. This was due to the belief that pain was a necessary and beneficial part of God's order. However, Dr. James Esdaile's success in hundreds of cases using magnetism as anesthesia challenged this belief. In this context, Dr. Kingsbury provides an account of Mr. Squire Ward's amputation of a thigh performed painlessly during hypnosis, which was rejected by medical society members like Sir Benjamin Brodie and Mr. Lister.",
  "content": "Dr. Copeland moved that all mention of Mr. Ward's case be erased from the minutes, because ‘if the account of the man's experiencing no agony during the operation were true, the fact was unworthy of consideration, because pain is a wise provision of Nature, and patients ought to suffer pain while their surgeon is operating; they are all the better for it, and recover better.' Among the others who were present and acquiesced in this folly were Sir Benjamin Brodie, Mr. Lister, Mr. Caesar Hawkins, and Dr. Marshall Hall.\" Dr. James Esdaile, who worked in India, reports hundreds of cases where the use of magnetism was helpful to get anesthesia. Esdaile wrote that “animal magnetism is a natural God-given method of healing. The power produced is similar both in quality, character and degree to the power of the Creator. All men have within them special power given by God to direct their movement and provide for themselves”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the discovery of chloroform provided a quick and reliable way to produce anesthesia in patients, although it came with potential risks and adverse effects. Dr. Esdaile's use of magnetism for anesthesia was effective, but difficult to master. While both methods have been used in history, the development of modern anesthesia has made surgery safer and less painful for patients."
