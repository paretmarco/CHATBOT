  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the transcript, the therapist helps the client to shift their attention to the Essence to let go of the fixation of attention that prevents them from feeling connected and perfect. The therapist highlights that the I-dentities seeking for qualities outside of themselves can never be fully attained through personality but can be made manifest through Essence. By merging with Essence, the essential quality becomes stable. The Tao of Chaos and Over-Compensating Identities are also discussed.",
  "content": "Therapist: Now, from \"back there\" see if you can turn the Identities that are facing forward looking for peace, connection, and perfection around so that they face you. Client: Nods. Therapist: Now see if the I-dentities would be willing to be reabsorbed into the emptiness as you feel the perfection and peaceful connection of \"back there.\" Client: They already have. Therapist: How are you doing? Client: Peaceful. Conclusion This very edited transcript highlights a session where the Observer/I-dentities have a fixation of attention and are \"look- ing for perfection in all the wrong places.\" By shifting the observer's attention around and experiencing the perfection that is Essence, the Observer/I-dentities can let go and be reabsorbed back into Essence, which is prior to personality. Once the chronic habitual pattern of the observer of look- ing outside to fill the emptiness is shifted, and the observer looks to the Essence, and merges with Essence, the essential quality becomes stable. It is important to note with each fixa- tion of attention how the observer/personality dyad labels the ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 171 emptiness. In fixation of attention strategy #1, the emptiness is labeled as imperfection.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the session highlights how shifting the observer's attention to the Essence, and merging with it, can help overcome the chronic habitual pattern of looking outside for perfection. By realizing the perfection and peaceful connection that resides within, the Observer/I-dentities can let go and be reabsorbed back into Essence, which is prior to personality. It is important to note how the observer/personality dyad labels the emptiness and fixates attention, as this can impact the search for perfection."
