  "title": "\"The Power of Magnetism: Removing Pain and Providing Strength\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author discusses the use of magnetism to cure ailments, including transferring pain from one person to another, shaking hands after a pass to avoid carrying away the pain, and using longitudinal passes for strength. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares anecdotes of their experiences, including curing toothaches by pulling the pain to the foot and using warm breathing for strength. The author also emphasizes the importance of willpower in achieving success with passes, and encourages readers to try the experiments with friends and family.",
  "content": "Magnetising Longitudinal-Passes are sometimes made for the purpose of giving strength after faints, haemorrhages, operations, &, but personally I always prefer to throw off whatever is removed by this shaking of the hand Â« Many a toothache have I drawn through the whole body, eventually pulling the toothache out at the foot. It is laughable to hear Patients exclaim, \" Oh! my toothache is in my big toe. Oh! oh!!\" \"Warm Breathing for giving strength. Remember always that it is your Will which brings about the result of the pass. Having made your hands familiar with these passes, as a good pianist is with scales and exercises, you can try a few experiments in your own household, or among your friends.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetizing longitudinal-passes and warm breathing are techniques that some practitioners use in animal magnetism for healing purposes. It's important to understand that the effectiveness of these methods is mainly driven by the power of your own will. With practice, you can experiment with these techniques in your daily life and witness their effects firsthand. However, blindfolding can sometimes produce nervous disturbance, which may affect results. Ultimately, these techniques should only be used alongside standard medical care and under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional."
