  "title": "\"The Power of Clairvoyance and Healing in Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "The author of this text sheds light on the practice of animal magnetism, which was often dismissed as fraudulent. They highlight the barbarous treatment previously administered to a patient by a supposed magnetizer, which included using live pigeons and unsanitary plasters. Despite this, true clairvoyants existed who could foresee disease progression and prescribe effective treatments. Notably, Alexis Didier and Alphonse Didier possessed such abilities. The author explains that the power of healing and finding healing remedies exists in both humans and animals, and should not be dismissed as mere coincidence.",
  "content": "As the name ‘clairvoyancy’ in the ancient books means both a hidden faculty of previewing the future, as well as the capability of using intuition. A prominent feature in Magnetism is the power which clairvoyants are asserted to possess of foreseeing the course of a disease in themselves; and this power the older School attributed to instinct, which put the subject in rapport with Nature, while the later School thought it came from the opening of the inner powers of vision; but all Schools agreed in declaring that the phenomenon was a wholly natural one. In addition, even modern science has ascertained that many animals have the capability of finding their healing remedies112. It therefore has validated these affirmations that instinct can know the remedies to illnesses. Here is what a writer (baron Dupotet) says: “In other cases, however, the phenomena of clairvoyance and lucidity supervene, and the patients prescribe, not only for themselves, but for others, the treatment which should be adopted; and, as I have already advised, the injunctions given in this state should be scrupulously obeyed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, clairvoyancy has been associated with the intuitive ability to foresee the future and the power to detect healing remedies for illnesses. Over time, the art of clairvoyancy has been linked to the natural phenomenon of instinct, putting individuals in rapport with nature. Magnetism has demonstrated that individuals in a state of clairvoyance have prescribed effective treatments for themselves and others. This validates the true curative effects of animal magnetism and its potential for use in modern medical practices."
