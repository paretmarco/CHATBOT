  "title": "\"Hypnotism: States of Sleep and Stages of Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the different stages of hypnotism and how they are similar to the stages of mesmerism. Before this section, the text discusses the essential requisites for being a mesmerist and the various phenomena that can occur in different patients. The three stages of hypnotism, cataleptic, lethargic, and somnambulistic, are explained in detail, and the similarities and differences between them are highlighted. The somnambulistic stage is the most complex and varies greatly depending on the subject. The majority of hypnotic subjects move from the cataleptic to the somnambulistic stage without any apparent condition. The concepts of Braid, Heidenhain, Charcot, and Richet are also discussed in this section.",
  "content": "In the second or Lethargic stage, the subject is a helpless lump of insanity; the muscles are unflexed, flaccid, and flabby, the eyes are closed, and the body is in all respects like that conditioned by a dead faint, or, in a lesser degree, by the coma of drunkenness. Surgical operations can be performed in either stage without real or apparent pain to the subject. The third, or Somnambulistic stage, approximates to the fourth degree of Mesmerism. The subject acts as if in a dream,—but he acts the dream— such as may be suggested by the operator. The phenomena elicited in this stage are complex, so much depending on the temperament and phrenological aptitudes of the subject. With good subjects, memory, reflection, and imagination can be intensified and exalted, the past recalled to the present, and action done therein confessed, should such be determined upon by the operator. As in Mesmerism these states vary—may be developed one after the other on the same subject. The majority of hypnotic subjects pass from the cataleptic to the somnambulistic without any apparent intervening condition.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Braid's mode of inducing hypnosis through fixed gaze and suggestion has been found to produce varying degrees of hypnotic states with complex phenomena in good subjects. This technique may be useful for certain surgical operations or therapeutic interventions requiring heightened memory, reflection, and imagination. However, it should only be performed by trained professionals with appropriate knowledge of the subject's phrenological aptitudes and temperament for safe and effective outcomes."
