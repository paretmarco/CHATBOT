  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed exercises to enhance memory and perception. In the final part, he elaborates on two more exercises to connect \"looking\" with \"watching\" and achieve a state of presence. These exercises aim to eliminate the difference between foreground and background, enabling the mind to perceive everything as a unified whole. Virgilio's quote, \"when I see everything as a unity, I have more power,\" reinforces this idea. The author concludes by explaining how the combination of watching and seeing can achieve a state of presence, which involves the first and second attention.",
  "content": "In this case, it will be advisable to choose a different page. Exercise 21 â€“ count without counting Watch a series of slats or vertical elements and without counting how many there are. This exercise does not interest as memory. As Virgillio says: \"when I see everything as a unity, I have more power\". Therefore, virtually we need to count objects without counting. This technique leads our minds to work better, eliminates mental difference between \"background\" and \"foreground\" expressed in Gestalt terms, namely between part and whole. Further comments on the last two exercises Virtually the last two exercises above mentioned will help us to connect the \"look\" with the \"watch\". This is a typical attribute of a person who is present. Normally this man combines two elements: the watching, which is the act of observing giving attention, and the seeing, which is the act of global perception. The two moments can also be defined as the first and second attention.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning to count without counting and connecting our watching and seeing attention can improve our mental performance and provide a more powerful vision. These exercises can help eliminate the mental difference between foreground and background, enhance our focus and perception skills, and improve our ability to observe and perceive our surroundings as a unity."
