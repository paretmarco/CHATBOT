  "title": "\"Magnetism: Art, Sensitivity, and Speed in Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the text emphasizes three effective systems for successful magnetism: fascination, attention to psychological differences, and the use of symbols to reach the unconscious mind. The author cites examples of successful magnetists, such as Mesmer, Prof. Erminio Di Pisa, and Andalini or Alalouf, who used their energy and gaze to heal patients instantly. However, some practitioners standardized the method, neglecting the importance of the person doing it, and treated it as a standard technique, leading to longer procedures. Furthermore, the author notes the difference between magnetism as an art and medicine as a science, emphasizing that magnetism relies heavily on the sensitivity of the practitioner for faster results.",
  "content": "To give one's own vitality perseveringly to a patient for months, watching the effect of every ‘pass,’ and constantly exerting the will, is a very different thing from the hasty recognition of well-known symptoms, and the scribbling off of an “indicated\" prescription learned from some official list of remedies. The fact is that many times, as the method was standardized, many people thought that the method was more important than the person doing it. In reality for getting results in magnetism regular work on oneself is necessary. Magnetism is more like an art that must rely on sensitivity for getting fast results. If treated as a standard technique and without attention to sensitivity, longer procedures would be necessary. While the magnetic physician was laboriously treating one patient, the “regular” doctor could attend to a dozen. Moreover, he could treat them with a much lighter heart; for when anything went wrong with his patient the medicine was blamed; while if Magnetism did not always cure, it was declared to be the fault of the system of treatment, or of the magnetizer himself.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve fast results in magnetism therapy, sensitivity, self-exploration, and an individualized approach are crucial. Magnetism can be a powerful tool for healing, but standard procedures and reliance on medical clairvoyants can slow progress. Like the doctors' demand for the monopoly on hypnotism, it is important to recognize that the art of healing requires personalized care and attention to the unique needs of each patient."
