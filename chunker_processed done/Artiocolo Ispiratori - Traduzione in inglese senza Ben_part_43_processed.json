  "title": "The Struggles of Mesmer: His Life and Works",
  "first_phrase": "This text portrays the life of a man whose intellectual achievements were met with hostility by his colleagues and the academic community, causing him to leave his homeland under Emperor's order. However, after retirement, this enlightened man found solace in the company of the Elector in Bavaria. Nevertheless, his thirst for knowledge drove him to Paris, where he presented his doctrine to the knowledgeable bodies, only to be met with disdain and hostility yet again due to his radical principles. In this final part, we delve into the details of his attempts to win over the academics and the curious enunciations of his doctrine.",
  "content": "He was 44 years old by then. He addressed the knowledgeable bodies, pleading with their members to examine his doctrine, which was encapsulated in the under-mentioned famous twenty-seven enunciations of his. The knowledgeable bodies, however, examined nothing, and contented themselves with feigning an examination of Mesmer’s novel doctrine. The radical nature of his principles, as well as his assertion that it was possible to cure all diseases through a single remedy, brought upon his person the Faculty’s vituperation. The Royal Society of Medicine and the Academy of the Sciences, which were interconnected by joint membership to the sane coterie, did not extend any better welcome to his submissions.",
  "last_phrase": "In the face of overwhelming opposition and ridicule, Mesmer ultimately found triumph by retreating to the natural world and delving deep into his own understanding. This serves as a powerful reminder that no matter the challenges we face, the pursuit of knowledge and the desire to make a positive impact can help us overcome even the most stubborn obstacles."
