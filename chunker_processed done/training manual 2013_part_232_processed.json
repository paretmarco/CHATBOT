  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the intricate workings of the human visual system, discussing the mechanisms of diplopia, fixation of attention, and blurring. In this final section, we delve into the roles of central versus peripheral vision and the relationship between our subconscious and conscious minds. The text outlines how our peripheral vision is good at detecting motion and can help in engaging our focal vision. Additionally, we learn that focal vision is primarily a conscious function, responsible for object recognition and reading displays. Understanding these concepts can help us gain a greater appreciation for the complexity and wonder of our visual system.",
  "content": "EXCITING THE UNCONSCIOUS Central and Peripheral Vision If you divide our brain into the conscious and subconscious, you could say that cone (central) vision is processed consciously, whereas rod (peripheral) vision is processed subconsciously. At most times, your subconscious mind functions in the background, sifting through huge streams of information for your conscious mind to consider. There are two components of the visual system, focal (fovea) vision and ambient (peripheral) vision. Focal vision is primarily responsible for object recognition, and ambient vision is primarily responsible for spatial orientation. Peripheral vision is good at detecting motion (a feature of rod cells) so movement we do will be recognized and help in fascinating Focal Vision. Focal vision is limited to the central two degrees of vision (i.e., the fovea) and is primarily a conscious function. Focal vision allows one to see clearly in order to recognize objects and read displays. However, since it requires conscious thought, it is a relatively slow process.",
