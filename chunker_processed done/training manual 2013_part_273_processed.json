  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the concept of presence and how it is an essential gift to strengthen our fascinative force. Now, we will dive deeper into Exercise 7, which helps develop our ability to be present and conscious of ourselves. The exercise involves creating a fixed point and paying attention mentally to different parts of our body. By focusing our thoughts and remaining conscious of ourselves, we can break down the barriers that prevent us from admiring our inner harmony. This concept is central to the teachings of Gurdjieff, ancient alchemists, wise Taoists, and those who practice Yoga.",
  "content": "\"While the Id begins to consider itself, they mildly fall, one by one, all the barriers that previously \"being unaware of itself \", prevented it to admire the perfect inner harmony, until He can see itself in its fullness‚Äù73. If we want to fascinate we must learn to be outside of our mental thoughts and conceptualizations of the average person. Exercise 7 Create a fixed point. Try to pay attention mentally to the exact feeling in your right hand, then the left, then right foot, then left.
