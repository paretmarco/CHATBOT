  "title": "\"Exercises for Cultivating Presence and Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the importance of reaching a state where we can choose, decide, and act for the realization of our goals. Now, we will delve into exercises that can help in developing this state of being. Exercise 1 involves acquiring awareness of our own being through linguistic self-pronouncements. The goal is to detach the idea of \"I am\" from external labels and recognize our true reality. Moving beyond linguistic dimension of life, the next stage involves achieving presence, a direct consciousness of the universe, and the only true freedom. The concepts of presencing are supported by observations in current quantum physics.",
  "content": "Presence is not just a philosophical attitude: It is a practical reality. It is a technically ascertainable mental state which is characterized by a different relationship with the reality that surrounds us, with our own selves, and with time. Presence is something that might be attained through a series of exercises which facilitate attention and presence in every single moment of life. Our goal is the direct consciousness of the Universe, which is also referred to by the name \"objective consciousness\", and which is the only true freedom. The ordinary man loves or does not love based on his mental illusions, without realizing that his feelings are linked to external influences or to the state of wealth of his organs. We are thus dealing with a practical philosophy which has the ability to lead a person to a higher state of consciousness, irrespective of his religious affiliation. There is a close relation between the observations by current quantistic physics and the concepts evolved by the technique of presencing.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, presence is a practical philosophy that can lead us to a higher state of consciousness, enabling us to be aware of our thoughts while still \"being\". Through a series of exercises, we can attain this mental state that helps us overcome the dichotomy between thought and being. By achieving this, we can experience true and objective freedom, unbound by external influence or illusions. Ultimately, presence allows us to better understand ourselves and the universe we inhabit, leading to a more fulfilling and harmonious life."
