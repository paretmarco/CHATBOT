  "title": "What is post-hypnotic suggestion and how does it affect behavior?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, we find some cases of suggestion and mesmerism by Dr. Elliotson. In one experiment, he held a hat before the mesmerized subject's face and manipulated his legs and arms without physical contact. In another experiment, Dr. Elliotson gave wormwood to a young man in sleep-walking, who enjoyed it thinking it was sweet cake. He explains that such experiences illustrate how prejudices in our judgment work. Dr. Elliotson's experiments should interest suggestionists.",
  "content": "The doctor says:- \"I told him I had something very nice for him, and put some wormwood into his mouth, which he chewed with great apparent relish, saying, in reply to my question what it was, that he thought it was sweet cake. Such is the force of feeling in sleep-waking. Because he mistook me for someone whom he liked very much, he fancied that what I gave him must he excellent. This is a fine illustration of the working of a prejudice upon our judgment in a waking state.\" Some of Dr. Elliotson's experiences, recorded in the \"Zoist,\" should interest the Suggestionist. For instance, the experiment he thus describes:- \"I attempted to draw up her (the patient's) arms and head by tractive movements, but failed. But I discovered that if I said aloud they would move, they did. If I desired her to raise her arms or move her head, no effect followed; but if I said the thing would take place, it did. There was no attempt at trick in this.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of suggestion can be a fascinating tool for exploring the workings of the human mind. From Dr. Elliotson's experiments to Mr. Brindley's experience, we see how easily our thoughts and actions can be influenced, even in a waking state or after being hypnotized. Understanding the power of suggestion can help us better understand ourselves and others."
