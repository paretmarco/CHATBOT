  "title": "\"The Basics of Magnetic Healing Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text outlines two methods for performing magnetic healing techniques as described by Deleuze. The first method involves downward hand movements that sweep over the patient's face, chest, stomach, and legs to induce deep relaxation. The second method, which is ideal for patients who cannot sit upright, involves making passes along the arms, back, stomach, and legs while maintaining good eye contact with the patient. The goal is to establish a communication connection that allows the magnetizer to have a better influence on the subject. Overall, the techniques presented in this text may induce a feeling of incredible peace and well-being.",
  "content": "All these steps will have a very salutary influence on you subject. When we practice this method in our seminars, people always speak of a feeling of incredible peace and well-being . Method 2 In case the patient cannot raise himself, take your station near his bed in the most convenient manner; take his thumbs, make several passes along the arms, and, if he can support himself upright, several along the back, then; not to fatigue yourself, use only one hand, placing it upon the stomach, and making longitudinal passes, at first slightly touching through the clothes, then at a distance. You can hold one hand fixed upon the knees or upon the feet, while the other is in motion. Finish by passes along the legs, and by transversal passes before the head, the breast, and the stomach, to scatter the superabundant fluid. When the communication is established, one can magnetize very well by placing himself at the foot of the patient's bed, and in front of him ; then directing at that distance both hands from the head to the feet, dashing them aside after each pass so as not to conduct the fluid to himself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the aforementioned steps of the long pass method and specific processes, one can experience the wonderful effects of magnetism that can promote a feeling of incredible peace and well-being. So, incorporating magnetism into the healing process can be helpful to relieve localized pain and discomfort, and improve overall health."
