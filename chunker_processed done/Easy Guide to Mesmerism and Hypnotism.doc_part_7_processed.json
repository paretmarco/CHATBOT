In this final segment, the author, Dr. Paret, introduces the book, \"Animal Magnetism, Early Hypnotism, and Psychical Research, 1766-1925\", which presents the techniques of animal magnetism and mesmerism discovered by J. Coates Ph.D. The book discusses the existence of a force beyond our ordinary reality, which has been used by both positive and negative historical figures like Rasputin, Hitler, and healers. The book aims to investigate and develop techniques to use this force positively for self-improvement and personal magnetism.",
  "content": "It has also been used in negative ways by such historical figures as Rasputin, Hitler, and others. They have also used it by imposing themselves into personal relationships of others, leading to catastrophic ends. It has been used for positive gain as well, by ancient historical figures such as healers, saints, etcâ€¦ By using this force they have been able to do well for mankind. The potential for using this force for positive improvement of man requires us to investigate and develop these techniques further.

PARET We are pleased to offer you, the reader, this interesting book. We believe the contents of this book are both factual and of value to you. This book will help you unveil the techniques of Animal Magnetism and Mesmerism. Psychological hypnotism, NLP, etc., are currently evolving sciences, but what Mesmer discovered has another basis other than those founded in current science. The basis of his discovery contains elements which are beyond plain psychology and those elements used by many modern paradigms.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Animal Magnetism and Mesmerism have been used throughout history for both positive and negative purposes. While historical figures like Rasputin and Hitler misused this force, ancient healers and saints have used it for the betterment of mankind. As we continue to investigate and develop these techniques, we invite you to explore the fascinating facets of Mesmerism presented in this book, which offer a unique perspective beyond current scientific paradigms."
