  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author describes an experiment in which a person is made to see a \"tremendous precipice\" by simply drawing lines and a coil on the floor. In this last part, the author discusses Dupotet's \"magic mirror,\" which was also used to induce visions. Dupotet was known to work a lot with mirrors, which have been connected to magnetism and clairvoyance since ancient times. The \"magic mirror\" was made using charcoal and allowed the viewer to see things that evoked terror, horror, delight, or laughter. The viewer would give vent to exclamations but would not speak.",
  "content": "In a moment or two he sinks down unconscious, and is quickly carried away, to slowly recover consciousness in another room.\" When he comes to himself the subject has no recollection of what has happened, except that the last thing he remembers is that he was standing at the end of the lines looking at the coil, and wondering what would happen.” Dupotet’s “magic mirror” Dupotet worked a lot with mirrors. Since very ancient times mirrors are connected to the practice of magnetism and clairvoyance. Dupotet's “magic mirror”126 was roughly made with charcoal on the floor; after looking in it for some minutes the percipient saw things which greatly excited him, but of which he very seldom retained any recollection; generally what he saw filled him with terror or horror, but sometimes he seemed to have delightful visions, and occasionally he saw things that caused immoderate laughter. Those who were undergoing that experience did not speak, though they gave vent to exclamations.",
