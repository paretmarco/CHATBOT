  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part, we'll examine some of the elements present in Donato's hypnosis experiences as described by Morselli and Dr. Moll. Donato's process involves a forced contraction of all the body's muscles to limit voluntary movements, with the subject's eyes fixed on those of the hypnotist. Donato then examines the room before taking the softest tones to insinuate things with dignity.",
  "content": "It can, however, also be originated secondarily out of the other hypnotic states; and this is more usual. When the experimenter has hypnotized the subject in some other way, and has made him open his eyes, he can fix his own steadily on them and thus induce the same phenomena. A variety of this fascination is to fix the eyes of the subject on some other object—for example, on the finger of the experimenter. In such instance, the fascinated person follows every movement made by the finger. Let us now see some of the elements making up Donato’s experiences: THE MEETINGS OF DONATO The first thing Donato does, after greeting the public upon walking into the stage, is to examine the way the room is arranged. Whilst acknowledging the radiant intelligence on the forehead or in the eyes of many people, he is quiet, as he is sure to be appreciated, and then his voice takes the softest tones, insinuating things with dignity. His gaze is always tan, but without throwing vivid light.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of hypnotism can be induced by fixing the subject's eyes on a certain object, even the experimenter's finger. Donato's experiences serve as a good example of how to approach different audiences, adapting to their attitude and using words to caress or fight depending on the situation. His resilience and ability to triumph over adverse conditions prove that success is always attainable with the right mindset."
