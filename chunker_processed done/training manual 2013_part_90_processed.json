  "title": "\"Balancing the Brain and Solar Plexus for Optimal Health\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding portion of this text, the importance of balancing the burden between the solar plexus and the brain is emphasized. The brain is an instrument that requires proper care and nourishment to work effectively. The solar plexus is described as the power chakra, which can bring energy, effectiveness, and non-dominating power when healthy. Before undertaking any intellectual task, one must prepare their solar plexus. This concept is rooted in ancient wisdom that links the solar plexus to the sun, the heart of our planetary system, and the source of our energy.",
  "content": "Take the example of a motor or an electric torch: if you reduce or cut off the power supply it will work less efficiently. The human brain is like a torch which can be switched on and which can see reality and reason about it. Yes, but the trouble is that, in most people, the torch is not very efficient, it is often no more than a candle, and it doesn't give out much light. So it has to be plugged in to an inexhaustible source of energy which will allow it to develop its full potential; and that source is the solar plexus. Why did the ancients call it the ‘solar’ plexus? Because it is linked to the sun, and the sun is the heart of our planetary system. The source of our energy The brain is active and dynamic but it tires very quickly if the solar plexus doesn't subsidize it regularly. For this reason, before undertaking any major intellectual task, a disciple should first prepare the solar plexus.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the brain is a powerful tool that needs a consistent supply of energy to function efficiently. The solar plexus is the source of this energy, which is why it's crucial to prepare it before any intellectual task. By focusing on the solar plexus and finding inner peace, one can tap into an inexhaustible source of energy and unlock the full potential of the brain. Don't rush into anything, take the time to prepare yourself, and let the energies flow to achieve great things."
