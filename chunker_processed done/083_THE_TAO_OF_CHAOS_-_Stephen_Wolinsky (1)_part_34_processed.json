  "title": "\"The Power and Resistance of Energy Flow\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the topic of chaos and control has been discussed. It was stated that chaos or craziness is generally not acceptable in society and individuals often try to avoid it. However, the concept of Chaos Theory has shown that there might be order in chaos. This last part of the text delves deep into the idea of energy flow and how people try to control it. The author explains that energy flows constantly and freely, be it a thought, a feeling, or a look. However, people have been conditioned to control their feelings and the flow of energy from self-to-self or self-to-other. This often leads to blockage or dissipation of energy which can make individuals feel crazy. This text gives insight into the taboo of energy flow and how it affects individuals.",
  "content": "Yet so much time is spent trying to hold in or not allow the energy flow from self-to-self, or from self-to-other. There are taboos to just allowing the flow of energy. If I say, \"I like you\" to someone (which is a flow of energy) the person might have an experience (which is made of energy) of feeling uneasy. For example, they might have a thought (which is made of energy) \"What does that mean?\" \"Does he like me? Want to sleep with me?\" etc. More often than not the energy from self to other is blocked by self or the energy once received is dissipated or thwarted upon receipt of the energy. In case of the former, the \"I love you\" energy is blocked, solidified, and the energy becomes a thought like, \"Well, I'm not sure, should I or shouldn't I say it.\" This makes the individual feel a little crazy. The individual might dissipate the energy by saying to herself, \"He really doesn't mean it\" or \"Why me, I'm not attractive,\" etc.",
  "last_phrase": "Allowing the natural flow of energy between individuals may cause discomfort and chaos in our systems, but it is a necessary process for authentic connections. By releasing our taboos and resistance towards energy exchange, we can create a more profound and meaningful bond with ourselves and others."
