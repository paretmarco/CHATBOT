  "title": "\"The Smoking Wizard: Herman Michel's Magic Touch\"",
  "first_phrase": "This last section is about Herman Michel, the self-proclaimed \"wizard of smoking\", and his unique approach to helping people quit smoking. In the preceding paragraphs, we are introduced to Herman's warm and friendly demeanor, which makes him the ideal confidante. The text then takes us through Herman's treatment process, which involves a combination of finger-pointing, vibration, and massage techniques, aimed at de-conditioning the nerves that trigger smoking. The author notes that while some patients require annual visits, others are conclusively healed, and some experience relapse. Despite this, Herman claims a 60-90% success rate, making him a popular choice for those looking to quit smoking.",
  "content": "This is a procedure which is called by the name «pass» and is practiced by almost all healers throughout the world, based on different reasons. Doctors allege that it helps bring about a state of psycho-physical relaxation, while several people make use of it so as to heighten the hypnotic state. Be it as it may, it only lasts a few moments. After that, the treatment is brought to a close. Thanks to it, Herman Michel asserts, a percentage of patients ranging from sixty to ninety per cent is cured from smoking, though in varying ways. While some of them have to come back on an annual basis to be «de-conditioned» again, others are conclusively healed, while a third group resists for a while and then suffers a «relapse».",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the \"pass\" procedure is a widely practiced technique among healers around the world with varying effectiveness in curing smoking addiction. It only lasts for a few moments, but for some patients, it can lead to conclusive healing. However, the patient's deliberate effort is still required to maintain the treatment's benefits."
