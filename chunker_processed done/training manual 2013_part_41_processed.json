  "title": "\"Unlocking Life Force and Developing Clairvoyance through Movement and Staring\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned how reflected light can help in developing intuition and clairvoyance. We also examined how different types of breathing can bring various results while staring. In this concluding part, we will be discussing the key to unleashing life force and untying the force of life. Mesmerism works on energy and life force, and movements and convulsions are some techniques used to unblock the force of life. The concept of unblocking energy is widespread and is similar to the idea of kundalini in India and chi in China. We will discuss how an awakening dance can remove blockages in energy channels, which could lead to a free flow of energy, promoting overall physical and mental well-being.",
  "content": "Mesmer said: “To solve a problem, you increase the symptom until it becomes critical, because in this way you help the efforts of Nature, and you bring it to a healing crisis. The crisis is the way to solve the problem”. For Mesmer the cause of all sicknesses is a blockage in the flow of energy. UNBLOCKING LIFE FORCE AND RELEASE THE TIES OF LIFE The concept that there is a basis energy in man that must be make free from his \"petrified\" state is widespread. This basis energy could be called \"life force” or the kundalini of Indians, or chi in china. We could call it also \"living force\" as its dimension is everywhere. Unblocking energy is a concept widely diffused. There are similar conceptions in India. An awakening dance can remove the barriers of the energy: in fact somehow, the passageways for the energy got blocked, with years of sleep and regular bad habits. As dense energies got to a person, barriers formed into the energy channels.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, unblocking the life force, which is the energy that flows throughout our body, can help release the ties of life that cause various health problems. Through practices such as Kundalini awakening dance, we can remove barriers in our energy channels and allow the vapors of Kundalini to rise again without causing pain. By understanding and harnessing our life force, we can lead a more balanced and fulfilling life."
