  "title": "\"The Painful Deception of Vanity and Self-Image\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the issue of vanity and the pain it can cause when we construct an image of ourselves that is not based on our reality. The author uses examples to show how people fall in love with their own created images and defend them against others. The last 200 tokens focus on a woman who realizes that her fixation on self-improvement was driven by a desire to look good to others, and how this realization was painful for her. The author also discusses the approach of transmuting internalizations in Self Psychology and Object Relations therapy to work on these grandiose internal narcissistic images.",
  "content": "What frequently drives people into psychotherapy is that the discrepancy between the way they want to be seen and the image they present is much different from how they feel inside. Stated another way, people fall in love with their own created \"cool\" images. They then sell the \"cool\" image to the world, pretend they didn't create the \"cool\" image, pretend they are not pretending and are their images, and defend the images against others thinking they're \"not cool.\" These created images are a defense against who they imagine they are, not who they really are. Recently, for example, I was doing a Quantum PsychologyÂ® workshop. A woman, to her credit, experienced and acknowledged her self-deceit and vanity. She thought she was doing all this internal psycho-spiritual work for herself. She realized that her fixation of attention was a #3, and that all the work she was doing on herself was so that she would look good to others. This was a painful discrepancy. At the level of character analysis, the person appears as if they are in their body and present, when actually they are not.",
  "last_phrase": "It's important to remember that people's self-created images aren't necessarily who they truly are. Acknowledging and working through this internal discrepancy can be a painful but necessary step in personal growth. Remembering that people may not always be fully present in their bodies can help us better understand and connect with those around us."
