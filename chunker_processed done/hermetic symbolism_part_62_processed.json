  "title": "Symbolic Masonry: The Set Square and Swastika",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve deeper into the concept of Philosophical Geometry and the role of the Set Square in symbolic construction. The right angle plays a crucial role in geometric symbolism, as it represents the combination of opposites. Masons use the Set Square as a fundamental tool in creating a stable and solid masonry. The master's task is to maintain harmony and coordinate with his collaborators, observing discipline and reconciling antagonistic elements. This allegory leads us to the symbolism of the Swastika, one of the oldest sacred symbols in Indo-European history.",
  "content": "Having said that, in order to address their purpose fully, these materials must satisfy the requirements of the Set Square, which determines the essential configuration such that the stones can fit into them precisely. Without this instrument, the Masons believed that no masonry would be possible. They turned it into the symbol of the Master who directs their labours, as his fundamental mission is to maintain a good harmony among all his collaborators. To this end, he must have the ability to reconcile antagonistic elements, according to the learning derived from the Set Square, the combination of the horizontal and vertical. Furthermore, he must make himself observe discipline, the basis for all association. And here, the Set Square is an eloquent emblem, given that outside of it there can be no coordination. Rule, law, order, equity, justice, organisation - everything, in effect, is interrelated, with the constructive allegory of the need to correctly fit together the stones destined to join together in a seamless continuity, in order to create a perfect edifice. The Swastika The symbolism of the Set Square throws an unexpected new light on the mystery of the oldest sacred symbol in Indo-European history.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Set Square serves not only as a practical instrument for masons but also as a symbolic representation of the Master's mission to maintain harmony and discipline among collaborators. Its combination of the vertical and horizontal represents the importance of reconciling antagonistic elements and observing discipline, which are essential for all associations. Additionally, the Set Square sheds new light on the symbolism of the Swastika, representing the Sacred Fire and the Great Architect of the Universe, which governs the quaternary of Elements from potential to action."
