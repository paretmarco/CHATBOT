  "first_phrase": "In this part, we delve deeper into the importance of light and its effects on the mind. We learn that visible light is composed of the seven colors of the spectrum and plays a crucial role in our physical and therapeutic wellbeing. We also discover that light has a striking effect on the mind and that it is a superposition of different colors. It's essential to follow specific guidelines while observing light and not to use it in case of any medical issues. Remember, the key to getting cerebral effects is not the direct light but the paraluminous trace that you will experience with closed eyes.",
  "content": "It has been shown that the spectrum of the arc-light is practically identical with that of the sun, the difference in the light being one of intensity and not of kind, the physical and therapeutic attributes of the solar and arc-light can reasonably be supposed to be the same. Clinical and spectroscopic observations have confirmed the correctness of the supposition. The seven different colors or rays of light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These rays are known as the visible rays in contradistinction to numerous forms of invisible light-energy situated beyond either end of the spectrum (infra-red and ultra-violet rays). Some of the rays, notably those emanating from the red and more especially from the infra-red fields of the spectrum, produce heat and are, therefore, known as thermic ray. Light has striking effect on the mind Quantum Physics Light is a superposition of different colors. A white photon doesn't exist.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the physical and therapeutic properties of arc-light and solar light are reasonably considered to be the same. The visible rays of light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, and the light has a striking effect on the mind. Quantum physics supports the idea that consciousness is related to the superposition of different states in the brain. This connection between light and consciousness opens up an exciting new field of research that may lead to groundbreaking insights into the nature of the human mind."
