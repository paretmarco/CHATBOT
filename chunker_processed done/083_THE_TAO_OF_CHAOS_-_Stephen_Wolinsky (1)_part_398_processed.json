  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author raised some controversial notions that challenge current accepted views about the workings of the nervous system. The author questioned the idea that the nervous system functioned solely as an input-output system and posited that it operates to maintain its organization while selecting structural changes to continue operating. The author also questioned the notion that the brain contains a model of reality, challenging the views that we get from our education. In the following 200 tokens, the author deepens these ideas and introduces the concept of Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "We speak here of a nervous system within itself. We live, however, in interaction and communication with others. Here we come to a present confusion to many people who have investigated thinking and the nervous system. Because we use symbols and representations in our communication, we have too easily assumed that these representations are internalized within the system, and that they are operative within the workings of the system, i.e., that our brain contains a model of reality. If we go back to the examples cited at the beginning of this essay, one can begin to discern that this model of the brain does not fit with what one experiences when a perception shifts. The perception is evoked by interaction with an environment, but the perception is a structure, a learned organization, that maintains a compatibility between ourselves and the world. These are difficult points. They challenge the received views that we get from our education. We need these basics, however, to begin to investigate the more complex matters brought to attention through Quantum Psychology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our perception and understanding of reality are not solely based on an internalized model within our brains, but rather a learned and constantly evolving organization that is shaped by our interactions with the external environment. This challenges commonly held beliefs about the separation between mind and body, and prompts us to reevaluate our understanding of the nervous system and the complex workings of the human psyche. Through increased awareness and observation, we can begin to uncover the intricate relationship between mental and motor functions, and further explore the fascinating realm of Quantum Psychology."
