  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learn about Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism and its potential for contact with nature. In this final section, Puysegur continues to test his findings, discovering that somnambulists can react at a distance. He magnetizes his subject, who feels nothing at first, but upon slight hand movements, experiences pain and heaviness. As Puysegur steps away, the pain disappears, and he is able to induce somnambulism from a distance. This breakthrough in somnambulism paves the way for further exploration of this phenomenon.",
  "content": "I was at length about to leave him, when, on slowly removing my hand from his stomach, he fetched a sigh, and complained that I was hurting him. As I was not touching him, I could not at first believe it; but he hastily took my hand and lowered it, saying that it stopped his breath. I quickly brought myself again into contact with him, expecting that he would now feel a more intense sensation, but it proved quite the contrary; the pressure of my hand had no effect whatsoever. Upon removing it to a distance of about one foot away from him, he again complained; at two feet distance, he felt a weight on his breast, and desired me to withdraw. I then drew myself back by degrees, and stopped only when he told me his pain was gone and he felt nothing. I was then five paces from him; I magnetized him at that distance by a slow and circular oscillation of my hand; and immediately his head reclined on his shoulder, and somnambulism supervened.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's experiments with magnetism demonstrate that a stable state can be induced through magnetic influence from a distance, leading to remarkable healing effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the power of magnetism in inducing somnambulism and treating illnesses, opening up exciting possibilities for future research and innovation in the field of alternative medicine."
