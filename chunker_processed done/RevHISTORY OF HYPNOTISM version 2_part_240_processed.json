  "title": "\"A Case of Animal Magnetism and Remarkable Prediction Fulfillment\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, a girl had made a remarkable declaration stating that she wouldn't eat anything for thirty hours, during which her scrofulous matter would be expelled from her system, and she would recover perfectly. On the predicted day, many people witnessed the complete development of her crisis, causing her face to swell and her limbs to stiffen. After some effort, her locked jaw and discoloured tongue were taken care of. In this last part, the author reveals his decision to stay with her for the next thirty hours as the severity of the crisis continued.",
  "content": "On arriving, we were informed that the crisis had declared itself a few minutes sooner than she had predicted, and that it was fully developed. On entering the room we saw the unfortunate girl with her face swelled, her tongue protruding out of her mouth, nearly, to all appearance, cut in two by her teeth, her limbs stiffened, and her jaws so firmly locked that it was impossible to open them. After having magnetized the masseter muscles so as to remove the stiffness of the jaws, I caused the tongue to be drawn in, which was already very much discoloured, and fortunately had only been bitten very slightly. No one had yet perceived that one of her fingers had not only been bitten, but that there was a loss of substance, the piece wanting having been swallowed by her during her previous paroxysm. The wound was now dressed, out of which no blood, but a great quantity of red lymph issued. As the violence of this crisis continued, I thought it proper to remain with her during the ensuing thirty hours.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism can have profound effects on the mind and body, as demonstrated by Dr. Loewe's successful treatment of the unfortunate girl and the woman with long-suffering. While it may not be a commonly accepted practice today, the cases outlined here serve as a reminder of the importance of open-mindedness and exploration in the field of medicine."
