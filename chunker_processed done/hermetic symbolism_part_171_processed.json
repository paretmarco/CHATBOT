  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the text delves into the symbolism of the woman giving birth and her role as a representation of the divine consciousness made flesh. The Virgin Mary's immaculate conception is explained as a result of the Holy Spirit fertilizing her exceptional purity. The author points out that esotericism manifests in different ways and that even the Virgin Mary has similarities with other pagan goddesses. The text concludes by highlighting the lack of syncretism among some Catholics in recognizing the Virgin Mary in works of art like Saint Maurice of Reims, where she is represented as the Mother of Christ, also known as the Queen of Heaven.",
  "content": "The Holy Spirit comes from both the Father and the Son simultaneously; the direct result of the divine thought, not yet expressed or formulated, but spiritually conceived by the divine consciousness, if it can be explained in such a way. This transcendent thought, the essence of which is incomprehensible, can only become manifest by taking bodily form in a consciousness that by its exceptional purity has become receptive. This is the explanation for the work of the Holy Spirit that fertilises the immaculate Virgin in Catholicism. If this Virgin presents esoteric analogies with Isis and many other pagan gods, the reason is that fundamentally there is only one esotericism38, which manifests itself in different ways, just like the fantasies of the poet-philosophers who created the early legends. Seen in this light, Catholics today lack syncretism when they refuse to recognise their own Virgin in the Queen of Heaven glorified in the painting of Saint Maurice of Reims, as there is no doubt that the artist was trying to represent the Mother of Christ.",
  "last_phrase": "To understand the initiatic symbolism of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the twenty-two kabbalistic trumps of the Tarot can be useful for deciphering graphical mysteries charged with dangerous secrets. Ultimately, while the Catholic Church may struggle with syncretism, the idea of Christ conceptualized by the Fathers of the 17th century was on an infinitely higher level, and the picture under scrutiny is excessively Catholic, making it difficult for those with weaker faith to recognize the divine shepherd."
