  "title": "The Life and Career of Mesmer: From Childhood Curiosity to Medical Practice",
  "first_phrase": "This text chronicles the formative years of a young boy named Mesmer who had an innate curiosity and inclination towards researching causes, which later led him to the discovery of animal magnetism. In his teenage years, he pursued education in theology but later shifted his focus to philosophy and medicine. During this period, he also secretly studied astrology, alchemy, and physics. He obtained his first diploma as a doctor in 1759 and went on to study medicine under the tutelage of Van Swietten, one of the greatest German doctors of that age. This last 200-token section sheds light on Mesmer's early medical career and his relationship with Van Swietten.",
  "content": "At the age of 16, Mesmer was as educated as his schoolmates in spite of his frequent outings to the countryside. Thereafter, he pursued his studies further. The only certain thing about this period is that, after completing his education, he refused to devote himself to theology, a discipline he had been earmarked for, preferring instead to consecrate his self to philosophy. It is here that he obtained his first diploma as doctor in 1759. Thereafter, he dedicated himself to medicine. This phase of his life is little known. We might cogently surmise that he simultaneously carried out secret studies of astrology, alchemy and physics (given that they represented largely banned sciences by then). Mercury, that in alchemistsâ€™ work share some of the characteristics of Mesmeric fluid As for medicine, he studied that science under the celebrious Van Swietten, one of the greatest German doctors of that age. He became a doctor in Vienna in 1766. Van Swietten himself wrote a note of encomium for the doctoral thesis Mesmer had submitted.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmer's life was filled with academic and esoteric pursuits. Despite straying from his original path in theology, he became a successful doctor under the mentorship of Van Swietten in Vienna. He also developed an interest in astrology, alchemy, and physics while befriending Mozart in the esoteric circles. Mesmer's life remains a fascinating example of a Renaissance man dedicated to both science and the arts."
