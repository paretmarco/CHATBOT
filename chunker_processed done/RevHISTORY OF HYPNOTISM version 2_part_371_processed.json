  "title": "What can we learn from Elliotson's exploration of phreno-mesmerism and willpower in hypnotism?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, it was discussed how Dr. Elliotson experimented with phreno-mesmerism and found that arbitrary associations do not necessarily disprove natural divisions of brain function. In the last 200 tokens, Elliotson's beliefs about the will and the curative effect of mesmerism are examined. He believed that concentrated attention and purpose make the strongest kind of will and that he operated through magnetism, an intrinsic virtue in the manipulations. This division is interesting because it suggests a concept of quantistic entanglement. Elliotson's insight can be valuable for modern hypnotists who work only with imagination, as he cited two other forces that can make their practice more efficient: willpower and magnetism.",
  "content": "He does not seem to have perceived that the manipulations are means which carry volition in themselves, if made with the attention and purpose, which, he says in many places, are necessary to produce an effect-that, in fact, concentrated attention and purpose in combination make the strongest kind of will-and he does not appear to have suspected that he himself, every time he mesmerised, exercised his will without knowing it. In later years, he thought that the phenomena could be produced in three ways- by Magnetism; by imagination; and by will power; but he believed that he operated not by will power or by imagination, but by Magnetism, that is to say, by some intrinsic virtue in the manipulations. His division is nevertheless interesting if we think that magnetism is some sort of quantistic entanglement between two people. What Elliotson meant by “operating through magnetism” means “to entangle with the subject and have him heal without putting voluntary effort, but helping him to recover naturally his new state”. What we can learn from Elliotson: normal hypnotists work only with imagination. Ellliotson cited two other forces (willpower and magnetism) that make our practice more efficient.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Elliotson's ideas and practices have provided valuable insights into the nature of hypnotism and its potential for healing. His recognition of the power of willpower and magnetism and his understanding of the unconscious mind are concepts that are still relevant today. By applying these concepts, hypnotists can create more effective and efficient sessions, helping their clients achieve their desired results."
