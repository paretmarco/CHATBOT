  "title": "\"The Mid-Point: Understanding the Pendulum of Inner Thoughts\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the concept of the pendulum of inner thoughts and feelings is explored further. The Sufi school of the Fourth Way introduces the mid-point, which is the gap or space between two states of being. Many self-development schools also mention this mid-point. Questions are raised on how to stabilize this self-remembering mid-point, how the pendulum begins to move, and how to go beyond this mid-point. These questions invite reflection on the nature of our being and the ways we perceive and relate to ourselves.",
  "content": "It appears as though it is in the freezing of a part of the pendulum that subjective chaos ensues, rather than just allowing thoughts feelings, and relationships to flow one to another. The Sufi school of the Fourth Way talks of the mid-point. What then is the mid-point? The mid-point is the gap or space that occurs as one emotion or thought changes to another. For example, if I have a thought or I-dentity called \"I'm bad,\" before it turns into another thought or I-dentity called \"I have â€¢ we can translate into the mid-point or that gnawing inner emptiness. Many schools of self-development mention this mid-point or gap between two states, i.e., powerful, before it turns into powerless. In other words, the gap between the two states: some in the space between two breaths, some in the space between two thoughts. Several questions emerge, however, at this point in developing a Tao of Chaos and a-reabsorption of I-dentities. 1. Can this mid-point of self-remembering become stable? 2. How does the pendulum start to move in the first place? 3. How does one go beyond the mid-point of self-remembrance? 4.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and finding stability in the mid-point of self-remembering can lead to a deeper understanding of the self and one's relationship with chaos. By exploring the psychological factors that defend against the mid-point and delving into the space of Essence before the pendulum starts, one may find answers to the questions posed and further develop their personal Tao of Chaos."
