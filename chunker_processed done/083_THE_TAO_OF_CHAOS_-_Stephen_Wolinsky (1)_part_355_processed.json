  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, the text concludes by emphasizing the importance of freeing oneself from the observer I-dentity unit to achieve objective consciousness. The author explains that trauma is formed when we resist the experience of many knowers that have motion, which we mistake for a single stable and organizing knower. By giving up the knower/observer unit and dismantling the attention between the observer and the observed, one can master the Tao of Chaos. This text references teachings from G. I. Gurdjieff and Ramana Maharishi, and discusses the concept of consciousness with no object.",
  "content": "Once the observer/observed disappears we are left with G. I. Gurdjieff's \"objective consciousness\" or consciousness with no object. This was also called the I I by Ramana Maharishi. In the final analysis, each knower has different knowing. Trauma is formed because we resist the experience that there is not one stable knower but rather many knowers that have motion; i.e., which appear and disappear. If we allow the appearance and disappearance to naturally occur without the assumption that we have a definite location and have always been here (the illusion of time), there is no internal experience of trauma. If we resist and insist that we are in a particular location and are this one stable organizing knower, we will know TRAUMA. In the no-state of objective consciousness, the issue of chaos and order never arises. This understanding of the appearance and disappearance of different knowers and knowings as a unit which are both made of consciousness is something that may not occur overnight. To give up the knower/knowledge observer/observed unit which holds the knowledge of location, and to take apart the attention between the observer/ observed dyad along with the knower that knows the knowledge of duration (time), is to master the Tao of Chaos.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, accepting the concept of multiple knowers and knowings that appear and disappear is key to avoiding trauma and reaching objective consciousness. This understanding takes time to develop and requires giving up the notion that we are one stable knower located in a specific place and time. By embracing this Tao of Chaos, we can eliminate the divide between observer and observed and attain a state where the issue of chaos and order no longer arises."
