  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we learned about Mesmer's contribution to uniting traditional healing practices with an alchemical and esoteric philosophical background to create mesmerism, a new form of healing. In this final part, the focus is on the development of mesmerism after Mesmer, leading to the splitting of different streams of the discipline such as magnetism and hypnotism. The text also mentions the recognition of mesmerism as a valid healing method by several European nations and the Academy's decision to re-examine it. It further explains how Doctor Foissac's 1825 memory played a crucial role in the re-examination of magnetism.",
  "content": "There we shall find, it is true, some traces of a most pardonable, if not praiseworthy, excitement and enthusiasm in reference to the wonderful beneficence of the new revelation which mesmeric discoveries seemed to embody. There we shall read of some procedure in which we shall fail to discern the true workings of Mesmer's own ideas” Sinnet – The rationale of Mesmerism Mesmerism, as it is the recognition of the principle of vitality inside man, continued to be practiced after Mesmer and began to be recognized by many European nations as a valid healing method. Accounts of healing continued to arrive and the practitioners became more and more numerous. In 1825, Doctor Foissac addressed to the Academy a memory in which he proved that the time had come to submit magnetism to a new examination. This memory was taken into account. The Academy then examined anew whether it should engage in a re-examination of magnetism in the first place.",
  "last_phrase": "Despite the odd and hostile arguments against Mesmerism, the Academy recognized the need for a re-examination and the practice continued to gain popularity as a valid healing method. The declaration that \"in the field of sciences no judgment whatsoever should be taken as being absolute and irrevocable in nature\" serves as a reminder that even established ideas should be subject to re-evaluation and scrutiny."
