  "title": "\"The Importance of Accessing the Enteric Brain for Well-being\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explains how certain practices such as magnetism and passes can help achieve balance within our bodies. By deactivating the upper brain through sensory isolation and using fascination, we can access the enteric brain more easily, leading to a state of quintessence. The author also introduces the concept of VITRIOLUM, which ancient alchemists believed was the key to healing. The text emphasizes the importance of communication between the upper brain and the solar plexus to achieve well-being.",
  "content": "In this way access to it will be easier as we will have less disturbance of thoughts. At this point balance will follow naturally and we will achieve a state of quintessence. VITRIOLUM Ancient alchemists said that for healing, the basis was VITRIOLUM, that means Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultam Lapidem Unicam Medicinam, in English: go to the interior of the earth (where earth can also be intended as body) and working you will find the occult stone, the true medicine21. They had already understood that accessing the interior part of us (and some wrote also “the inferior part of us”) was the key for the well being. We must also observe that “interiora”, in latin, means also the enteric part of the body. The brain and the solar plexus The upper brain is not cut off from the solar plexus, but it must learn how to communicate with it, and this is why it cannot always take advantage of the support provided by the solar plexus.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by accessing the interior part of ourselves, we can achieve balance and well-being. The ancient alchemists emphasized this with the concept of VITRIOLUM, which involves rectifying and finding the \"occult stone.\" Furthermore, the communication between the upper brain and the solar plexus is crucial, as the latter can feel and restore balance in every cell of the body. So, embrace the power of accessing the interior of the body for healing and balance."
