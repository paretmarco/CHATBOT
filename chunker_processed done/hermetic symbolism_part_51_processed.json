  "title": "\"The Universal Mediator: Understanding Mercury in Hermetic Philosophy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the nature of Mercury as the essential mediator between different planes of existence and the first matter of the sages, which becomes animated and fertile through the addition of the Cross. The hermetic philosophers referred to Mercury as Azoe, which represents the beginning and the end of everything. The symbol for Azoth is linked to the image of Arcanum III, which represents the Empress, the Queen of the Heavens. The author explains how this symbol no longer represents the spirit of all things, but rather the celestial spirit, which spiritualizes and elevates us. This discussion takes place in the context of the kabbalistic concept of Binah or Intelligence.",
  "content": "When the symbol for Azoth is inverted, , it is linked to the image of Arcanum III, which represents the Empress, the Queen of the Heavens, or the Winged Virgin of the Apocalypse . If we analyse the symbol we will see Antimony atop a defeated Crescent (sovereign purity that flees from all altering influences but which, nevertheless, exercises an irresistible purifying power over everything that is inferior to it). On the other hand, we could also represent it as Gem Salt crowned by the Cross , that is, spiritualised, sublimated or glorified, having acquired the highest of virtues. In fact, this symbol no longer represents the spirit of all things, or the embodiment of the universal life force , but rather the celestial spirit, whose aim is to strip us of all material worth, raising us up and spiritualising us. However, it is necessary to remember that we are speaking here of the universal plane, that is, the highest spheres of thought that dominate the world. We are in fact in Binah (Intelligence or Understanding), which corresponds to the third term of the first triad of the tree of sephiroths, or simply to kabbalistic numbers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbol of Azoth, when inverted, represents the celestial spirit that aims to strip us of all material worth and spiritualize us, ruling in the sublime regions of pure intellect. Mercury, as the universal mediator, serves as a link between the metals and planets, displaying a neutral character that is the base upon which all qualities are begotten. Understanding the symbolism and the elements involved can help us better grasp the complexities of the universe and our place within it."
