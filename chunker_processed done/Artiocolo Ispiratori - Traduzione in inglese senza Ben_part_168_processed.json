  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the concept of the \"Archeus\" or the force that moves and digests matter in nature. We also discussed the existence of the Central Fire, which lies dormant until awakened by external fire. In this final section, we will look at the life and beliefs of Apollonius of Tyana, an ancient figure who prayed to the sun and acknowledged it as the God in person. Apollonius would call on the sun for guidance and protection, and he practiced Sun-gazing, the ancient technique of deriving energy from the sun through direct gazes. While this practice can have potential benefits for mental, physical, and spiritual health, it is important to note that looking directly at the sun can be harmful.",
  "content": "“For he said that, whereas other men only make conjectures about the divinity and make guesses that contradict one another concerning it, -- in his own case he said that Apollo had come to him acknowledging that sun was the God in person” (Flavius Philostratus, The Life Of Apollonius Of Tyana). Either at sunrise or at noon, Apollonius would say the following prayer: “O thou Sun, send me as far over the earth as is my pleasure and thine, and may I make the acquaintance of good beings, but never hear anything of bad ones, nor they of me.\" Looking at light Sun-gazing is the ancient practice of deriving nutritional energy directly from the sun by simply gazing at it intently for one hour, at either sunrise or sunset. Objectives vary from person to person, but most sun-gazers seek better mental and physical health, along with a higher level of spiritual awareness. We do not however advise to look at the soon, as its light is too strong.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while sun-gazing may offer potential benefits such as better mental and physical health and increased spiritual awareness, it is important to exercise caution and avoid looking directly at the sun. Instead, utilizing artificial light can offer similar benefits and can be combined with magnetism for even greater results. Dr. Lefebvre's research highlights the power of light in improving concentration and unlocking psychic gifts, offering a practical approach for those seeking to enhance their overall wellbeing."
