  "content": "“We should develop a language based on things and images to avoid false meanings”37 Mesmer used a set of symbols to enhance both the results and a specific setting. Several manuscripts help us to learn about them and we have: 1) a specific set of symbols used to focus the mind in the study of animal magnetism, 2) a set of alchemical symbols to be placed on the wall (or on the floor) during the séances. Symbols can entangle with the unconscious mind and help the person to change. We have used symbols in many ways. The most common feedback we get is that the person feel energized, with an enhanced vitality. We have also seen in our practical therapeutic experiences that symbols work not only on the mind of the magnetisee, but even on the mind of the magnetiser. They also speed up the operations. Practical hint: think in symbols and observe how your perception can change. Find your symbols for personal evolution. Meditate on the meaning of some geometric symbols such as the square, the circle, etc… Fire, Energy and Matter In Mesmer’s Harmony societies, further secret elements were discussed38.",
