  "title": "\"Magnetic Anesthesia & Chloroform: Revolutionizing Surgical Procedures\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the incredible abilities of magnetized individuals to diagnose and prescribe remedies for diseases with striking accuracy, even without prior knowledge or training. The author explains that the magnetized person can even provide detailed descriptions of internal diseases and predict their duration. Moreover, this is achievable without seeing the patient, either through mental contact or by merely holding a lock of hair. Remarkably, the magnetized person can read any text placed on their head or abdomen, even while being blindfolded. In this concluding part, we learn more about the phenomena surrounding magnetized individuals and the sensations they experience.",
  "content": "If he is absent, a lock of his hair is merely approximated to the hand of the magnetized individual, the latter tells what it is without looking at it, also to whom the hair belongs, where the person from whom the hair came is at the present moment, what he is doing; and with respect to his disease, she gives all the information above-mentioned, and that with as much accuracy as if a post mortem had been made. Lastly, the magnetized person does not see by her eyes. She may be blindfolded, and she will read anything whatever, even without knowing how to read a book or manuscript, which shall have been placed open or closed, either on her head or on her abdomen. It is from this region also that her words seem to come.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the discovery of chloroform may have hindered the diffusion of Magnetism, it revolutionized the field of medicine by providing patients with pain relief during surgical procedures. Animal magnetism allowed patients to undergo operations while in a state of calmness and relaxation, making the process less traumatic and more comfortable."
