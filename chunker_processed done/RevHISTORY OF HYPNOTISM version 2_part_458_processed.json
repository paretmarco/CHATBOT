  "title": "What is the Significance of Mesmerism and the Transfer of Vital Energy in Esdaile's Experiments?",
  "first_phrase": "In this fascinating essay on mesmerism and the power of suggestion, author Arthur Conan Doyle explores the work of James Esdaile, an early pioneer of hypnosis in the mid-19th century. Esdaile believed that there was a transfer of vital energy from hypnotist to subject, which could be used to induce local determinations of the nervous energy to various parts of the body, leading to states of insensibility or rigidity. He also speculated on the role of electricity in these processes, and the possibility that humans possess a modification of the same power as electric fish.",
  "content": "He said:- \"In the actual state of science, we are entitled to say that a continual electro-magnetic action is going on in our organs by the contact of the arterial blood with its containing tissues-by its transfusion into venous blood which returns again to the lungs to combine with the oxygen of the air. We know that two different substances cannot come into contact without electricity being evolved, and that all chemical actions, whether analysis or synthesis, set at liberty a certain portion of electric fluid. If the electric fish can secrete electricity, and project it in the direction desired by its will, why should not men possess a modification of the same power? \"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the idea of humans possessing a modification of the power to secrete and project electricity rests on the belief that mesmeric influence is a physical power. This theory has been proven by the circumstances attending the first case and subsequent observations, and we must discard imagination and fascination as inadequate explanations for these effects."
