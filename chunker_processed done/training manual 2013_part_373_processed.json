  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the use of physical light to enhance human development has been discussed. In this final part, the focus is on the different traditions using light as a physiological aid, whereby fires, candles, and lamps are employed as facilitators for man's evolution. The text explains the ancient Zoroastrian practice of praying by gazing at fire and highlights the neurological changes brought about by reflected light that leads to greater perception and reception of energies. The author mentions a secret behind this practice, which modern science has yet to reveal. The relevance of light to creativity is also stressed.",
  "content": "The reflected life brings about a neurological change in the inner core of a person, and a more attentive perception of the “diaphanous”, that is, the development of the receptive and perceptive polarity of energies. There are several traditions regarding man’s development which employ light as a physiological aid, in the form of fires, candles, lamps, etc. The ancient Zoroastrians, for example, used to pray by gazing at the fire. We are allowed to believe that they were proceeding along an important path. There is a secret behind their practice, one which reaches us from the most ancient times, and which modern science has yet to thoroughly study and disclose. What is certain is that light excites the neuron to its maximum extent (at least with regard to the visual part). Recent researches likewise confirm the fact that, by utilizing light, we might engender a state of evolution of creativity. Physical light is thus A FACILITATING AID, and it “multiplies” what is found in the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the use of light in our daily practices can have a profound impact on our neurological development and enhance our perceptions of the world around us. From ancient traditions to modern research, the benefits of utilizing light as a facilitating aid to boost creativity and expand our consciousness are increasingly being recognized. Whether it's through candles, lamps or fires, we can tap into the power of light to unlock our full potential and experience a more fulfilling life."
