  "title": "What is Mesmerism and how did James Esdaile achieve great success in using it during surgical operations in India?",
  "first_phrase": "In this excerpt, James Esdaile describes an experiment where girls were subjected to pain-induced tests while in a state of somnambulism. Several gentlemen present witnessed the effects, which were extraordinary. The girls appeared to be completely unaware of the pain inflicted upon them while under hypnosis. Any suggestion of deception was quickly dismissed. Such experiments provide valuable insight into the unknown powers and susceptibilities of the human body.",
  "content": "Of course we cannot say how far training might have perfected the girls in the part they played, if it was acting; but, to say nothing of the character of Dr. Elliotson, and the securities which the publicity of the hospital affords against any such practices, the appearance and manner of the subjects experimented upon forbids the supposition that such was the case. It would seem that there are powers and susceptibilities in the human frame yet undeveloped, and whose existence is hardly suspected; and whatever may be the opinion formed by any one of the absolute worth of these trials, they cannot deny but that they open out a new and interesting chapter in human nature. With these speculations we have, however, nothing to do for the present. We went as spectators, and our business is merely to give a faithful narration of what we saw. James Esdaile.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, James Esdaile's pioneering use of Mesmerism in India opened up new and interesting possibilities in our understanding of human nature. While the experiments may be controversial, they demonstrated the existence of an inherent healing power in humans. Esdaile's success in using Mesmerism for pain-free surgical operations also earned him the well-deserved title of \"Great Mesmeriser.\""
