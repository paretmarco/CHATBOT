  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explained the history and importance of fascinations and mesmerism. This last section explores the relationship between mesmerismus © and other techniques such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and quantum techniques. The author mentions that while NLP might complement mesmerismus ©, they have different approaches. Mesmerismus © focuses on developing all five channels to gain access to the sixth sense, while NLP focuses on a dominant channel. Additionally, the text introduces NLP 3, a discipline developed by Dr. Paret, which is based on quantum principles and is practical for organization and relationship consulting. The author sheds light on how mesmerismus © fits into the broader context of modern techniques and sciences.",
  "content": "In order to attain results, the focus must stay on mastering one’s own energy. In actual fact, the mesmeric practitioner hypnotizes himself with a view to hypnotizing the person he is dealing with. Students that have a specific interest can even go further. They can be admitted to an ancient and very secret hermetic tradition of self development with Egyptian origins. So they can prosecute the Path and attain higher levels not only on their subjects, but even on themselves . What is the relationship between mesmerismus © and Neuro-Linguistic Programming? Neuro-Linguistic Programming might be complementary to our discipline, but the departure point is different. Neuro-Linguistic Programming is founded on the concept of a “dominant channel”, whereas magnetism, being the way of gaining access to the sixth sense, to the so-called quintessence, to true intuition and magnetic strength, can only emerge after one has equally developed the other five channels. In other seminars we present a discipline that goes beyond classical NLP, called NLP 3 and was conceived by dr. Paret. It is very practical for organization and relationship consulting. It is based on quantum principles and on a central direction of development What is the relationship between mesmerismus © and quantum techniques?",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating mesmerismus into verbal hypnosis can enhance one's ability to master their own energy and develop their sixth sense, leading to even more profound results. The utilization of magnetism can complement verbal techniques, tapping into the power of intuition and creating a deeper connection with the subject that extends beyond mere words."
