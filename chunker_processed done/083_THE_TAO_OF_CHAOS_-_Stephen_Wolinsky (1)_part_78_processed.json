  "title": "\"The Mandelbrot Set and Parallel Worlds: Exploring the Nature of Emptiness and Order\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the idea that the entire universe and its exquisite order can be revealed by making things smaller and smaller. This concept was discovered by Mandelbrot through his exploration of the fractal patterns. Moving forward, the author delves into the idea of an organizing self and how we define ourselves in a parallel world. In the last 200 tokens, the author talks about how each parallel world is made of the condensation of emptiness and how we are the condensation and thinning out of space as a pulsation. The author also mentioned the Taoist philosophy of energy and its relationship with this concept.",
  "content": "There is, however, an illusion of time (see Chapter 7: Time), that makes it appear as though we are always present. This illusion of connection from one world to another without the space is an appearance. The fact is we appear and disappear and define ourselves in an ever changing view, who we are is how we have defined (boundaried) ourselves and our not-self at any given moment. There is not one observer, but an infinite number (discussed in Chapter 23: Advanced Attention Training). Emptiness and Parallel Worlds It can be said that each parallel world is made of a condensation of emptiness (See Chapter 5: Space). This means that how we define ourself as ourself is a parallel world composed of condensed emptiness. This condensed emptiness appears as though it is always present when it actually condenses and is thinned out. This means we are the condensation and thinning out of space as a pulsation. In the Taoist philosophy of China, energy is termed ch'i: condensed emptiness which forms a parallel world and then returns to emptiness. \"When the ch'i condenses its visibility becomes apparent so that there are then the shapes of individual things.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our perception of time and connection is an illusion that leads us to define ourselves based on constantly changing boundaries. We exist as a pulsation of condensed emptiness that forms parallel worlds, and as we allow ourselves to see thoughts and emotions as part of this emptiness, we can better understand our place in the universe. Try the Tao of Chaos Exercise #5 to experience this for yourself."
