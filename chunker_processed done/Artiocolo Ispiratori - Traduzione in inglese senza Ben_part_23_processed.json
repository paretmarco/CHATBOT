  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve into the concept of entanglement in modern quantum physics that could explain why the impact of successful collaboration between people can be even stronger. We bring in the name of Maitre Philippe de Lyon, one of the greatest healers of all times, who collaborated with the famous Durville brothers in their Lyon school of magnetism. The Master emphasized on the inner attitude's value and its role in healing sick patients, and his courses were attended by both healthy individuals and sick patients who were treated and cured in the presence of his disciples.",
  "content": "He inter alia chaired the Durville brothers’ Lyon school of magnetism, and exercised a far-reaching influence on French magnetism. His courses were primarily addressed to those loyal listeners eager to heal sick patients. The Master attributed the highest value to one’s inner attitude: If it was lacking, then every attempt to cure sick people by magnetism would prove impervious to technique. The courses were also attended by some sick persons. They would be treated and cured during them, in the presence of his disciples, exactly as it would happen in the course of normal healing sessions.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the teachings of M. Philippe emphasize the importance of one's inner attitude when practicing magnetism for healing, prioritizing love, connection, forgiveness, intention, acceptance, and the release of emotional burdens. By embodying these qualities, practitioners can achieve exceptional therapeutic results and offer healing to others."
