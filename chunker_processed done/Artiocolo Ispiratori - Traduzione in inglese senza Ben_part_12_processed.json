  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve deeper into the technical aspects of magnetism and how it can facilitate the unblocking of energy points. The concept of \"poles\" or specific bodily points where energy can flow properly and harmonious ideas can be incorporated is explored. This approach differs from traditional psychological methodologies in that it does not directly involve the conscious mind. The subject experiences an increase in energy and well-being once the problem is resolved, and these points are viewed as gateways to this quantum-level healing. The discussion references Mesmer's school and how these points may coincide with important nerves and glands.",
  "content": "That is due to the fact that we operate at a level which is not directly linked to the conscious mind. We can see the bodily points where we experience the emotion as the “trapping point” of energy, or even, by utilizing an alternative set of terms, as the point in which the emotion becomes absorbed into the body and lives inside it. In quantum point of view these points are gateway to a The moment the problem is overcome, the subject feels an increase in energy and well-being. Let us now examine some technical aspects of such magnetism. Mesmer’s school used to speak of “poles”, which represented specific points in the body with an intrinsic capacity to facilitate energy to be unblocked and flow properly, as well as to help the process of incorporation, that is, the entry by harmonious ideas in the totality of the body. In a physiological perspective we found many times in these point some important nerves or glands.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and utilizing our bodily points as gateways to deeper levels of energy and consciousness, we can not only overcome problems and increase our well-being, but also shift our awareness and perception. The epigastrium, in particular, plays a crucial role in this process, as it hosts our \"second brain.\" Through these techniques, we can tap into a whole new realm of understanding and potential for personal growth."
