  "first_phrase": "This text is part of a bigger piece on physical exercise and its benefits to the body and mind. In this section, the author gives instructions on how to do a particular exercise that involves swinging the right and left arms in a circular motion, then touching the floor with a clenched fist. The exercise is meant to be done after meals and with perfect rhythm. The author emphasizes the importance of correct breathing and a hip movement to avoid bending the knees. The text concludes by stating that regular exercise leads to physical and mental improvement, such as reducing flabby cheeks, developing a perfect bust, neck, face, arms, and chest, and assuring perfect health, normal brain function, and a living soul.",
  "content": "Of course, by this time you will have learned that you cannot be harnessed into corsets, bustles, and other unsightly trappings which act as impediments to your easy and graceful movements. By the development of body and mind all the deficiencies that seem a disgrace to you, all crippled and deformed conditions which suggest the use of some of the many deceptions in vogue to hide them from public gaze, will be brought to a normal state by natural means. You will not only reduce those protruding abdomens and flabby cheeks, but will develop the bust, neck, face, arms and chest into their perfect form and beauty, besides assuring to yourself perfect health, a clear and unbiased mind, normal brain conditions, and a living soul to again place you in a position to enjoy the proper attitude of life. This exercise is to be done after meals; that is, when meals have been taken. If no meals are eaten, so much the better.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating these exercises into your daily routine will not only improve your physical appearance but also promote overall health, mental clarity, and refined taste. Follow these exercises daily, and they will help you overcome any unhealthy habits, leading to a more fulfilling and enjoyable life."
