  "title": "\"How to Establish Contact with the Subconscious through Ideomotor Finger Signals\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore how to establish contact with the subconscious mind using an ideomotoric signal, particularly the finger-raising response. But before delving into that, we repeated a phrase to synchronize the breathing with the speaking and establish a trance state. It is essential to get a proper response from the subconscious mind to ensure successful hypnosis. Now that we have established contact, we can begin the therapeutic process.",
  "content": "One of the most popular ways to prove if communication with the subconscious has been established is though the use of ideomotoric finger signals, and this we will use for our Hypnosleep induction. To elicit a response from the subconscious, whisper the following to the subject: “Raise the finger I am touching if you can hear me” or “I am now going to touch one of your fingers. Raise it if you can hear me”, depending if you have already taken appropriate action or not. Normally I would recommend you to make understood, in advance, that you are going to touch one finger of the subject, since a kinaesthetic stimulus is always a potential interference to the building of trance when the listener does not expect it. You will not need to apply any pressure when touching. Repeat the phrase at least three times. If you get no ideomotoric response, then repeat the procedure again all the way from “You can hear me…” until you get the desired response. Once the finger raises, you have established contact with the subconscious mind and the subject is verified to be in a Hypnosleep trance state. Where do we go from here?",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, Ideomotoric finger signals are a powerful tool to establish communication with the subconscious mind, and they can be used effectively in Hypnosleep induction. By repeating the suggestion pattern, you can verify the trance state and then proceed with hand levitation before giving any further suggestions. Once you have accessed the deep state, you can easily \"anchor\" it for future use. So, enjoy the process and explore the vast potential of the subconscious mind."
