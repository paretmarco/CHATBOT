  "title": "What Makes Esdaile's Mesmerism Unique Compared to Modern Hypnosis?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learn about Esdaile, a hypnotist who was a specialist in Mesmerism. He believed that he could transfer vital or nervous energy to his patients to induce certain effects. He also believed that there was an influence that passes from one person to another during mesmerism. He could even induce local determinations of nervous energy to various parts of the body. In this following text, we will delve deeper into his beliefs surrounding mesmerism and explore his thoughts on the electrical explanation of these phenomena.",
  "content": "Again:- \"From all I have seen, I cannot but believe that there is an influence of some kind that passes from one person to another, when one of the two is mesmerised in the way I have described; that, in fact, there is a virtual transfusion of some vital agent from one body to the other.\" Of this vital or nervous energy, he says:- \"The mesmeriser can not only saturate the system of the patient, generally, with his own nervous fluid, but when his patient becomes very considerably under his influence can induce local determinations of the nervous energy to various parts, so as to place them, for the time, beyond the patient's volition, even while he retains his general consciousness. This will perhaps explain the phenomenon of local rigidity, and the insensibility of individual members of the body when the rest of the system is unaffected.\" Like a great many magnetisers of every epoch, Esdaile was inclined to adopt an electrical explanation of the phenomena.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile believed that there is a transfer of vital or nervous energy from the mesmerizer to the patient, which can explain the phenomenon of local rigidity and insensibility. He also saw an electrical explanation to the phenomena, and thought that humans might possess a modification of the same power as electric fish. This knowledge could provide new insights into the mesmerizing process and may benefit future research in the field."
