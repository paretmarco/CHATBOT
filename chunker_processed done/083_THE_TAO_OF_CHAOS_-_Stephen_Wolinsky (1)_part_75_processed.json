  "title": "Parallel Worlds: Exploring the Phenomenon Within Ourselves",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the concept of parallel worlds and their existence within ourselves. The previous paragraphs have discussed the merging of energies and memories between parallel worlds, creating a chain of associations. The author uses the example of vacation and traumatic experiences to illustrate how different parallel worlds can exist side-by-side. This section delves deeper into the idea of parallel worlds and their impact on our personalities. The author explains how different schools of psychology have different names for these parallel worlds, such as parts, sub-personalities or ego states. The unifying aspect of emptiness is also introduced, linking the different parts of ourselves through their shared existence in parallel worlds.",
  "content": "You might say that, like a wire plugs into a socket, you experience the energy of a world that you plug into. Parallel Worlds and Internal Reality Appreciating that in the sky we have boundaries around planets and stars separated by space, so, too, parallel worlds inside of us possess the same phenomena. From the point of view of a personality, it can be said that we are all composed of parallel worlds or, in psychology jargon, parts of ourselves. Each world which some people call roles, parts, sub-personalities, I-dentities, false selves, ego states, or schemas. Different schools of psychology have different names for these parallel worlds. What we are adding here is the unifying aspect of emptiness. Each part of our \"personality\" has different feelings, thoughts, memories, etc. For example, when you are at work, the world of independence and decision making is the one you operate from. In this world view, you take charge and get and react according to what business decision needs to be made. In the world of spouse you feel vulnerable, dependent, and indecisive about what to do in your relationship.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of parallel worlds within us can help us navigate the different parts of our personalities and how we interact with the world. Fractals and the unifying aspect of emptiness can help us find underlying order amidst chaos, and expand our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world."
