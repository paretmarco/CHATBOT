  "title": "\"Magnetism as a Cure for Scrofula: A Miraculous Recovery\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author describes how magnetism helped a poor girl suffering from a festering limb and scrofulous matter. The girl, previously operated upon, pointed out the means of healing the wounds on the arm and breast, which proved successful. However, the most crucial part was changing her constitution to prevent recurrence. In this final part, the author recounts the girl's prediction that on the 24th of August, at nine in the evening, she would fall into a state of profound sleep that would last for thirty hours. The girl also warned that she might attempt to eat her own flesh and requested that she be continuously monitored.",
  "content": "She pointed out the means of healing the wounds on the arm and breast, and on these being applied they proved completely successful. The most important thing, however, remained to be effected, which was to change her constitution, or at least to modify it in such a manner as to prevent a recurrence of the previous eruptions. Magnetism had produced a sufficient, degree of lucidity to allow of her giving advice to other patients, but hitherto not enough to describe the means of curing herself. One day, as she was prescribing for a patient whose recovery she was anxious to bring about, she interrupted the consultation, and told me that on the 24th of August, at nine in the evening, she should fall into a state of profound sleep, which would last for thirty hours; that this sleep would be very calm, if during the two preceding days she were not annoyed by anything; but otherwise she should be much agitated; and that, by an unaccountable feeling, she should endeavour to eat her own flesh. She therefore desired that precautions might be taken to check this fatal propensity, and requested that she might be incessantly watched.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the patient's ability to prescribe cures and predict her own recovery is a remarkable testament to the power of magnetism. While her physical wounds were successfully treated, the ultimate goal of modifying her constitution remained to be seen. However, with her clear articulation of the impending thirty-hour sleep, during which the scrofulous matter would be purged from her system, there is reason to hope for a complete recovery. As always, it is important to take heed of the advice of medical professionals and ensure that proper precautions are taken during any such medical crises."
