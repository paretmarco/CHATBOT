  "content": "The modern world is saturated with a plethora of social conventions, and no one can really attempt to make a loud confession of the feelings that are dearest to his heart, or give voice to the aspirations buried in his innermost being. Even though a person might wish to love and be loved, he can often do nothing other than reconciling himself to a state of wait. There is, however, a magical tool of communication, a hidden accomplice: The look, the silent lamp in oneâ€™s eyes. The eye caresses, the eye invites, the eye promises, exasperates desire and vanity, and is capable of throwing one into despair or suddenly thrusting one back to the pinnacle of human joy. Through the look, we communicate ourselves and our idiosyncractic reality. It is in our look that the person facing us discerns the truth of who we are and where we are heading for.",

The eyes have long been revered as the symbol of knowledge and the key to understanding oneself and others. Whether through the left eye, the right eye, or the central eye, the ability to communicate through this precious sensory organ remains an integral part of the human experience."
