  "title": "\"Exploring the Potential of Quantum Approach in Deep Hypnotic States\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this article, we delve into the topic of deep hypnotic states and their capabilities. Prior to this, we discussed the keys to reaching states such as Esdaile State, Hypnosleep, and Deep Somnambulism. An example of an experiment by Swiss magnetizer Lafontaine was also shared, showcasing the state of catalepsy induced by non-verbal techniques. Now, we explore the purpose behind accessing deep hypnosis, which involves reaching a space beyond the ego and accessing a deeper dimension of being, also known as \"the implicate level\" in quantum terms. Doing so can result in spontaneous or faster healings, as the subject is free from material constraints.",
  "content": "Quantum approach and deep hypnotic states. Keys for Esdaile State, Hypnosleep and Deep Somnambulism. The drawing above reports an example of one of the experiments of the swiss magnetizer Lafontaine. It is a particular state of catalepsy. This state can be induced in most people in less than five minutes, by using the non verbal techniques of the gaze and of the passes. What are deep hypnotic states useful for? Deep states are very useful as they will bring your client to another dimension of being where he will feel his entanglement with the universe in a different way. He will often feel transformed after returning from this wonderful state. In deep hypnosis we use an approach which is different from the techniques of hypnotherapy, where we use the wiring of our ego, and reframe our behavior. In the deep states of hypnosis we reach a level where we access a space before the ego, and are in connection with a deeper dimension of being, with what in quantum terms we would call “the implicate level”. When reaching these levels, we can have spontaneous healings or faster healings. This is due to the fact that the subject will be in a specific state and freer from material constraints.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, deep hypnotic states can unlock a person's connection to a deeper dimension of being, beyond the constraints of their ego and conditioning. This state can lead to spontaneous healings and a deeper understanding of the self, making it a valuable tool in hypnotherapy. By learning the keys to inducing Esdaile State, Hypnosleep, and Deep Somnambulism, hypnotherapists can provide transformative experiences for their clients."
