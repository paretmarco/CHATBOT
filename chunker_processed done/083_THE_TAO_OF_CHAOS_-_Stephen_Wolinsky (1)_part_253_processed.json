  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Premature Observation and Its Implications\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text elaborate on the concept of premature observation, which is a defense mechanism adopted by schizoid individuals against feeling. The author cites the observations of several theorists like Palmer, Riso, and Naranjo to describe the fixation strategy of observers/thinkers that confuses thoughts with feelings, leading to detachment from their own emotions and bodily experiences. This attitude is often mistaken as being spiritual by others, leading to a false sense of identity and inability to connect with people. The text explains in detail how this fixation strategy is used as a reaction against the trauma of loss of being, leading to premature evacuation.",
  "content": "This strategy of the observer/personality dyad looks spiritual and is called the Unenlightened Buddha, because ideas and thoughts are mistaken as experiences. In other words, they think experience rather than having experiences. This observer/personality dyad reacts internally to a fear of being engulfed, and imagines people want from them, even if they do not. Needs are not felt and often spiritualized2, with an unacknowledged fear. All of this leads the person to detach prematurely without the ability to connect with others. In other words, their premature observation is a reaction against feeling the fear of the trauma of loss of being. Hence it is premature evacuation. In other words, they act \"as if,\" they are connected or pretend so that others will not see their emptiness. This lack of feeling is labeled spiritual and often times they think, and others around them think, they are spiritual and meditating, when actually they are terrified and medicating. See Chapter 14, Spiritual- ' See Chapter 3, Quantum Consciousness: Volume I, Is It Dissociation or Observation?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Unenlightened Buddha strategy of the observer/personality dyad can lead to a premature detachment and a lack of ability to connect with others due to a deep-seated fear of loss and emptiness. It is crucial to recognize and feel our experiences rather than spiritualize them or accumulate things to fill an inner void, which can lead us down a path of avarice and disconnection."
