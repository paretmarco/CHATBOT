  "first_phrase": "This fascinating text explores the symbolism of alchemical painting, investigating its context and the fears it provoked among those who saw it. The author highlights the role of man as a mediator between the abstract and the concrete, emphasizing the essential bond of sympathy between the master and the workers. The Pelican is presented as a symbol of selfless charity, without which even brilliant intelligence and will would be useless. The text concludes by describing the Triangle of Solomon as the ultimate reward for those who become elevated by virtue of emotion and science, beyond compare in its power and symbolic significance.",
  "content": "They symbolise the union of the Father and the Mother, of God and Nature, of the single Spirit and the universal Soul, of procreative Fire and life-giving Water. It is the pentacle beyond compare, the symbol of power that nothing can resist, and that we will possess if we do indeed reach the grade of Master. APPENDIX A disconcerting Symbolism An alchemical Painting A Disconcerting Symbolism Investigating the context of an alchemical painting which was displayed for a long time in a church for the edification of the disciples, and which later provoked fears that it was a wicked work of art created by the Freemasons. The Courrier de la Champagne was a newspaper that habitually attacked Freemasonry in the province of Champagne, and on the 26th of January 1907 it received the following letter, which it published without delay: â€œTo the Editor, I consider it my duty to call the attention of your colleague, Father Curieux, to a painting that would be of great interest to the cause of demonstrating the hypocrisy of Freemasonry and its persistently antireligious aims, beneath the cloak of most fervent religion. Some years ago this painting was still hanging on display in the Church of Saint Maurice in Reims.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical painting in question presents a rich and complex symbolism that evokes the union of opposite forces and the attainment of spiritual mastery. While it may have been misinterpreted as a work of the Freemasons, its true meaning lies in its representation of the ultimate symbol of power and transcendence, the pentacle beyond compare."
