  "title": "\"The Power of Fascination in Overcoming Mental Mechanisms\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of Fascination was explored, which refers to a state where an individual is captivated beyond their ego consciousness. This state can be induced through various means, including ocular manipulation or personal mental mechanisms. The author further proposes two ways of proceeding with healing therapies: one involving contacting the symptoms directly (\"curing through the symptom\") and the other, where healers use the crisis as a cure. This final part emphasizes the efficacy and swiftness of following the second method.",
  "content": "By means of the look, we thus intervene in the very mechanisms which produce the “fascination” by means of ideas or concepts that beset the subject via these mechanisms themselves. There is yet another way of proceeding: This second method consists in contacting the symptoms directly. The process is termed by some people “curing through the symptom”. Through the patient’s total concentration on his symptom, in fact, we can carve out a path allowing us to speak to that part of the brain which generates such a symptom. We thereby give effect to a mechanism which some healers have already resorted to, namely, \"utilizing the crisis as a cure\" 12. What at that point facilitates the efficacy and, in particular, the rapidity of the process, is the re-enactment of the problem itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, there are alternative methods to intervene in the mechanisms that produce fascination and achieve rapid results, such as curing through the symptom. By re-enacting the symptom and then reaching a state of \"void,\" we can uproot traumas and erase traces of negative memories without the need for drugs. These practices have been successfully demonstrated by healers and researchers alike, providing a practical approach for individuals seeking relief from symptoms or traumas."
