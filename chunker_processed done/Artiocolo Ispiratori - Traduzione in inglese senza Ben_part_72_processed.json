  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve deeper into the technique used by Campanelli, which has had varying degrees of success on different people. Through our courses, you can gain insight into this method, which becomes more effective with practice. Testimonials speak of the simplicity of the method, which involves pressing hands on specific areas of the body to help \"cure\" habits such as smoking in a single session. This technique's workings may be mysterious, but as many assert, it certainly works.",
  "content": "Other people have this to say: The advocate “cures” the habit of smoking in a single session which lasts 50 seconds (In reality, the whole process consumes 10 minutes), during which he touches the client with his hands on the nape, the neck, and, repeatedly, the sternum. The method is simple: He forces his hands on the head for 10 seconds, and follows that up by forcing them for 40 seconds along the client’s arms. No magic formulas or esoteric expressions are involved. There is no reason for it to cause any harm. The suggestion is nothing, although it might possibly play the role of making that appointment so as to justify a purpose. “I am still unable to give myself an explanation as to how it takes place, but the truth is that it works. I touch the patient on his head and arms for forty seconds: I apply a simple pressure, after which the habit is gone”.",
  "last_phrase": "If you are looking to quit smoking, you may want to consider this 10-minute method which involves the application of pressure on the head and arms. Although it sounds simple, testimonials prove its effectiveness. Don't let smoking control your life any longer, give this method a chance and free yourself from this unhealthy habit."
