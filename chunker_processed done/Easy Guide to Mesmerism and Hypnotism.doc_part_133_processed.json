  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discusses the importance of health and self-development for a mesmerist. Now, in the final 200 tokens, the author delves into the means by which mesmerists direct their influence, including tools like \"the gaze,\" \"passes\" made in contact or at a distance, and breathing or blowing. The author emphasizes that these tools can be easily cultivated and should be treated as vehicles for conveying something from the operator to the subject. The best time to cultivate \"the gaze\" is in the morning, when the brain is rested and energized.",
  "content": "But if, in addition to the foregoing, they have those faculties which tend to timidity, lack of concentration, want of courage, as far as will is concerned, they would not make mesmerists at all. The basic tools for directing the influence The means used by Mesmerists for directing the mesmeric influence are “the gaze”; by “passes,” which are made “in contact”; and “at distance,” and are “local” in character or '“general”; by “breathing or blowing.” Now these can be easily cultivated. In cultivating them it must be remembered they are not only the pantomime language of the will, but that they are vehicles to convey something from the operator to the subject. At least let the mesmeriser act as if such were the case. To cultivate “the gaze” the best time is in the morning, when the brain is rester, the mind clear and refreshed, and all the energies alive and wide-awake. When a person is wearied or exhausted, the attempt to cultivate the gaze would probably end in sleep—Auto-Mesmerism or Hypnotism.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, mesmerism relies on the operator's ability to cultivate tools such as \"the gaze,\" \"passes,\" and \"breathing or blowing\" to direct mesmeric influence. These tools can be easily developed, and it is essential to remember that they are vehicles for conveying the operator's intention to the subject. Practicing \"the gaze\" in the morning, looking directly into someone's eyes while speaking with purpose, can greatly improve the success of mesmerism. So be confident and assertive in your gaze, and let your intention lead your mesmeric influence."
