The final 200 tokens delve into Esdaile's belief that Mesmerism should only be used in the case of illness, and the potential danger it poses when used on healthy individuals. Esdaile was critical of other magnetisers who used the technique too freely, while also promoting the idea that Mesmerism should be made available to everyone.",
  "content": "A nonentity, an unreal, though alleged, power of Nature can do no harm; but all real powers of Nature will work readily for evil if misapplied.\" In like manner Dr. Esdaile. in his \"Mesmerism in India,\" says:- \"People say to me, ‘I should like to ascertain if I can be mesmerised; do try.' I reply, ‘You very probably cannot; and I should as soon comply with your desire to feel the effects of opium as mesmerise you without a cause; when you need it you will probably be benefitted by it.' If Mesmerism be forced upon a person in a state of health it is very likely to do mischief; for any attempt to be better than 'well' is pretty sure to make one ill.\"21 He thought that Mesmerism should be known to everyone Esdaile, like all other medical magnetisers, is very severe on his own brethren for their treatment of Mesmerism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Mesmerism may offer potential benefits, it should not be taken lightly or used carelessly. It is important to seek the guidance of a qualified health professional with extensive knowledge in this area before engaging in any Mesmerism-related activities. Ultimately, understanding the limits and potential risks of this practice can help ensure a safe and beneficial experience."
