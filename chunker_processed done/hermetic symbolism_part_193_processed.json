  "title": "Interpreting Symbolism on a Ship: Meaning of Enigmatic Figures",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we are introduced to two mysterious characters on board the ship which represents the journey of the soul towards enlightenment. The Master of Life Force and the Hermit of the Tarot symbolize the forces that dominate the Corporeal Spirit and the Astral body, respectively. The numbers inscribed on the King's sceptre and crown remain an unsolved enigma. The alchemical symbol of the Globe of the World, with the Redeemer holding it, represents the universal spirit of all things evolving towards perfection.",
  "content": "In his right hand is a flowering hazel branch, and in the left two green hazelnuts that he offers without flinching to the dragon of elemental life. He is the Master of the Life Force (Prana or Jiva to the Buddhists), and as such, he dominates the Corporeal Spirit (Venus). He has the ability to expand life (the flowering branch) or to concentrate it (the fruits). In the middle of the boat is another old man dressed in black. In his left hand is an open book, with a tiny wooden hut standing over it. Here we have that knot of self upon which everything rests, which the Eastern occultists called the Astral body and the Buddhists call Linga Sharira. This character is none other than the Hermit of the Tarot (Arcanum IX), who is the same as Twashtri, the Carpenter of the Vedas, who has the task of constructing the astral shape, the Foundation (Yesod, 9th Sephira) of the physical organism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the characters in this mystical boat represent different aspects of human existence and inner work. The Master of the Life Force, the Hermit, Mars, and Hercules symbolize the control of Prana or Jiva, the construction of the astral body, the wise use of enthusiasm, and the service to the higher self. Together, they invite us to navigate the waters of self-discovery with courage and purpose."
