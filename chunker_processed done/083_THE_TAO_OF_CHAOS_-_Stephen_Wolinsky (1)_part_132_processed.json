  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we will explore the Tao of Chaos, an experiential exercise to understand the unification of energy and how it eliminates boundaries and unifies consciousness. Before this, the text highlights the idea that labeling energy as good or bad creates resistance to nothingness, which is a natural process that reorganizes energy patterns. The resistance to chaos makes individuals exist, and without labeling and defining, there would be no us. The conclusion brings George Harrison's words, \"All things must pass\" and underlines the idea that time is not just a given, but a concept that we must experience and understand.",
  "content": "This is seen by the I-dentity as chaos. Emptiness in a pulsation organizes and reorganizes into different energy patterns. Simply put, to resist is to exist; to de-label is to reorganize. Ultimately, however, existence is nonexistence and nonexistence is existence since they are made of the same substance. To allow this appearance and disappearance is the Tao of Chaos. Let's look at this experientially. Tao of Chaos Exercise #27 Step INotice a person that pushes your buttons. Step IINotice the observer that is looking at the person, and explaining why this person \"pushes your button.\" Step III Experience the person who pushes your button, and the observer who is explaining why this person \"pushes your button\" as being made of the same energy. Step IV Notice what happens. To conclude this section is to include the experience, that all \"external\" energy and \"internal\" energy are made of the same energy. This understanding of the unification of energy eliminates boundaries and unifies consciousness. This is the Tao of Chaos. ________________ All things must pass... All things must pass away... George Harrison T ime generally is considered to be a given, an automatic.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Tao of Chaos helps us realize that all energy is interconnected and eliminates boundaries, resulting in unified consciousness. Similarly, recognizing time's great illusion that all emotions will pass can help us stay present and reduce suffering in our lives. Remember, all things must pass."
