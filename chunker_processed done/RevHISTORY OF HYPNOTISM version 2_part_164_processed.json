  "title": "\"Magnetism: Developing Sensitivity and Inner Synergy for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author writes about the importance of recognizing and following the currents of magnetism in order to discover the root cause of a disease and aid the work of nature. In this final section, the author emphasizes that the higher results of magnetism can only be achieved by leveraging one's inner sensitivity. The Chevalier de Lausanne's method can be practiced with others, but the magnetizer must first enhance their sensitivity through careful observation and following intuition to create a powerful synergy with the client.",
  "content": "The currents conduct you to the part where the cause of the disease resides, they direct your action, they can even indicate to the physician the remedies to be employed to aid and favor the work of nature, excited by magnetism. It is almost useless to say that to observe the currents carefully, the magnetizer must be free from distraction; but it is well to remark, that when he has once habituated himself to being directed by them, he needs to make no effort of attention to follow them.” Editor’s note: It is almost clear how the higher results of magnetism are achievable only by developing an inner sensitivity. But as you uncover them, you will notice that magnetism is something that pertains to your very same Nature. It is something that has always been there and just needed to be reawakened Following your intuition will create a powerful synergy with your client and will make him sense deep rapport with you. This will be the basis for a powerful positive transformation. Enhancing your own sensitivity If you want to practice the method of the Chevalier de Lausanne with other people, begin by developing your own sensitivity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing your own sensitivity to magnetism is fundamental to effectively apply the Chevalier de Lausanne's method with others. By enhancing your intuition and attentively following the currents, you can create a powerful synergy with your clients that will be the basis for a positive transformation. Despite the divergent theories that have arisen since the discovery of magnetism, the importance of developing an inner sensitivity remains a central aspect of the practice."
