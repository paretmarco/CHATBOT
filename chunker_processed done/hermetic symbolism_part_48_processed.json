  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we dive into the patterns of constructive logic that underlie all hermetic symbolism, specifically focusing on the interrelations between Jupiter and Saturn. Before that, we learned that the symbols for Jupiter-Tin and Saturn-Lead can be found in Greek manuscripts. Jupiter, associated with the light and airy element, is considered frivolous, while Saturn is deemed the most serious of all gods. Saturnine Lead is the foundation for hermetists' art, which carries the potential for gold locked inside. The text concludes with how a wise man can set the wheels in motion for the transformation of the metal towards rejuvenation.",
  "content": "Jupiter Cross below the Crescent: Saturn Dominant Cross, above the Crescent Work towards spiritual transformation Change brought about passively, via action in the placid life force (The horizontal line of the Cross) Growth Development Movement towards embodiment Incarnation Creation or generation of physical life Animation Youth, Presumptuousness Life Transformative work done Change brought about actively via action in the active life force (The vertical line of the Cross) Disintegration Detainment, declination Decomposition Disincarnation Decrepitude Transformation Maturity, Experience Death Being a light metal, Jupiter’s tin correlates to the Air which is the breath of life, in contrast to the heaviness of Lead , which drags life down into the grave. But Jupiter’s lightness makes it frivolous, while Saturn is the most grave and serious of all the gods. The result was that the Saturnine Lead became the foundation for the hermetists’ art. This base metal carries the potential for Gold, locked away inside it. A Wise Man can set the wheels in motion for this transformation, as the metal is already mature and ripe for it, like an old man who is ready the for natural rejuvenation brought about by the alchemical process of dissolution of the body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical journey is one of spiritual transformation and growth, both passively and actively. The use of these transformative forces is symbolized by Jupiter's tin and Saturn's lead. The potential for gold lies locked within, awaiting the wise man's touch. Finally, the symbol of mercury holds the key to the ultimate secrets of the Great Art. May you find success in your journey towards enlightenment, transformation, and understanding."
