  "title": "\"Understanding the Body-Mind Connection in Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the underlying concept of the previous discussion is expounded upon by the author. Using therapist-client interaction, the author highlights how one can reach their inner essence through working with their defensive blocks. The author references Wilhelm Reich’s and Alexander Lowen’s body work in explaining how one's head, stomach, and pelvis could be areas of disturbance that defend against their unwanted I-dentity. The text ends with the last step highlighted, “Allow the energy to be reabsorbed back into Essence”. The case of Mary, a woman in her late thirties, is used as an example to illustrate the author's point.",
  "content": "Therapist: When you go home at night before you eat, what do you experience? Client: Aloneness. Therapist: Where in your body do you feel it? Client: In my stomach. Therapist: And where in your body do you feel the obsession about planning a future? Client: In my head. Therapeutic Note Here we have three areas of disturbance; the head, the stomach, and the pelvis. Although each area defends against an unwanted I-dentity, there is only one Essence. Therefore, no matter which emptiness we enter, we can reach the same inner Essence. In this case, I decided to work from the head down. I thought of this because of the body work of Wilhelm Reich, M.D. The body, according to Reich, is divided into seven segments or defensive blocks he calls body armor, i.e., eyes, jaw, throat, chest, solar plexus, stomach, and pelvis. Alexander Lowen, M.D. added the arms and legs. Reich traditionally worked from the eye segment downward with the belief the most powerful energy or quanta was in the pelvis, which acts like a bifurcation point.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding the body's defensive blocks and working from the head down, therapists can help clients uncover their inner essence, even in areas of disturbance such as loneliness and obsession. Peeling back layers of obsessive identity can reveal deeper underlying issues that can be addressed in therapy."
