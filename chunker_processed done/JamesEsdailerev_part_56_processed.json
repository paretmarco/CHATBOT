  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the observations of De Puysegur and his successors on the ability of magnetized individuals to self-select the necessary treatment for their ailments, even seen in animals. Now, we delve into De Puysegur's practices, noting his honesty and focus on helping patients suffering from severe diseases, regardless of gender or social status. Notably, De Puysegur's magnetism treatment extended to animals, with the Comte de Puysegur healing a dog with magnetic passes. Finally, we explore the development of somnambulistic faculties, which played a vital role in De Puysegur's treatment.",
  "content": "There was no public exhibition, nothing was done to strike the imagination; there was no selection of subjects from among silly or melancholic women. The patients of the marquis were patients of both sexes of the peasant class, and were often suffering from severe and obstinate diseases. In fact this kind of treatment worked even on animals. Magnetism on Animals For example, the Comte de Puységur, brother of the Marquis de Puységur, was second in command of the Regiment of Languedoc when he practiced animal magnetism to heal a dog which had been injured by an angry soldier. The Comte de Puységur approached the animal, which seemed to be barely alive, and applied magnetic passes. The dog was restored to good health in the space of a few minutes. This seems to be one of the first examples in the literature of animal magnetism of the application of magnetic healing to an animal18. Even Deleuze observed that a dog that had been previously magnetized for some slight pains, came back, and by its demeanour seemed to require the same remedy.19 Developing the Somnambulistic Faculties.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism and somnambulism were two fascinating fields of study that showed the power of the human mind and its connection to the world around us. These phenomena were not just limited to humans but also worked successfully on animals, proving the effectiveness of magnetic passes. Magnetic ecstasy was another fascinating aspect that showcased the capability of the mind to transcend beyond conventional states of consciousness. These studies provide valuable insights into the nature of humanity and our inherent potential to heal ourselves and others."
