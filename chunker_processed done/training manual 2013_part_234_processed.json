  "first_phrase": "This text explores the role of focal and ambient vision, and how peripheral circular movements can affect body perception. Prior to this, the article explains how ambient vision plays a role in orienting individuals in their environment while focal vision is used for conscious actions. The last 200 tokens focus on Virgilio's method, which involves moving the hand in peripheral vision to affect sense of balance. This is linked to a complex of visual areas important for monitoring body position relative to gravity. Performing this exercise can prepare individuals for a more complete method of fascination.",

DIFFERENT METHODS TO FASCINATE USING PERIPHERAL MOVEMENTS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF BODY POSITION (Virgilio’s method) Moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can result in affecting the sense of balance. Different visual areas contribute to the processing of visual information coming from different parts of the visual field, and a complex of visual areas located along the banks of the interhemispheric fissure (a deep groove that separates the two brain hemispheres) has been linked to peripheral vision. It has been suggested that these areas are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery, and monitoring body position relative to gravity. (Palmer SM, Rosa MG (2006). \"A distinct anatomical network of cortical areas for analysis of motion in far peripheral vision\". Eur J Neurosci 24 (8): 2389–405. doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05113.x. PMID 17042793) This exercise is good to prepare a person to a more complete method of fascination.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating fascinating peripheral movements into your exercise routine may lead to improved balance and body position awareness. Try Virgilio’s method to prepare yourself for a more comprehensive approach in just four simple steps. Begin by putting your left hand on your right shoulder, followed by looking inside your left eye, pushing energy by squeezing your buttocks, and grounding yourself. Move your hand slowly to draw the subject's attention before proceeding to create attraction, issuing mental commands, and working on the left eye. Remember to saturate the right side to induce a trance state before moving on to the left."
