  "title": "\"The Liberating Power of Symbols: Exploring their Role in Independent Thinking\"",
  "first_phrase": "The power of symbols lies in their ability to awaken our dormant ideas and force us to uncover buried truths in our souls. However, for symbols to have an impact, the seed of the ideas they aim to germinate must already exist within us. This stands in stark contrast to the fixedness of dogmatic or scientific formulae, which can restrict thought. In this concluding section, the author highlights the importance of symbols in fostering independent and liberated thinking, as opposed to the tyranny of dogmatic indoctrination. The section emphasizes the vast difference between symbols and dogma and explains why initiations have used the former.",
  "content": "But from a philosophical point of view, precise formulae still correspond to fixed thought, held back and immobilised by artificial limits, which seems like death in comparison with the live, undefined thought, complex and mobile, that is reflected in symbols. These symbols are not designed to translate what we call scientific truths. By their very nature they must be elastic, vague and ambiguous like the declarations of the Oracles, whose role consisted of revealing mysteries, leaving the spirit wholly free to its path. In this sense, a whole abyss separates the symbol from the dogma. The dogma lends itself to tyrannical indoctrination, it is the instrument of a rigid and absolute intellectual discipline, which is just how churches, schools and sects also understand it. The symbol, on the other hand, favours independence over despotic orthodoxies. Therefore it is not so strange that all the various initiations have used symbols, because they and only they permit one to reach a truly liberated manner of thinking.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of symbols lies in their ability to stimulate our minds and lead us towards a more independent and liberated manner of thinking. They provide a way for us to understand the mysteries of life that cannot be expressed through precise formulae or dogmatic beliefs. To truly understand the occult knowledge, one must embark on a journey of supreme intelligence and internal reflection."
