  "content": "The goal is to be your own selves ... By observing yourselves in daily life with a sense of concern, with the intention of understanding instead of judging, plunged in a state of complete acceptance of whatever might emerge into view, accepting it, that is, for the mere reason that it is there, you will encourage what lies in your depths to surface and, thereby, you will enrich your life and your consciousness by the energies that the profound part of your selves encompasses. This is the great work of consciousness: Removing obstacles and releasing energies by grasping the nature of life and the nature of the mind. Intelligence is the gate to freedom, and reawakened attention is the progenitor of intelligence. Nisargadatta Maharaj, “I Am That”. Exercises on the focal point Exercise 2: The focal point. You should imagine a point, a small point in front of you. Make it as small as possible, and then concentrate on it for some ten seconds. We are going to call this a “focal point”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing self-observation with a sense of understanding, accepting what emerges into view, and removing obstacles to release energies, we can enrich our consciousness and ultimately achieve freedom. Use the exercises of focusing on a focal point and projecting it onto yourself in the mirror to begin your journey towards self-discovery. \"I am now going to embark on the path to my own self.\""
