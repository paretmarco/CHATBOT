  "first_phrase": "In this section, the masonic text delves deeper into the Companionship stage of the Great Work, following the completion of Salt purification during the Apprenticeship. The Apprentice's constant activity and fiery Sulphur F are tested, leading to the fiery Chamber of Companions with its red ceiling. This represents an individual's sphere of activity measured by their sulphurous radiation and is a mechanism of enlightenment. The initiation of the individual vests in the internal Fire, and they learn to feed it properly, stoking it up to vanquish surrounding obstacles.",
  "content": "In these circumstances, red is without doubt the best colour for the Apprentice himself, and even more so for the J. column, which he must approach in order to be received as a Companion. The Lodge of the first grade, however, should be furnished all in blue, as it represents the Universe in all its boundless immensity. The Chamber of the Companion, with its red ceiling, represents a far more restricted kingdom: our individual sphere of activity measured by the magnitude of our sulphurous radiation. This radiation engenders a sort of refractive medium, that reflects the diffuse ambient light and concentrates it on the subjectâ€™s spiritual core. This is the mechanism of enlightenment, which benefits those who have seen the brilliance of the Shining Star. The Initiation of the individual becomes the vestal virgin to this internal Fire, the Origin of all individuality. He knows how to keep it alive as it lies under the ashes, later he learns how to feed it properly, and finally he stokes it up so that it vanquishes the obstacles that surround it and that try to reduce it to isolation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the colors used in the Masonic Lodge hold symbolic significance, representing different aspects of the universe and individual journey. The mechanism of enlightenment, fueled by the internal Fire, helps the Initiate communicate with the Collective and become a Worker or Companion. Once we have purified ourselves, it is then time to act on the external world and continue the journey towards greater wisdom and understanding."
