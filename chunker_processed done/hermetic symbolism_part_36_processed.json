  "title": "\"The Symbolic Meaning of Salt and Nitre\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses Salt as a symbol of wisdom and the stabilizing foundation of all bodies. It is extracted from the salt marshes, and once crystallized, turned into the body of the Stone of the Sages. Philosophers dedicated it to the Celestial Virgin. Now, the author introduces Nitre as a fundamentally unstable substance representing every rebellion in history. It contrasts with the constructive stability of Salt and has been known as Hell's Salt since the invention of explosives. Intense!",
  "content": "Subject to this dual influence, the nascent cosmos becomes separate from the Nothing; but the basis of its construction rests on two distinctive constructive elements, traditionally represented by two columns that rise up tall like menhirs or obelisks. The men who built the Temple of King Solomon bowed to this tradition, the entrance to the building being flanked by the two columns called Jakin and Bohas. For the hermetists, Chaos was interrupted by the separation of the subtle from the dense, which spawned the creation of Heaven and of Earth, the first act of the Biblical genesis. But the Creator’s plan for unity persists even when faced with the infinite variety of things. Therefore everything that exists has its own heaven and earth, which is what the symbol Salt represents. Nitre The constructive stability of Salt, the foundation of all geological sediments and of the most stable rocks, is contrasted by a fundamentally unstable substance represented by Nitre , which has been known as Hell’s Salt ever since the invention of explosives. This is not the symbol of calm wisdom, but the graphic representation of every rebellion in history, starting with that of Lucifer12.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbolic columns of Jakin and Bohas, representing Salt and Nitre, respectively, reveal the dualistic nature of creation, both stable and unstable. These elements are not only present in the physical world but also in human history and spirituality, emphasizing the need for balance and harmony in all aspects of life. The Freemasons' symbolism of Level and Perpendicular serves as a reminder of the importance of staying grounded while also striving for personal growth and evolution."
