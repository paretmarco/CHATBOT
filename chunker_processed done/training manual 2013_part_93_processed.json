  "title": "\"Connecting with the Universe: Contemplative Meditation and Magnetic Passes\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the reader is introduced to the concept of meditation and how it can lead to contemplation. The text explains that during contemplation, individuals can understand things more profoundly compared to when they use their intellect. The conclusion has relevance to the practice of \"Magnetic Passes\" which is discussed in the last 200 tokens. The text explains that passes operate on a pre-verbal level and are effective in solving problems by stimulating changes in the clients. Moreover, passes can speak to the primal mind in a physical way and change the mental state of the operator. Additionally, the use of passes on animals is also discussed.",
  "content": "Passes are movements we do near a person, and there some “secrets” that must be known for implementing their full power. There are several reasons why passes are so effective in solving problems and stimulating changes in our clients . In further details, we must understand that the five following reasons are indistinctly valid at the same time: 1. Passes operate on a pre-verbal level 2. Passes change our boundary perception (in effect, they are not done by caressing, ratherat a certain distance from the body) 3. Passes speak to a primal mind in a physical way, the only one that our primal mind understands 4. Passes change also the mental state of the operator and make him more sensible to the subject. 5. Passes are SYMBOLS and concentrate our WILL Passes on Animals Passes are even felt by animals.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, passes are a powerful tool in solving problems and creating change in our clients. By operating on a pre-verbal level, changing our boundary perception, speaking to our primal mind, changing the mental state of the operator, and concentrating our will, passes allow for deep and effective transformation. In fact, passes are so powerful that they can even be felt by animals, making them a valuable tool in many different contexts."
