  "title": "Magnetic Ecstasy: A Technique for Distant Healing",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored a method to practice distant healing using magnetic states and mental suggestions. Now, we dive deeper into the concept of magnetic ecstasy and its physiological implications. The text mentions the Western tradition of the athanor, which symbolizes the human organism and the regeneration process. Similarly, in the Eastern tradition, the three tan tien areas correspond to different parts of the body. By bringing energy to the top of the head, or the vertex, we can create magnetic ecstasy and an expanded state of consciousness. This connects to the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus, which are all essential components in the physical basis of consciousness.",
  "content": "The athanor is a three-tier oven, and it is the symbol of the human organism in which the great work of regeneration is effected.37 The three-tier symbol38 is the same as the Eastern concept of the three tan tien, which differentiates between three areas of the body (cinnabar fields), corresponding to the area of the navel, the heart and the head.39 In the Chinese tradition, one finds a manner of operating which gradually ascends from the lower to the higher tan tien. In magnetism we can equally bring energy to the top of head. We create in this way what is called “magnetic ecstasy”. Physiologically this point of the body (also called “vertex”) could be envisioned somewhat connected to the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones to communicate to the rest of the endocrine system and also connects to the central nervous system via the hypothalamus. The thalamus is thought to have a key role in the physical basis of consciousness. In magnetism we can do the same and get to expanded state of consciousness. The results depend on practice.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the athanor and the concept of the three-tier symbol are significant in the human process of regeneration. Magnetism and the notion of magnetic ecstasy can help individuals ascend from the lower to the higher points of their body, leading to an expanded state of consciousness. Practicing this technique with music at the end of a session could help achieve a more detached perspective of the world."
