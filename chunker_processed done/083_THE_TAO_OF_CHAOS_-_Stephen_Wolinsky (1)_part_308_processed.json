  "title": "\"Understanding Traumatic Memories: The Energic Pattern and Bifurcation Point\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, therapist and client discussed the process of breaking traumatic memory loops. They talked about creating the loop as energy, allowing it to iterate, and revealed underlying patterns. The client noticed that the pattern disappeared after it spun around. Here, the therapist explains that in every memory break, there is a gap, space, or midpoint after a point of intensity. If we can spot and notice it, we can remember ourselves. The therapist discusses the energetic change in traumatic memory and how it seeks release through a distorted vehicle.",
  "content": "The gap is the \"time,\" if we can spot and notice it, where we are present again and we can remember ourselves. The reason we cannot remember ourselves in a traumatic memory is that too much energetic change is built up within the picture. This energetic build-up is seeking to release. Before therapy, the traumatic memory has so much charge, and resisted charge, that rather than the memory moving, the memory stays fixed. Since the built-up energy has no place to go because it cannot express the anger, fear, or pain of the situation, the energy seeks release through a sublimated, or alternate, and hence distorted vehicle. For example, the pain that a child might experience during a molestation freezes the child's muscles and breath creating a trance (fixation of attention). In this case, the movie is halted and the a-tention remains fixated in fear. To handle that excess undischarged energy of fear, the child might get violent, overeat, vandalize property, take drugs, get pregnant, etc. This is what occurs to some traumatized teenagers; when the excess energy of trauma is not discharged, they sublimate it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, traumatic memories can create a buildup of excessive, undischarged energy that seeks release through sublimated and distorted behaviors, causing long-term consequences for individuals. However, by recognizing the gap or \"time\" where we are present again, we can begin to notice and address this stored-up energy and move towards healing and growth."
