  "title": "\"The Concept of Satori and Magnetism in Alchemy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the concept of \"Satori\" in relation to internal alchemy. Before this, the text explores the concept of Kundalini and how it can be blocked due to a lack of body consciousness. It highlights the importance of being present and connected in the practice of magnetism. The text then draws a distinction between hypnotism and mesmerism. In this last 200 tokens, psychic phenomena is explored in depth with the help of Jay Hudson's \"the law of psychic phenomena”.",
  "content": "In today's society the pattern that occurs most commonly in practice in humans, is instead the one below: we loose consciousness of our body. Our body goes out of consciousness. This stops the kundalini, and this block causes an energy decrease in the person. Too much rationality and staying too long in our thoughts block the Kundalini. To recover it we must reintegrate what went lost and the basis is recovering again real immediate body awareness. TWO BASIC INGREDIENTS TO GET BACK TO THE PRIMAL MIND BE PRESENT IN THE HERE AND NOW BE IN OUR PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY AND IN OUR BODY Basic Point From what we have said it ensues: When we practice magnetism BOTH WE AS THE SUBJECT WE MUST BE IN STATE of Presence. We must CONNECT. Feel we are a WHOLE with our Client. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HYPNOTISM AND MESMERISM From \"the law of psychic phenomena\" of Jay Hudson “When did the higher phenomena show the first signs of decadence ?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to unlocking the full potential of our energy lies in being present in the here and now, developing real body awareness, and connecting with our clients in a whole and mindful way. To achieve this, we must practice magnetism with a state of presence, connecting to our clients and feeling as one. This approach differs greatly from the hypnotic methods of the past, where fixation on an object was the norm. By incorporating these basic principles and staying in tune with our bodies and minds, we can tap into our true energy potential and achieve success."
