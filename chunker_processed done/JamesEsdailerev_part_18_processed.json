  "title": "\"Hypnosleep: Simple yet Powerful Trance Induction Technique\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding 200 tokens, we learned about a simple yet highly effective technique called Hypnosleep, which can elicit a powerful trance state for deepening or to experience one's body in a different way without having anesthesia with the subject. This technique has notable connections with another technique called \"Deep Somnambulism,\" and both are closely tied to the concept of sleep. In this last portion, we will take a closer look at the hypnotic depths of Hypnosleep and how they compare to other states on the hypnosis depth scale, which even Milton Erickson, a famous hypnotist, acknowledged as specific observable phenomena.",
  "content": "Hypnosleep works through elicitation of a deep trance state by starting from normal sleep: yes, a person can be easily hypnotized while asleep if using the right words and observing some simple rules. This technique can easily been performed even by persons that know themselves very well. Where in fact can this technique be best performed, if not in the intimacy of your own bed? Locating Hypnosleep in the hypnosis depth scale To understand the power of this technique, you must first get to know the hypnotic depths that are usually taught by and for hypnotists. It is true that some schools deny the existence of these hypnotic scales. The fact is that if we concentrate on the phenomena, many phenomena can be achieved even without a previous deepening, but it is also true that these depths can also be considered as specific phenomena in themselves. Even the famous hypnotist Milton Erickson, father of Conversational Hypnosis acknowledged in some early writings the existence of such a states. In its later works he didnâ€™t speak any more of them, but just because his attention was in another direction, and in reality never denied them as specific observable phenomena.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Hypnosleep is a powerful technique that can be performed even by individuals who know themselves well. By starting from normal sleep, a deep trance state can be elicited using the right words and simple rules. While some schools deny the existence of hypnotic depths, the ability to achieve phenomena such as amnesia signals a full somnambulistic state. The intimacy of your own bed makes for the perfect setting to explore the potential of Hypnosleep."
