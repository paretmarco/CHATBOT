  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the usefulness of mesmerized water as a healing remedy. As per the author, mesmerized water is a potent remedy that can be taken internally as a medicine or externally through compress or bath. Through this remedy, the author shares the success story of curing constipation and other diseases. Before this, the author shared techniques to relieve pain, particularly in rheumatism diseases, through mesmerism. These techniques involved making passes gently and firmly with slight pressure on the temples and backward over the side and top head to the crown.",
  "content": "MESMERISED WATER AND ITS VIRTUES Mesmerised water is a most powerful remedial agent. It can be taken internally as a medicine or a drink, or used, externally by compress or in a bath. The value of mesmerised water is best judged by the results produced by it. I have known the most obstinate cases of constipation to have been effectually cured by itâ€”some of the patients having for years found it necessary to take a pill or some other strong aperient every second day to make the bowels act; and in one case of a poor man, in whom the peristaltic action of the bowels seemed to be temporarily paralysed, who remained without action for a fortnight drugs were used freely without effect. He was giver a glassful of mesmeric water but twice, when his difficulty was remedied. The treatment was continued for five weeks, and he was completely restored. In this case I never even saw the patient. The mesmerised water was sent from Liverpool, and administered by a friend to the patient in Blackburn. I value mesmerised water, because by its use you get at the organisation therapeutically in the absence of personal magnetisation or attendance.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating mesmerised water and other magnetised mediums into your healthcare routine can have remarkable therapeutic benefits. Whether taken internally or applied externally, these natural remedies offer a non-invasive approach to healing, enabling you to access the organisation therapeutically without the need for personal magnetisation or attendance. So why not try integrating mesmerised water treatments into your healthcare regime, and see the astonishing results for yourself?"
