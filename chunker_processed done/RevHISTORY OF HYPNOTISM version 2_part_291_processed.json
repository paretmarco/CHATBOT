  "title": "What is Dupotet's \"magic telegraph\" and how did it produce physical and mental effects?",
  "first_phrase": "The earlier section discusses Dupotet's \"magic telegraph\" - a form of mental suggestion that he used to produce physical and spiritual effects on his subject. He could make his subject mimic his every move, feel pain and mimic his emotions, even when consciously awake. Dupotet's manipulation of his subject's perception was so powerful that he could make them believe that water was brandy or that they were on the sea. In this last section of the text, Dupotet describes his ability to bring out any desired passion in his subject's mind in the same way.",
  "content": "Braid noticed the same instantaneity in hypnotic imitation, and so have modern hypnotists, who also can produce this phenomenon. The ‘spiritual’ effects of his ‘magic telegraph’ he thus describes:- \"I take a glass of water; at my thought, by my will, this liquid will no longer be water, but wine, brandy, liqueur, medicine, and I see effects produced as real, as positive as by those agents themselves… And for these phenomena, is it necessary that the subject should be asleep? Not at all! He is awake, sees with his eyes, has his wits about him, and yet cannot resist the power of a creation which people call ‘imaginary.' I create fire, I make a cold thing burning, or my subject will hold a hot coal in his hand without being burned… I think of cold, and he shivers. I go in imagination on the sea, and he becomes seasick and vomits.\" He goes on to say that in the same way, by a thought, he could arouse any passion he desired in the mind of his subject.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Braid's observations of hypnotic imitation and Dupotet's experiments on the power of mental suggestion and magnetism highlight the remarkable effects of imagination and suggestion on the human mind and body. Even today, these phenomena continue to fascinate and baffle modern hypnotists and suggestionists, inspiring new research and exploration into the power of suggestion and the human psyche."
