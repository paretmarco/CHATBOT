  "title": "\"Understanding Trauma Energy and Resolving Patterns for Self-Remembering\"",
  "first_phrase": "This concluding section delves deeper into the nature of trauma by exploring the pathways through which excess energy is released. The author explains how the observer's reaction to trauma can determine whether it leads to a sublimated pattern of energy release or the resolution of unfreezing memory. The concept of a dynamical system is introduced as a graphic representation of the energetic pathway of trauma. The little boy and the cousin example highlights the importance of acknowledging the point of intensity or bifurcation point in processing trauma.",
  "content": "These sublimated attempts at releasing the energy become a pattern and hence a way to greater and greater frustration. However, if the excess energy is allowed to discharge while looking at a memory by experiencing the emotion as energy, the pattern of releasing excess energy in a sublimated and fixated way resolves itself and gives the person extra energy and unfreezes the memory. This opens up the gap or space within trauma memory, allowing self-remembering to occur. The cycle of energy is a graphic representation of a dynamical system which creates a phase portrait (or picture). \"The forces of the psyche, and the rules they obey are generally referred to as a dynamical system.\" (Psychological Perspectives, Abraham Fred, 1989) This means that the energetic pathway described in the highlighted case above between the little boy and the cousin is first organized to handle the pain and ________________ chaos of the oral rape. To move beyond the rape, the adult must notice the energetic pattern, called in chaos theory, trajectories and the point of intensity, i.e., bifurcation point. It is at the point of intensity that the energy is at its highest; this is where I point out and show the gap within the memory.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing and understanding the pattern of releasing excess energy caused by traumatic events can lead to resolution and newfound energy. By identifying the intensity, or bifurcation point, within the energetic pathway, individuals can effectively process their memories and release the fixed patterns. This empowers individuals to heal and move beyond the traumatic experiences."
