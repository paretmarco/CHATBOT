  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author describes a technique to demesmerize a footman who had been subjected to \"Cross-Mesmerism.\" To achieve this, he formed a circle with every person who had touched the young man, including the gentleman who had mesmerized him, and de-mesmerized the patient after calming everyone's emotions. In the last 200 tokens, the text introduces Deleuze's mode of procedure for a successful mesmerism session. The author states that the therapist should remove all persons who might constrain the treatment and sit opposite to the patient, instructing them to banish every fear and indulge in hope. Additionally, the author advises on taking precautions to avoid interruptions during the session.",
  "content": "DELEUZES MODE OF PROCEDURE Using his own words,’” Once you will be agreed and determined to treat the matter seriously, remove from the patient all those persons who might occasion you any restraint, do not keep with you any but the necessary witnesses (only one if possible), and require of them, not to interfere by any means in the processes which you employ and in the effects which are the consequences of them, but to combine with you doing good service to the patient.” Manage so as to have neither too much heat nor cold, so that nothing may constrain the freedom of your movements, and take every precaution not to be interrupted during the sitting. “Then take your patient, sit in the most convenient manner possible opposite to him, or her, on a seat somewhat higher, so that his knees may be between yours, and that your feet may be between his. First, require him to resign himself, to think of nothing, not to distract his mind in order to examine the effects he will experience to banish every fear and indulge in hope, and not to be uneasy or discouraged if the action of magnetism produces in him momentary pain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Deleuze’s mode of procedure for magnetism involves removing all potential distractions, creating a comfortable and uninterrupted environment, and following a specific process of hand movements and eye contact to establish a connection with the patient. By following these steps, one can effectively apply magnetism for therapeutic purposes."
