Additionally, the section includes exercises from the magnetic school. The author emphasizes that their notes enhance the reader's comprehension of the science discussed in the book.",
  "content": "The real difference between Hypnosis, Hypnotism, Mesmerism This small chapter is fundamental in understanding the whole work and is aimed at people who have already read books about the mind and hypnosis. When we read this text by J. Coates, as well as every other writer of his time, there is always the risk of mis-understanding. As the centuries have changed, so have the meanings of the words used. With this in mind, we risk reading his book and not grasping the meanings of the words as used originally by Coates, because they indicate a different state of what is today called “hypnosis.” Today the word “hypnosis” is used mainly to pinpoint a state that is originated through words (i.e. verbal hypnosis), in which the critical factor is bypassed. However, in the past the word “hypnosis” was slightly different: a state in which not the critical factor alone, but the WHOLE CONSCIOUS MIND was bypassed. Hypnotism means the person acts as an automaton and they are hypnotized with their EYES WIDE OPEN. In order to hypnotize, it is necessary to have will power, as well as confidence. Another big difference is between Mesmerism and Hypnotism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the differences between hypnosis, hypnotism, and mesmerism is crucial in comprehending the various terminologies used by authors in the past and today. While \"modern hypnosis\" centers on efficient communication, hypnotism relates to a state where the whole conscious mind is bypassed, and mesmerism involves the conscious use of life fluid. Knowing the historical and contemporary definitions will aid in clear scientific discussions and effective application in the field of research on the mind."
