Different types of “poles” 1. The first one is called ‘the black pole’. It goes left and right and down until the navel and the hypocondria. In this pole there are normally obstructions. Working on it can be very pleasant for the person, and also gives a sense of calm and peace. 2. A second pole is the lombo-sacral pole. 3. A third pole is the breast pole.

It goes from the nose until the black pole in men and from the mouth until the white pole in women.",
