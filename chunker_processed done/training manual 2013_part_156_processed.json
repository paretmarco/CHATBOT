  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author discussed the importance of concentration and how it plays a role in achieving what one desires. In this final part, the author instructs the reader to sit down and place an object in front of them, specifically a copper penny, for a calming focal point. The author then guides the reader to relax and steady themselves while taking deep breaths and repeating the phrase \"Breath Is Life,\" all while employing a hip movement that can improve body shape. Ultimately, the text emphasizes the importance of hard work and concentration in achieving a better self and existence.",
  "content": "You gaze at it restfully, never losing sight of it, whatever the movement of your body may be. Be certain that you do not press your hands that are resting upon the lower limbs, as all of the muscles are to be relaxed except the spinal column, which is to be held erect and firm. Now take your prelude breaths of short inhalations and exhalations, four or more times, and then empty your lungs as much as you can without using any effort, as effort means failure in all things. Then inhale fully and deeply, at the same time repeating mentally the sentence, \"Breath Is Life.\" While inhaling and thinking upon the sentence \"Breath is Life,\" bend your body forward, gazing steadily at the cent before you, keeping head steady with the movement of the body. Remember that this movement is a hip movement, and it will help to reduce the size of the hips and expand the diaphragm, thus giving you a better and a more graceful shape.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing deep, intentional breathing while performing physical movements can improve one's diaphragm, reduce hip size, and promote a better and more graceful shape. Remember to keep your muscles relaxed, hold your spine erect, and emphasize one word of the sentence \"Breath is Life\" while inhaling deeply. By following these steps, you can enhance your physical and mental well-being."
