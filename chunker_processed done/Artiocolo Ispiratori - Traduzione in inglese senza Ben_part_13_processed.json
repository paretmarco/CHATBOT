  "title": "\"The Power of Magnetism in Accessing the Enteric Brain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the relationship between emotions and the body's energy points. Now, let's take a closer look at the technical aspects of this process. Mesmer's school identified specific body points as \"poles\" that facilitate energy flow and promote the incorporation of harmonious ideas. These points are not only important nerves or glands but also gateways to the deeper implicate level in a quantum perspective. The epigastrium, known in modern science as the \"second brain,\" plays a crucial role in this process. Understanding the significance of the enteric brain is the focus of the book \"Awakening Your Other Brain,\" authored by our writer.",
  "content": "In a quantum perspective these are points that in some way help to access to the deeper implicate level. In fact what we observe is that concentrating the mind on such points can many times be a powerful way to shift awareness. And shifting awareness produce always changes in our three dimensional perception. A very important physical point in this regard consists in the epigastrium. Modern science confirms the fact that such area hosts a kind of “second brain”. Modern hypnotherapy and psychology are too often focused solely on the mind, although scientific researches have given abundant proof of the significant role played by the body. It is precisely for this reason, to clarify the extent of significance which such “enteric brain” possesses, that I penned my book titled “Awakening your other brain”. This brain is called enteric because it is here that many of the elements which are peculiar to the brain, beginning with the neurotransmitters, are produced and utilized.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by recognizing and focusing on physical points such as the epigastrium, we can tap into the power of our \"enteric brain\" and create a deeper mind-body connection. Modern science has confirmed the crucial role this \"second brain\" plays in regulating our physiological processes and immune system. Through magnetic methodology, we can harness its potential to induce profound changes in our perception and awareness, leading to a healthier and more fulfilled life."
