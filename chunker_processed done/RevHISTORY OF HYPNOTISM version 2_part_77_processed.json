  "content": "It can instead be perceived with our intuition, with our whole being, by putting the mind in a specific state as we are bathed in it. Note: We see here a striking similitude between this idea of “fluid” and the modern theory of Bohm of the holoverse. In summary, the holographic theory states that material reality is continually unfolding out of, and unfolding back into, a vast ocean of quantum energy, an ocean of undivided totality. Matter, a small ripple on this ocean, is sensed by us in the form of frequencies. These frequencies are transmitted via the nervous system and stored in our minds holographically. Our minds mirror the basic order of the universe.34 Practical hints. External reality is but a construct of the senses. Allow yourself to begin to feel, that what you feel outside you, and what you feel inside you, are two sides of the same way of perceiving the universe. Therefore nothing in the universe is separate. There is always an influence that manifests it in some way through the action of one thing on other things.",
