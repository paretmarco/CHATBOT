  "title": "\"Tellurism, Magnetism, and the Magnetiscope in Medicine\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the philosophy and practice of tellurism, a natural therapy that does not reject medicine but instead focuses on eliminating its abuses. The professor's talents and discernment are vital to determining treatment. The use of music, perfumes, and telluric baths are advised to enhance the effects of the treatment. The text also explains the tellurist's scientific basis for discontinuing treatment once visible results no longer prevail. Additionally, the text highlights the Magnetiscope, an invention by Rutter, which magnetizers such as Ashburner and Leger fervently supported.",
  "content": "It is mainly a peculiarity of tellurism, that, after the cure is finished, the effects produced upon the patient during the cure, such as drowsiness, sleep, convulsive movements of the eyelids, disappear gradually in geometrical progression, as soon as the cure is finished Rutter, Ashburner and Theodore Leger An instance of distraction from the main issue was furnished by Rutter's ‘Magnetiscope,’ a little instrument from which the most wonderful results were expected, and which was taken up warmly by Dr. Ashburner, Dr. Theodore Leger (called the ‘Psycho-dunamist,’) and some other magnetizers. This instrument was a development of the very old fortune-telling device of a ring suspended by a thread which is held in the hand, the ring answering questions by tapping on the side of a tumbler, inside of which it hangs. In Rutter's instrument, the pendant hangs from a fixed support, and any unconscious propulsion of it by the operator is thus prevented.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the peculiar effects of tellurism gradually vanish after completing the cure, and magnetism had a short-lived alliance with homoeopathy in challenging the traditional practices of medicine. Although the Magnetiscope proved unsuccessful in solving scientific questions, it highlights the importance of experimentation and exploration in developing new medical treatments."
