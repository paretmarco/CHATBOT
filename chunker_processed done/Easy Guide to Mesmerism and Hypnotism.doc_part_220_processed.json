  "title": "\"Stage Hypnosis: Creating a Baffling and Astonishing Performance\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the use of hypnosis for entertainment purposes. He explains how a simple trick with music and poses can make the audience forget their troubles and succumb to the \"merry dance.\" In the last 200 tokens, he goes on to describe how the hypnotized subject can be catalepsed, and made rigid like a board. The author also gives instructions on how to make the subject fall back and then simulate an emergency situation to make the whole act more interesting. He suggests tying a white handkerchief around the subject's forehead, carrying him shoulder high, and playing a funeral tune. The whole scenario would be a compelling and thrilling exhibition for the audience.",
  "content": "Make passes from the head down to the spine, and from the top-head down to the finger tips and to the heels. These passes being made with the intention of making the subject rigid, and of exhibiting your influence over the nerves of motion, etc. When this is done, stand behind him a little distance, and make passes towards him with the intention of pulling him back, and he will fall into your hands. Lay him down carefully on his back upon the ground. Release four of your statues, inform them that this poor fellow is very ill, or has been found drowned, etc., and let them act out their dreaming, for a few minutes, and the effect will be exceedingly interesting. You may then suggest that the person (catalepsed subject) be taken to the police-station infirmary, or dead-house, as the case may be. Tie a white handkerchief around the subject's forehead—to heighten effect, with two subjects to his shoulders, and the other two to his feet. Let them carry him shoulder high—(the musicians playing something funeral).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism can be an intriguing and captivating tool for creating a dramatic and unforgettable experience for your audience. By following the steps of inducing catalepsy and creating a funeral procession, you can ultimately surprise and mystify your audience with a dramatic and unexpected twist. Remember to approach this practice with caution and with the utmost respect for your subjects."
