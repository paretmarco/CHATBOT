  "title": "\"The True Initiation: Conquering the Light Through Vague Traditions\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the concept of tradition in the context of occult knowledge, highlighting how genuine tradition cannot be objectively transferred. In the last part of the text, the author discusses the true purpose of initiation, which is to teach individuals how to conquer the light. Unlike formalistic initiations that often originate from petty ambitions, the true Initiate aims to become enlightened in order to serve the realization of great and good work, without ever making known their own worth.",
  "content": "Our spirit is not a lamp that can be artificially lit: it is a fireplace that must vanquish the darkness of its own accord, so that, instead of burning underneath the ashes, it can leap into flame and burn freely. Strictly speaking, the objective of the Initiation is the teaching of how to conquer the light. This overarching aim rises beyond the many initiations that differ in detail, beyond the applications of initiatic procedures and beyond all teachings of secondary importance. Formalistic initiations belong to this order, although within their limited scope they do nevertheless have a useful influence. Their modesty places them above the occultist initiations, which often originate from petty ambitions: the desire to shine based on the knowledge of secrets unknown to the masses, the ambition to possess exceptional powers. The true Initiate aspires only to become enlightened so that he may act in the service of realizing great and good work. He is not interested in anything extraordinary, he merely wishes to remain silent, without ever making known his own worth, while he dedicates himself in secrecy to the task that has been assigned to him in the realisation of the Great Work.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the true objective of initiation is the conquest of the light, and the dedication to service in realizing great work. This requires humility, secrecy, and a steadfast commitment to the task at hand. The valuable knowledge passed down through ancient imagery, codified by Hermetists and Freemasons, continues to hold wisdom for those willing to embark on the path towards enlightenment."
