  "title": "\"Understanding and Working with Symbolism for Different Personality Types\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, different personality types were described and how they can be helped in working with the power of symbols. Now, the last 200 tokens focus on the specific characteristics and behaviors of each type. These types include the Circle, Pacific/Adapter, Conqueror, and Egoist. The Circle type tends to sublimate a lot and is dominated by the moon principle, while the Pacific/Adapter type easily adapts to any situation. The Conqueror is very decisive and has a positive aura, but lacks feminine aspects. Lastly, the Egoist uses their ideas to define reality and tends towards active absorption. To engage with these types, different methods such as gazing fixes and symbol usage are recommended.",
  "content": "Don't try to use to much the upper part. This type is very receptive and easily mesmerized or magnetized. You must use also symbols. This type will be venusian/circle in his way of doing and will sublimate a lot. His phisiology tend to be dominated by the moon principle. “Conqueror”. Very “I do” and “I will”. The future must be only one. Inspire and expire fast in front of the mirror. Be in active position and use only the upper part He manifests “positive od”.

  "last_phrase": "To effectively influence and mesmerize individuals of different personality types, one must understand their physiology and dominant principles. Use symbols, a strong gaze, and active positioning to influence the conqueror and nervous types, while balancing and sublimating the venusian and martial/circle types. For the egoist type, use active absorption and mirror visualization, while the altruist/adapter type requires passive absorptions and reasoning development. Remember to avoid excessive use of the upper part for all types."
