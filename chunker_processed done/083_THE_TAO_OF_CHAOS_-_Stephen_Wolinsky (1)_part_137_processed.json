  "first_phrase": "In this final part, we delve into the Great Illusion of Time and how it affects our perception of reality. The concept of time has been explored extensively in Quantum Consciousness and Stalking the Wild Pendulum by Itzhak Bentov. The idea that time is an illusion is a popular one in Eastern philosophy, where it is known as \"The Great Illusion of Time.\" Our experiences are bound by time, and without it, neither we nor anything else could exist. This understanding prompts us to contemplate the question: could anything exist in this universe if there was no time for it to exist in?",
  "content": "To understand this better let us look back on Time as presented in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I and in Stalking the Wild Pendulum by Itzhak Bentov. Bentov suggests that as a pendulum moves, at the top of its swing there is a pause and at the bottom of its swing there is a pause. In that pause there is no time, nor is there anything there to measure time. Bentov suggests that this occurs 14 times per second. With time's disappearance the illusion of an object's existence disappears. This is because nothing can exist, including you, if there is no time to exist in. In Chapter 6 of Quantum Consciousness, Volume I we were asked to contemplate: Could anything exist in this universe if there was no time for it to exist in? When in workshops I ask participants to consider this, generally there is a blankness of mind, because we cannot nor can anything exist unless there is a time or duration. In other words, the mind and its experiences cannot exist without time. Therefore, experiences are time bound; no timeâ€”no experience. The Great Illusion of Time is that we are always here.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of time and its relationship to our existence is complex and intriguing. As suggested by Bentov and explored in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I, time is not a constant, and the illusion of our existence is intricate. However, the exploration of this concept through practices such as Raja Yoga can lead to a deeper understanding of our existence and connection to the universe. So let us delve deeper into this fascinating topic and discover the secrets of the gaps in time."
