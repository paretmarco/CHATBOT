  "title": "How to Cultivate Psychometry: Insights Through Sensitivity.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the ideal temperament for mesmeric experiments - one that is tall, dark, and wiry. They also introduce psychometry, a technique for measuring the soul, which can be cultivated even in individuals who have never been mesmerized. In the last 200 tokens, the author further explores the nuances of psychometry, indicating that it is a form of intuition that allows for a deeper insight into an individual's character, and that women tend to be better psychometrical sensitives than men. They also mention that psychometry can trace traits of character back to their basis in ancestry.",
  "content": "As physiognomy and phrenology give us by external indications some knowledge of the character and dispositions of our fellows, psychometry gives a keener and deeper insight; it passes the boundary of the external, and measures the soul Intuition (manifested through the organ of Human Nature), has been called the sixth sense. Reason is a mathematician. With her, nothing must be taken for granted. She argues, demonstrates, and logically concludes. To prove the centre of a circle, she will approach her task with algebraic formula-square and compass. Not so with intuition. She will lay her finger on the spot, and say. “There it is,” and she is right. Psychometry is intuition, exalted or spiritualised. Certain organisations are more favourable to its manifestations than others. “Woman, for many reasons, makes a better psychometrical sensitive than man. Her brain is particularly adapted for its psychological expression. By Psychometry, true traits of character can be unfolded and traced to their basis in ancestry.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, psychometry is a powerful tool that provides a deeper insight into the soul and can unfold true character traits and family history through the influence left on old relics. With its ability to discover valuable mines and assist in scientific investigations, it is clear that psychometry is a gift that can be harnessed for practical purposes. Whether you are looking to uncover hidden truths or simply enhance your intuition, exploring the possibilities of psychometry could prove to be a valuable journey."
