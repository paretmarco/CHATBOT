  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Understanding the Natural Pulsation of the Universe\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains how the physical universe is in a constant process of appearance and disappearance â€“ a process that our Embodied Mind obscures making it appear as one fluid no gap world. In Tao of Chaos Exercise 32 and 33, the author describes steps to experience this natural process and recognize the natural pulsation of the universe to free oneself from illusions of permanence. Tao of Chaos Exercise 34 refers to an earlier Quantum Exercises volume, looking at Bohm's implicate and explicate order through observing the world without blinking or noticing objects losing their boundaries.",
  "content": "For example, knowing things appear and disappear on their own allows us to stop trying to \"hold-on\" to and make permanent through the use of time that which naturally has a cycle of its own. Tao of Chaos Exercise 33 Step ITake a moment and again consider this appearance and disappearance of yourself which occurs naturally on its own. ________________ Step IINext, see if you can experience the natu- ral pulsation of the universe in its continual state of coming and no-state of being. In this pulsation, or shall I say the recognition of the natural pulsation that is, there is a freedom from the illusion and fixation that occurs when we try to hold ourself and the rest of the world in place. Tao of Chaos Exercise #34 First let us review Quantum Exercises #34-36 in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I, page 143-147 . Step IEyes open, no blinking, see the world from back there. Step IINotice as things lose boundaries, they be- gin to give the feeling of movement and breathe. Notice that objects lose their boundaries and run into one another. Where do we go? In Quantum Consciousness, Volume. I, we looked at David Bohm's implicate and explicate order.",
  "last_phrase": "By recognizing the natural pulsation of the universe and understanding that everything has its own cycle, we can free ourselves from the illusion of permanence and embrace the ever-changing nature of existence. These exercises offer a powerful tool for finding liberation from fixation and experiencing the deeper unity of everything."
