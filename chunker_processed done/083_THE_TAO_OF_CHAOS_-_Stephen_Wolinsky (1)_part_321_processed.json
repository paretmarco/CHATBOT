  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author delves into the importance of knowing one's own trances and traumas in order to reabsorb one's identities into essence. The steps for achieving this include seeing the identities in the foreground, feeling the essential quality from the background, and recognizing that identities and emptiness are made of the same substance. The author uses Barbara's case to illustrate how the reabsorption of identities cannot occur in one session but requires unpacking trances and identities covering the trauma. The Tao of Chaos seeks to allow, but essence cannot absorb lies, distortions, and denied memories or identities.",
  "content": "Traumas and Trances In both Trances People Live and The Dark Side of the Inner Child, trauma is seen as the cornerstone in the development of the defensive trance. What must be emphasized is that during a trauma a trance is created which helps to defend the individual from knowing, feeling, or remembering what occurred. This brings about the tightening of the muscles, holding of breath, and a storing up of excess energy. This is important because to live the Tao of Chaos requires the knowledge of your own trances. No I-dentity can be reabsorbed into Essence unless the truth of the trauma be known. To restate again, the Essence cannot absorb lies, distortions, and denied memories or I-dentities. The Tao of Chaos is about allowing, and so let us illustrate what occurs around a trauma. 111USTRAIION # 16 fRA LIMAS AND IRANCES As you can see, the T is the trauma and the defenses of trance surround the trauma. When you are working with yourself or another, you will hit defensive trances like a wall as you enter into the core of the trauma.",
  "last_phrase": "To truly live the Tao of Chaos, it's crucial to acknowledge and understand our defensive trances. Trauma creates these trances that help us defend ourselves, but we must confront and unlearn them to let our true essence shine through. Remember, the last learned is the first unlearned, and proceeding safely through the stages is the key."
