  "title": "\"Mastering the Power of Enchantment through the Eyes\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraph, the author discussed the importance of mastering one's body and mental plane to become a positive instrument. Moving forward, the author highlights the ability to enchant, which is not limited to humans, but only man is capable of steering it in a conscious and positive direction. The author gives examples of animals, such as snakes, using their charm upon their victim for their benefit. The story of a fox and the hens is also mentioned, where some hens willingly threw themselves underneath the fox. The last part of the text discusses the classical technique of hypnosis, which is now extinct but was based on fascination.",
  "content": "A similar narration had also been reported to us by our master. The protagonists of that story consisted in a fox and some hens 47. A friend of his owned a hen house, and was astounded by the fact that some of the hens would go missing. Imagine how much did his astonishment escalate when he realized that such hens used to climb over a branch, while underneath, on the ground, a fox used to look at them and wave its head in the process. It appears as if, on their own initiative, the hens would then throw themselves underneath, where they would be devoured by the fox. Fascination is also the historical basis of the classical “give me your eyes, please” of the hypnotizers of yesteryear. Though such a personage is still alive in popular perceptions, he has effectively become extinct by now, given that the techniques of hypnosis which are currently utilized on a preponderant basis are both lengthy and based on the use of words.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the use of the hypnotic gaze may have become extinct in modern hypnosis, the power of a confident and engaging gaze cannot be denied. Whether in building relationships or influencing others, the way we use our eyes can play a valuable role in our interactions and communication with others."
