  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explored the complementary benefits of Mesmerism and Yoga training. It also discussed the enemies of Mesmerism and how \"suggestion\" is not the only cause of its effects. In the appendix, the reader is introduced to Real hypnotic fascination and magnetism as an important aspect of Mesmerism. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the author narrates their encounter with an elderly man in Europe who possessed an extraordinary ability to petrify people with his gaze. This encounter led the author to delve deeper into Mesmerism and Hypnotic Fascination, which are lesser-known fields of study.",
  "content": "But the fact that “suggestion” could exist in some cases doesn’t preclude the possibility that it will be an accompanying or facilitating force of the mesmeric effects, and not their cause. In fact, there are many cases where the possibility of “suggestion” is to be excluded, and it just one unexplained feat is sufficient to put down a theory based only on it. Our impression is that we see only a part of a multifaceted reality, and we want to see only the materialistic one we can see, but at the same time we lose the others. This book is for opening your mind to these other possibilities. APPENDIX 1 TRAINING IN MAGNETISM Real hypnotic fascination is different from modern hypnosis and more similar to the oriental techniques of charming and fascination. In mesmerism we work with magnetism. Even if not well defined by science, magnetism has its own reality and it has been used for thousands of years by magnetic healers around the world. The source of mesmerism is in Europe. Our interest in hypnotic fascination began here in Europe, as we met an elderly man able to truly petrify people with the gaze.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of suggestion cannot be relied upon as the sole cause of mesmeric effects. It is essential to keep an open mind and explore the multifaceted reality we live in. The book discussed in this text serves as a guide to expand our understanding of hypnotic fascination through the practice of magnetism, a technique used for centuries by magnetic healers."
