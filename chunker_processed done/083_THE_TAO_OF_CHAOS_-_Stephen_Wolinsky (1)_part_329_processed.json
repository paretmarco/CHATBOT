  "title": "Therapy Session: Embracing Confusion and Numbness as Energy",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the therapist guides the client, Barbara, through feelings of numbness and confusion to uncover and experience deep-seated grief from a past divorce. The therapist helps Barbara confront the cognitive distortions that have kept her in these trances, allowing her to finally feel and process the overwhelming emotions she has been avoiding. The concept of trances and emotions as energy is further explained in Quantum Consciousness: Volume I, Chapter 4.",
  "content": "She has been resisting being confused by trying to \"get clear.\" Hence, I ask her to create the trance knowingly with awarenessâ€”that which she has been creating unknowingly without awareness. Therapist: What are you feeling right now? Client: Numb. Therapist: Where do you feel the numbness in your body? Client: My heart. Therapist: What is the size and shape of the numbness? Client: Like a round cocoon. Therapist: Make several xerox copies of the cocoon. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now, let the copies go and merge with the numbness of the cocoon. Client: Okay. Therapist: Can you experience the numbness of the cocoon as slow moving energy? Client: Okay. Therapeutic Note Once again to emphasize, the trances of confusion and numbness protected Barbara from experiencing her biological grief. Furthermore, the trances are held in place by a cognitive distortion, i.e., the grief of this divorce must not be allowed. Therapist: What are you feeling right now? Client: (she begins to sob) Overwhelming pain and grief. Therapist: Feel the grief. Client: I am. (After several minutes pass) Therapist: What's happening now?",
  "last_phrase": "By acknowledging and consciously merging with her trance, the therapist facilitated the client's understanding of the cognitive distortion that had been preventing her from feeling the full extent of her grief. Embracing the grief allowed the client to process her emotions, resulting in a potential path towards healing and growth."
