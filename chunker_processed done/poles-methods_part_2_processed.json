  "title": "Understanding the Seven Poles of Magnetism",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the different poles of the body used in magnetism, along with the benefits of working on them. The poles include the navel, breast, mouth, eye, and hands, among others. The author also emphasizes the importance of combining the hands pole with others to create equators. The section also delves into the tools of a magnetizer such as sound of the voice, fire of the eyes, and magnetized water, along with how to touch a patient for them to feel magnetic effects. Overall, this text offers interesting insights into the practices of magnetism and its various techniques.",
  "content": "The fifth pole goes from the nose until the top of the head, and from the nose until the upper lip. It includes also the ears. We work on this pole when we have mental problems or we want to heighten the spirit. The sith pole is the eye pole. Its action get in touch with the same pole in the magnetisee. To get results, the right eye must look at the left eye in both the operator as the subject. Thuis pole is very strong between people of a different sex to enhance energy and to boost the tone. The seventh pole is the hands pole and can combine with the others in order to create the equators. It is the easiest one to use. To use it you must put the two index one toward the other and in the middle the part you want to magnetise. You will get there the same warmth that you get on the black pole whe you are well magnetised. (Mesmer Justifi√© - Paulet) Tools of the magnetizer: sound of the voice fire of the eyes on the eyes of the patient or on the ill part Magnetised water How we must touch a patient in order that s/he can feel the magnetic effects?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetization is a powerful technique that involves working on specific poles of the body using tools such as sound, fire, and magnetized water. To apply magnetic effects, the magnetizer must touch the patient with their thumbs on the nerve of the solar plexus and fingers on the \"hypocondres.\" By mastering this technique, one can enhance energy, boost tone, and solve mental problems while improving a patient's overall health."
