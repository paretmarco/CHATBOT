  "title": "\"Essential Qualities for Successful Mesmerism: Health, Willpower, and Adaptability\"",
  "first_phrase": "Mesmerism, a practice that was popularized in the 18th century as a means of inducing hypnosis, requires certain predispositions and habits to make it work effectively. In the earlier part of this text, we learn that not everyone can be mesmerized or be a successful experimenter, and that there are physical and mental traits that can make one predisposed to it. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of health, vitality, and soundness of character to possess the \"mesmeric power\". This power can be improved through exercise and legitimate use, as well as a strong will, patience, endurance, and sympathy. The author also provides physical traits that are beneficial for a mesmerist, such as a clear eye and a steady gaze.",
  "content": "The Legitimate use of the power increases it, while the loss of power may less seldom be attributed to its use than to other causes which may undermine the health and Influence of the magnetiser. Whatever contributes to the health, vitality, goodness of heart, and soundness of head of the mesmerist, contribute to his “mesmeric power”, health and vitality being the leading requisites. The health habits of a mesmerist should be good, his will strong, while patience, endurance perseverance, and sympathies should be marked features in his character. He should have a good, full, clear eye—colour not so much a matter of importance, although persons of dark and hazel eyes make the most successful experimenters and entertainers, and those of dark blue, blue, and violet eyes, successful healers. A steady gaze is essential. No one can hope to be a mesmerist who cannot look another man or woman straight in the face. Further, a mesmerist should be able to make all necessary movements with ease and grace— natural like I have seen some good souls, possessing a fair aptitude for Mesmerism, so awkward in their movements as to arouse the visible in those upon whom they would operate.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the legitimate use of mesmeric power increases it, while good health, vitality, and soundness of character are essential requisites for a successful Mesmerist. A steady gaze and ease of movement are also essential, as is temperance in all things. By practicing self-government, developing willpower, and concentrating one's energies, a Mesmerist can achieve successful results. Remember, the maintenance and preservation of good health come by nature, and cultivating a healthy lifestyle is key to becoming a successful mesmerist."
