Engraving on a book of Robert Fludd showing the two sides of man According to Robert Flud, man has two poles, like the earth; and magnetism can only take place when his body is in the proper position. Man also has two sides, the positive and the negative, corresponding to the right side and the left side as you can see in the image above.
