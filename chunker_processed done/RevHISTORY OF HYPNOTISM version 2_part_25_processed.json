  "content": "Animal Magnetism in relationship with the history of hypnotic science I have perfected the practice of Magnetism and Fascination in parallel with studies on the most modern techniques such as NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis. I have participated in many NLP, Hypnosis and other conventions, the last one in Montecarlo where Zig Ziglar’s son was also among the speakers. I personally knew Gil Boyne, Ormond Mc Gill and many others. Having knowledge of so many kinds of techniques, I can assure you that Magnetism is a plus. You will find that the techniques and approaches in magnetism touch deeper strata of the human being. Practicing Animal Magnetism opens the path to a series of inexplicable healings that most of the time tend to suggest that we should open our logical mind more to what we don’t know. Non verbal communication The non-verbal is inborn and simple, while the verbal needs to be learnt and is complex Magnetism opens the path to a kind of communication that goes on without words, and that most of the time cannot be explained fully even by trying all rationalistic hypotheses. This communication demands sensitivity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing Animal Magnetism can open up a path to inexplicable healings and nonverbal communication. While verbal communication can be complex and learned, nonverbal communication is innate and dense. The key to learning magnetism is to approach it with an open mind and sensitivity, and the benefits of this technique can be far-reaching, both in terms of personal growth and healing."
