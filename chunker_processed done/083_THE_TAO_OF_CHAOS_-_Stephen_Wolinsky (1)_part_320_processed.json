  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text delves into the habit of seeking fulfillment in relationships to fill our own emptiness. It warns about the dangers in fixating attention on others and neglecting our own true essential nature, which is emptiness. The text also presents a cautionary tale of Barbara, who has fused with her partner's wants and desires as a defense mechanism against her own nothingness. The text highlights the importance of taking apart and examining the trances and I-dentities that cover our traumas before attempting to reabsorb our I-dentities.",
  "content": "A#9 can be very easily guided into the nothingness of Essence but caution has to be taken that superficial nothingness, created nothingness, or symbols for nothingness, is not mistaken for the vastness of their own Essence. I-dentitiesUnderlying StateOver-Compensating Identities ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 265 Variation Step VIII Seeing the I-dentities in the foreground, stay in the background and notice the Identities are floating in emptiness. Step IXExperience and feel the essential quality from the background. Step XSee the I-dentities and the emptiness as being made of the same substance. Highlighted Case Example Barbara, age 35, is facing a divorce after 15 years of marriage. For years she has given herself up in an attempt to \"take care of him.\" It might be said that she fuses with his wants and desires as a defense against her own nothingness. This is another case whereby the reabsorption of I-dentities cannot occur in one session. Rather, trances and I-dentities which cover her trauma must first be taken apart and looked at. In order to demonstrate this, the theoretics will be discussed before the case so that the reader can see the direction I am going in.",
  "last_phrase": "To live the Tao of Chaos and reabsorb I-dentities into Essence, it's crucial to understand your own trances and traumas. Don't mistake superficial nothingness for the vastness of your own Essence. Instead, stay in the background and notice how the Identities are floating in emptiness, experience the essential quality, and see the I-dentities and emptiness as made of the same substance. With this approach, you can slowly take apart and look at trances and I-dentities that cover your trauma and move towards healing."
