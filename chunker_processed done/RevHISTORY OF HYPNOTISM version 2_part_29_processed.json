  "content": "Nevertheless, I think that it is a mistake to underestimate the prehistory of psychical research. Many of our precursors were far more competent than we typically give them credit. The real difference between early researchers and a modern laboratory worker is that the latter adheres to standardized procedures, whereas the quality of the 19th century experiments essentially depended on the quality of the people who conducted them. Thus, in some cases, researchers clearly intuited the standards of modern laboratories: conditions were varied to note their effect on the phenomena, conjurers were invited to assist the demonstrations, real-time notes were taken, with descriptions covering the sessions in considerable detail. I could readily cite comments and observations written around 1840, which could have been written today. In any case, even if they did not yet know how to conduct impeccable experiments – Impeccable according to our standards – in the 19th century, investigators had a very rich base of phenomena at their disposal, and have left us an incredible amount of data to question and analyse, to sift and sort through. These old cases could reveal much more if we knew how to ask the right questions.",
