  "title": "\"Magnetic Healing Techniques: Drawing and Repelling Passes\"",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text features practical advice for magnetic operators, including specific techniques to maintain distance between the operator and subject, how to neutralize magnetic influence on a subject's extremities, and how to repel a subject's magnetic influence altogether. The text also emphasizes the importance of making direct passes from above downwards, and discusses a creative way to practice these passes. Overall, the text provides valuable insight into the world of magnetic healing and manipulation.",
  "content": "Formulate your Will by imagining you are really pushing him from you, and keep your distance by stepping towards him, as he is supposed to step backwards. These passes are very effective, and can be made either in front, or at the back of the Subject, when he is under your influence. A very sensitive, or often-Magnetised person can be influenced by them, when in the normal conscious state, and in another room to that occupied by you, without him in any way being informed of your intention. As before stated, the Magnetic emanation has a tendency to ascend, therefore all Direct-Passes must be made from above downwards. To practise these passes, it is as well to cut a piece of thin paper about six inches long, by two wide. Fold it down the long centre, and fix one half to the wall, so that it will have the appearance of a miniature shelf, which shelf projection should be cut so as to hang in a kind of fringe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing Direct-Passes and using a target for your passes, you can cultivate your eye and hand coordination to become an effective magnetizer. These passes can be made from above downwards, and a sensitive person can be influenced without being aware of your intention. Remember to keep your distance and step towards your imaginary Subject, while imagining pushing him away."
