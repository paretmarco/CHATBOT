  "title": "\"The Theory of Four Elements and Its Impact on Health and Perception\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the theory of the 4 elements was discussed as a way of understanding the implied order of health and temperaments. It was explained that a lack of balance between these elements could result in an imbalance in perception and overall disfeatured reality. Now, the concept of \"separation of levels\" is explored, whereby the perception of time becomes more tranquil, allowing for a more intense experience of reality. This idea is important in the context of understanding how different levels of perception impact our experience of the world.",
  "content": "The theory of the 4 elements is a map having its basis in the organs of the body, and thus helps us harmonize it. It enables us to understand the implied order while it manifests in every individual at the level of health and temperaments. How the “separation of the levels” impacts on the way time is perceived One of the first effects of the separation of levels is the inception of a change in the perception of time. Time appears to be “more tranquil”, as the number of impressions which reach the brain simultaneously, without mutual superimposition on one another, is increased. Whereas, during a state of focalized attention, sensory impressions reciprocally blur with each other, what occurs instead when we separate the levels is that we live in the reality in a more intense fashion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the theory of the four elements can provide us with a map to harmonize our bodies and comprehend the order it implies in our health and temperaments. By separating levels and living in the reality more intensely, we can tap into the power of quintessence and achieve a higher state of balance, akin to the concept of \"sensorium commune\" of Franz Anton Mesmer."
