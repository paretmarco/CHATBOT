  "title": "\"Attaining Dissolving Power: The Path to Self-Expression and Clarity\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author delves deeper into how the attainment of dissolving power can only occur by relinquishing the individualistic ego and letting chaos choose. They introduce Franz Anton Mesmer and how he saw tensions and problems as blocked energy that needed to circulate again. The author also discusses the separating of bodily density and spiritual ties through the use of the universal solvent or regal water. This leads to the attainment of the salt of harmony, which allows for energy-based harmony and the expression of oneself. The process involves paying attention to one's own energies and can be successful with multiple participants.",
  "content": "What that signifies at a practical level is that we ought to become conscious of this energy, and allow it to circulate and then vanish, precisely the way a wave disappears into the infinity of the sea. Moreover, the bodily density ? and the ties which bond one’s spiritual side to it must be overcome through a solution or a dissolution. In the view of Basilio Valentino, such separation must be earned through the use of the universal solvent or regal water 48, also called vitriol, to wit, through the clear awareness of this direction. This preliminary process, besides, makes it easier to attain the next element: The salt of harmony H. We can then allow ourselves to be guided by this harmony (symbol H) which we intuitionally recognize to be deeply inside ourselves. That element can then finally find an outlet for self- expression. This corrresponds to an energy-based harmony. The process involving more than one participant can be successfully actualized by paying attention to one’s own energies.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by becoming aware of and allowing the circulation of our energy, separating ourselves from our bodily density, and living in the present moment without distractions, we can attain a new form of ourselves that is less enslaved to mechanical impulses and can perceive reality in a clearer way. This process is symbolized by the attainment of the salt of harmony and the RULE, allowing us to move beyond our current limitations and achieve our full potential."
