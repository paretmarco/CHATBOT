  "title": "The Four Elements and the Circulation of Life.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of the four elements and how they relate to different aspects of corporeal life. In this final section, we delve into the mechanism that sustains individual life and how it eventually comes to an end. The psyche of man, according to ancient beliefs, is a combination of the four elements. Fire, which burns with the ardour of Mars, represents the life force energy, while Earth corresponds to the physical body. Water symbolizes bodily fluids that transport life, and Air represents the breath of life. The text discusses how these elements interact and how outside factors stimulate internal fire to grow. Lastly, it implies that the earthly crust becomes harder, and the reserves of liquid run out, signifying the end of life.",
  "content": "Earth acts as a porous base, a recipient for Fire, which is fanned by Air, and fed by Water as if it were oil. These last two elements must be able to penetrate to the Fire at the core of the being in order to establish the circle of the life force. Stimulated by the outside Air, the internal Fire grows by feeding on part of the Water, which evaporates. The vapour then penetrates through the pores of the earthly crust and rises up into the atmosphere; but the cold makes it condense, clouds form and dissolve in the form of rain. This falls to the ground where it is absorbed and filters down to the centre again. This is the mechanism of the incessant circulation that sustains all individual life, and which would endure forever if it were not for the fact that the earthly crust becomes harder and the reserves of liquid run out. There is no Elixir of Life that would permit our physiological existence to be prolonged indefinitely. The Sage knows that he must die, and does not fear death, but submits willingly to it.",
  "last_phrase": "As the mechanism of the incessant circulation that sustains all individual life eventually comes to an end, the wise Sage knows that he must die and dedicates himself to guiding and directing his physical life. By avoiding excess and focusing on preserving his vital fluid, while also staying young in soul and spirit through service and love for others, he can postpone decrepitude and maintain his moral hygiene, ensuring his preservation."
