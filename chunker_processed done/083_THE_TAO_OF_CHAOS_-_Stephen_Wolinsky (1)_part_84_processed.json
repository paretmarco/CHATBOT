  "title": "\"The Paradoxical Understanding of Chaos and Order\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author touches upon the concept of the universe as an unfolding and enfolding of energy, space, mass, and time, as explained by David Bohm in his classic text, Quantum Theory. The author discusses how emotions, such as anger or sadness, have energy, shape, duration, and occupy space. Chaos theory's idea of phase space is also introduced, which refers to a system's state represented as a point in space. The understanding of chaos and order as interchangeable requires unlearning the concept of self and questioning its permanency.",
  "content": "Nothing can exist in the physical universe, or better said, in order for something to exist in the physical universe it has to have energy in it, it has to occupy space, it has to have a solidness, or mass and it has to have a beginning, middle and end, or time. For example, we are in a problem state, a thought, a feeling of anger or sadness; the emotion has energy to it that we all can feel. The anger has a subtle solidness to it, a shape so to speak. It has a duration, a beginning, a middle, and an end. And it has a space that it occupies. Space In Chaos Theory what is discussed in de- tail is the idea of phase space. \"Any state of a system at a moment frozen in time was represented as a point in phase space; all the information about its position or velocity is contained in the coordinates of that point. As the system changes in some way, the point would move to a new portion in phase space.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, everything that exists in the physical universe has energy, occupies space, has a solidness or mass, and has a beginning, middle, and end. Even abstract concepts like emotions have these characteristics. Understanding the concept of phase space can help us measure the space that an object occupies at any given moment. By applying these principles, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us."
