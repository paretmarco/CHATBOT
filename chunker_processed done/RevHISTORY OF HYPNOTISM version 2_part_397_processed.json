  "title": "\"What is the mesmerizing effect on patients and how does it alter their behavior?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text reveal the details of the mesmerism treatment given to two individuals. The medical notes, subjoined in the text, explain the ineffectiveness of the treatment carried out on them. The more appealing case is that of a little girl called O'Key, who in her Mesmerised state exhibits a new existence condition, language, and feelings of artlessness, ignorance and childhood, presenting a vernacular filled with peculiarities. Although her good sense appears lost under the influence, deep sympathy and tenacious memory remain.",
  "content": "The dialect she then gabbles volubly is scarcely English, thickly interspersed with \" what\" or \"whatten,\" and \"such\" or \"suchen,\" which seem, by the emphasis she imparts to them, to hold most important, places in her vocabulary as expletives and superlatives. In her ordinary state she appears an intelligent gentle little girl, without any peculiar defect in her language, very pale (the effect of repeated bleedings, to relieve continual headaches), and is said to be, notwithstanding her sufferings in this respect, possessed of an excellent temper and affectionate disposition. Under the operation of magnetism, all her good sense appears lost, but her good feelings remain in full force, and she evinces deep sympathy with some one of the pupils present, in whom she takes a particular interest. … Her memory in the trance appears remarkably tenacious on some points—a perfect blank on others.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while magnetic trance can induce amusing behavior and a shift in language, it also reveals the tenacity of memory and the strength of the patient's empathy. While the language she uses during her trance may be scarcely English, she retains an affectionate disposition, making it a complex phenomenon to consider."
