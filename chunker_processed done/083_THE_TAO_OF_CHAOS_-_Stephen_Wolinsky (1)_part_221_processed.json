  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the therapist helps the client discover the power within themselves by turning their identities around to see that the power they seek is within, rather than outside. The client ultimately feels calm and powerful after experiencing the power of Essence. This concept of invulnerable vulnerability and the power of Essence is reminiscent of the Bhagavad Gita, which is referenced by the therapist in this case.",
  "content": "Client: They can feel that. Therapist: Now, ask the I-dentities if they would be willing to be reabsorbed back into the Essence \"back there\" as you feel the power. Client: They are absorbed. Therapist: How do you feel? Client: Calm and powerful. Conclusion In this case she was \"looking for power in all the wrong places.\" By having the I-dentities turn around, the power, which is Essence, is experienced. In this case, since she had a Yoga background, I reminded her of the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna (personal Essence as therapist) says to Arjuna (client) in reference to Essence, \"Swords cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it.\" This means that the power of Essence, cannot be cut, burned, or hurt in any 180 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS way. Hence it leaves a person feeling an invulnerable vulnerability. Invulnerable because it cannot be hurt; vulnerable because there is total openness and exposure.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by reconnecting with the client's Essence and shifting the focus from the performer/personality to the invulnerable vulnerability of their true self, the client was able to feel calm and powerful. This reminds us that true power cannot be obtained through external validation or appearances, but through embracing our essential selves."
