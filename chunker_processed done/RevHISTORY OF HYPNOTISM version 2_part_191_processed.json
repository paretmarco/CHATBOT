  "title": "\"How to Relieve Pain with Simple Hand Movements\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the author explores the significance of intention in magnetic practices for pain relief. The technique of waving hands to dispel pain from the top of the head is elaborated upon, and the concept of non-verbal suggestion is introduced. The importance of incorporating gaze to achieve quicker, stronger results is also discussed. The author provides examples of using magnetic passes to alleviate pain in the head and shoulder, which shifts to other parts of the body as the equilibrium is restored. This text provides valuable insights into the power of intention and non-verbal communication in magnetic healing practices.",
  "content": "In our experience it is only with the concomitant use of the gaze that the strongest results are achieved. In this case results are achieved in a few seconds. Without the gaze the methods requires more time. For example, if one has the headache, owing to the tendency of the blood to the head, if the forehead be hot and the feet very cold, by making a few passes from the head to the feet, and others along the legs, the head is relieved and the feet become warm. If one has a pain in the shoulder, and the magnetizer makes passes from the shoulder to the end of the fingers, the pain will descend with the hand: it stops sometimes at the elbow, or at the wrist, and goes off by the hands, in which a slight perspiration is perceived: before it is entirely dissipated, a pain is sometimes felt in the lower part of the bowels. Magnetism seems to chase away and bear off with it what disturbs the equilibrium, and its action ceases when the equilibrium is restored.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetic passes combined with the power of gaze can provide fast and effective relief for various bodily pains and ailments. While the causes of these phenomena may be elusive, the results speak for themselves. The simple method of Deleuze has proven to be a life-changing tool for those with physical limitations, offering promise and hope for a brighter tomorrow."
