  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author emphasizes the idea that the emptiness we often feel is not a bad thing, but an indication that there is something right with us. The personality structure we develop serves as a defense mechanism against this inner emptiness, which is a trace of Essence that we should explore instead of resisting. In the last part of the text, the author focuses on self-diagnosis, explaining the importance of recognizing our I-dentities and trances, and how we can reabsorb them into our personal Essence instead of trying to change our personality. In this section, the author will demonstrate how to diagnose the strategy a person uses to defend against the emptiness and how to reabsorb I-dentities back into personal Essence.",
  "content": "What you feel in your life is the continued attempts, through various strategies, to defend against this emptiness. This means that the enneagram or Character is organized to defend against the emptiness. Unbeknownst to the personality structure the hole is a gateway into Essence. Consequently, these structures are defending against themselves, the deepest part of themselves. Let us begin then to first diagnose the strategy the I-dentity uses, and then to demonstrate the reabsorption of I-dentities back into a personal Essence. Self-Diagnosis As we move through structures it is important to be able to recognize and know our I-dentities and trances so that we can process through them and have them reabsorbed into Essence. It is important, therefore, to not get caught up with the personality with the aim of changing it. Simply put, do not try to change your personality and make it more \"acceptable\" 144 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS or \"healthy.\" Rather, notice that the organization of I-dentities around the body was a function of human development. Therefore, change would be trying to resist a function. Our goal is to notice possible combinations of I-dentities and their goals, and reabsorb them into the Essence of our real selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding our I-dentities and their defense mechanisms is crucial for the reabsorption of our true personal Essence. Rather than trying to change our personalities, we should focus on recognizing and processing through them. By allowing our personal emptiness to be reabsorbed by Essence, we can reorder the chaos and resistance in our lives to create a harmonious and fulfilled existence."
