  "title": "The Independent Nature of Sensory Perception and Consciousness",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, we explore the relationship between sensory perceptions and conscious recollection. The author argues that sensory perceptions may exist for such a short time that they leave no lasting impression, meaning that in deeper forms of hypnotism, there is often no recollection of what occurred. Attention is necessary to form conscious ideas from sensations, and it's generally agreed that the cerebral hemispheres are the seat of higher mental operations like attention, but how they interact with lower sensory and motor ganglia is not well understood. Additionally, the author notes that conscious awareness of sensory impressions is not required for them to affect the brain, and that repeated processes can become habitual and performed without consciousness.",
  "content": "A man in a reverie may have many impressions of sight or of hearing of which he has been really unconscious. On the other hand the cerebral apparatus may be so attuned with the recipient portion that if the latter receives a message the former sympathetically responds. For example, a mother's sound sleep is disturbed by the slightest cry of her child, although loud sounds of other kinds may not awake her. It would appear then that impressions on the senses and the consciousness of impression are two separate states which may occur in a manner independently; that is to say there may be purely sensory operations, in which consciousness is not involved, or there may be the conscious repetition of old impressions, or what is called memory. Now it is a law of nervous action that processes which at first are always of a conscious kind may by repetition become so habitual as to be performed without consciousness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our senses and consciousness are two separate states that can operate independently. Our brains can output unconscious movements based on familiar sensory impressions, and it's a natural law for these conscious processes to become habitual and reflexive over time. We can harness this ability to learn new skills and make them effortless through repetition and practice."
