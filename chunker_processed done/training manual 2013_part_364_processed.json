  "title": "\"The Importance of Developing Presence and Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this philosophical discussion on self-fulfillment, the importance of developing the gift of presence is emphasized. The text asserts that the more we develop our presence, the more we can separate emotions, thoughts, and body to connect with our essence. The central point of this essence is represented by the center of the cross or the \"quintessence.\" The discussion continues on how man can elevate and integrate himself to reach a sublime level of awareness of the world. The last 200 tokens discuss the necessary energetic processes and tools such as breathing, four keys, and the \"charges\" exercise to move forward in this journey.",
  "content": "Imprisoned by the earth, it thus turns into ego, which lies at the root of the word “egotism”. This selfishness has to be transcended by a greater connection to the whole. It is possible to push the elevation and reintegration of the “homo totus”, of the total man, even further, until both reach a sublime level wherein man might truly become aware of the objective (and quantum) reality of the world as well. In order to attain this subsequent degree of elevation, it is necessary to rise through an additional series of energetic processes. This theme is found both in the Western and the Eastern traditions.108 The departure point of Dante’s ascent is the mountain located in the Purgatory, at the summit of which Eden is perched, only for him to further climb upwardly after reaching such point. Breathing and the four keys we spoke about at the begin of this manual can be the tools. Continue your path adding to your practice the “charges” exercise.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, transcending our egotism and connecting with the whole is crucial for elevating and reintegrating the total man. To reach a sublime level of awareness of the objective reality of the world, additional energetic processes must be undertaken using tools like breathing, the four keys, and the \"charges\" exercise. By becoming present in our bodies and discovering a new way of looking at reality, we can alleviate pains and sorrows and achieve a higher level of consciousness."
