  "title": "Exploring Identities in Therapy: From Inadequacy to Fulfillment",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores a therapy session where a client's feelings of inadequacy and emptiness are unpacked. The therapist guides the client to peel back layers of self-identification to uncover a unifying sense of emptiness that brings peace and calmness. The therapist prompts the client to ask different parts of themselves what they seek most in the world - reassurance, peace, serenity, and wholeness. The last 200 tokens focus on the therapeutic technique and how the client connects with the empty space to find a sense of serenity and wholeness.",
  "content": "Therapist: Enter into the peaceful calm emptiness, and notice how the emptiness at the pelvis is the same emptiness at the stomach and the same emptiness at the head. Client: Yes, there is one emptiness and it is like I can be in the emptiness and look out any one of or all three of the holes. Therapist: Good, now ask the obsessive I-dentity in the head, from \"back there.\" \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: Reassurance. Therapist: Ask it, \"If you felt reassurance, what would you feel?\" Client: Calm and peaceful. Therapist: Now ask the worthlessness I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more that anything else in the world?\" Client: Peace. Therapist: Now feel the peace of \"back there\" and go to your stomach and ask the overeater, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: Serenity. Therapist: Ask the loneliness, \"What are you seeking more than anything in the world?\" Client: Wholeness. Therapist: From \"back there\" feel the wholeness and serenity of the empty space.",
  "last_phrase": "Find out what your different identities are seeking and bring peace and wholeness to your emptiness through this exercise."
