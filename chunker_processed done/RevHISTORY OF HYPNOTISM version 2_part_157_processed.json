  "title": "\"The Importance of Developing Sensitivity in Animal Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we will delve into the different \"points\" that magnetizers attempted to prove and doctors sought to disprove during the time of Mesmer's school. While the doctors ignored the curative effects, the \"higher\" phenomena became a side issue that overtook the former. These phenomena included seven areas of exceptional sensory acuity experienced by somnambules, such as lucid vision and foresight, self-intuition, and accurate memory during magnetic states. Additionally, we will discuss the Chevalier de Lausanne and the significance of developing sensitivity in animal magnetism, where animals possess greater physiological sensitivity than human beings.",
  "content": "They possess the faculty of self-intuition, that is to say, a clear insight into the normal or abnormal condition of their own organization, and they perceive and describe with exactness the internal condition also of those with whom they may be in rapport. “5th. They appear endowed with a knowledge beyond that which they ordinarily possess, and prescribe for themselves, as well as for those with whom they are in rapport, remedies for such complaints as they may be afflicted with; and these are generally found successful. “6th. Their lucid vision often extends beyond the present existence, and they foretell, with circumstantial minuteness, events which will happen in connection with their own organization; even the day and hour the very moment-when such predictions will be verified is accurately specified. “7th. Upon recovering from their somnambulism, they remember nothing which occurred during the magnetic state; but when again thrown into somnambulism, the memory between the two magnetic states is continuous.\" The Chevalier de Lausanne and the importance of developing sensitivity Animal Magnetism relies on our sensory acuity. Animals have more sensitivity than human beings.",
  "last_phrase": "Developing our sensory acuity can help us tap into a world of sensorial messages that we usually filter out. Through animal magnetism, we can learn from animals, who possess more sensitivity than humans, and cultivate our own ability to perceive the internal conditions of others and ourselves with greater clarity. By recovering and expanding our intuition, we can enhance our understanding of the world around us and improve our ability to predict events and prescribe successful remedies for ourselves and others."
