  "title": "\"Symbolic Geometry and the Mason's Set Square\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the symbolic meaning of the perfect square and the importance of attaining balance and harmony within oneself. Now, we shift our focus to the Set Square, which is formed by joining two right angles of equal length. This construction plays a central role in geometric symbolism and is fundamental to the work of Masons. The Square represents stability and solidity, while the Compass represents creativity and expansion. Through the combination of these two tools, the Mason is able to create a harmonious and balanced whole, which is a reflection of the self.",
  "content": "Nothing that is arbitrary or approximate may remain: everything must be regulated, coordinated in terms of numbers and proportions, in accordance with the laws of this Philosophical Geometry, which we discussed at the beginning of the chapter, and which is the fundamental Knowledge (Gnosis) of the Adept. The Set Square As we have noted previously, we can consider the Cross and the Square as being formed of two right angles between sides of equal length, which have been joined by their vertices or by their ends . These indications are enough to give an idea of the constructive role played by the right angle in the combinations of geometric symbolism. Every construction, in effect, derives from linking two opposites, represented by the vertical line (energy, action, strength) and the horizontal line (extension, inertia, resistance). The mason is called to set in motion that which, by nature, is immobile. He gathers together everything that is dispersed, combines and then works his materials, with the aim of creating a stable and solid whole.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Set Square is a fundamental tool used in masonry to ensure that stones fit perfectly to create a stable and solid structure. It symbolizes the Master's mission to maintain harmony among collaborators, reconcile opposing elements and observe discipline. By following the principles of Philosophical Geometry, masons create constructions that are regulated, coordinated and proportional, ultimately achieving their purpose of setting in motion that which is naturally immobile."
