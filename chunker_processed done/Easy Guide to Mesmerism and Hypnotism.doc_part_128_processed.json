  "title": "\"The Power of Mesmerismus in Healing Illness: A Case Study\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author shared a personal anecdote where Mesmerismus helped cure a dying man who suffered from sleeplessness and had lost all interest in life. In the final 200 tokens, the author comments on the skepticism towards Mesmerismus and its effectiveness in healing patients. The author asserts that if \"coincidence\" or \"imagination\" can do so much good, then it's a pity that it is not more frequently tried. The dying man, who didn't believe in Mesmerism, was only called for treatment when his medical advisers said there was nothing else they could do. Despite his initial disbelief, the treatment worked wonders, and he was up and about in just two weeks.",
  "content": "A friend of the family had tried monotonous sounds—namely reading slowly page after page of an uninteresting book, in a most lullaby fashion; all no use. I commenced operations at the bedside at ten, and the patient was soundly asleep at eleven. In a fortnight's treatment, the dying man was up, dressed, and going about, to the pleasure and happiness of all concerned. Suggestion, say some, purely imagination declare others, while “coincidence” and “expectancy” are called in to explain the foregoing by some and, “fudge” will be the opinion of the learned (?) sceptical and egotistic. By all means, if “coincidence” or “imagination” can do so much good, it is a pity that it is not more frequently tried. The patient was satisfied, the friends-pleased, and I earned and received a handsome fee... I might here state this gentleman did not believe in Mesmerism—was rather opposed to the idea. I was not called until he was informed by his medical adviser “they could do nothing more for him.” It was only a question of a few more days—the end.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, although the efficacy of Mesmerism or suggestion may be debated, the fact remains that in the case presented, it had a profound effect on the patient's well-being. If other unconventional methods can bring about such positive results, it is certainly worth considering their use to alleviate suffering and improve quality of life."
