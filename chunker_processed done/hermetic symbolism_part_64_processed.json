  "title": "\"The Symbolism of the Swastika, Square, and Freemasonry\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we discussed the symbolism of the Swastika and its relation to the sacred fire that creates and breathes life into matter. We also explored how the four elements - Earth, Air, Fire, and Water - correspond to the right angles of the Swastika, and how they govern the chaos of the beginning. In this final section, we will examine the connection between the Swastika, the Square, and the elongated Rectangle, while also delving into the positive lessons of philosophy that the Initiate receives when walking in a rectangle.",
  "content": "Both act on the passivity (the horizontal line of the Cross), to determine the alternative movements of the life force. The other two elements (Air and Water ) are, on the contrary, the passive results of an active intervention: one corresponds to volatility, lightness, that has reached the greatest heights, where is maintained, the other is begotten by the deposit of heavy sediments that have become denser, and eventually solidified . Tartar The theory of the Elements as we have just presented it is completed by the approximations that can be established between the Cross , the Swastika and the Square . This last symbol is also linked with the elongated Rectangle , which for the Freemasons represents the plan of the room in which they carry out their work. It is the symbol of limited space, within which perceptions can be experienced. It extends from west to east and north to south. The infinite universe is reflected in it, in miniature, reduced to the artificial dimensions of the World that we can comprehend. When the Initiate, leaving from the West, learns to walk in a rectangle, he receives a positive lesson in wholesome philosophy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbols of the Cross, the Swastika, and the Square all represent different aspects of the theory of Elements. The elongated Rectangle associated with Freemasonry symbolizes limited space within which perceptions can be experienced. By walking in this rectangle, the initiate receives a positive lesson in philosophy, learning to verify their beliefs and avoid hasty actions. The Tartar, representing the predominance of passivity, is the Rough Stone that must be transformed by the artist into a perfect Cubic Stone. In summary, these symbols offer valuable guidance for those seeking to achieve personal transformation and growth."
