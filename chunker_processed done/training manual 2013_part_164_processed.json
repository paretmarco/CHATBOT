  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Dr. Hannish described 3 exercises that should be practiced daily to correct any physical deficiencies and promote good health. In this section, he introduces a fourth exercise that should be done after meals, to aid digestion, improve concentration and refine taste. He declares that by practicing these exercises in the recommended order, they will help overcome obnoxious habits such as eating meat, drinking alcohol, smoking, and taking drugs. Dr. Hannish emphasizes the importance of natural means to achieve a normal state of body and mind, without resorting to the use of unsightly corsets or deceptions.",
  "content": "You will notice that in case a meal has been a trifle too heavy, this exercise will act as an excellent relief from dyspeptic and indigestive conditions; yet this is not the main object, although even to this end it would be worth observing. It will aid in the digestion of food. It will help in concentrating your mind that you may take a more proper attitude in the observation of your labor, but the main point is your taste will become more refined, more sensitive, thus enhancing the sense of smell, which is accomplished in part by the preceding exercise. Dr. Hanish says: You now have four exercises to go through with daily, to be taken in the order as given. We now proclaim that this exercise in connection with the previous ones, followed daily, will aid in overcoming all obnoxious habits, such as flesh-eating, liquor-bibbing, smoking, chewing, drugging, and the like.",
  "last_phrase": "Adopting these daily exercises can bring about remarkable changes in both body and mind. By refining your senses and building a stronger character, you will be empowered to overcome harmful habits and enhance your overall well-being. With dedication and consistency, you can reach a level of purity that will enable you to enjoy a more harmonious existence, free from negativity and toxicity."
