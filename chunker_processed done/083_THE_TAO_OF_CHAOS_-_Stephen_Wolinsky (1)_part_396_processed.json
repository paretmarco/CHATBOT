  "title": "\"Understanding Living Systems: Emergent Properties and Self-Organization\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of self-organization and its impact on the way we understand living organisms. Prior to the emergence of self-organization, sciences could only deal with systems that were either totally ordered or completely random. However, with the arrival of this new concept, we can see that life itself is the entity that organizes the environment. The authors Maturana and Varela present a complete view of living beings from a systems perspective. They explain that a living cell creates order and separates itself as a unity from the environment through the creation of a membrane. The text goes on to explore how a living system must maintain its organization of processes to stay alive.",
  "content": "Already with the single cell life is a process of creating order. A living cell separates itself as a unity from the rest of the universe by creating a membrane. Within the membrane the processes of the cell are such that the end product is itself. Thus in the very essence of life we have the appearance of a strange loop. And although the cell takes in nutrients and energy, and eliminates waste, nothing on the outside effects or changes the basic loop or cyclic organization of processes within the cell as long as the cell stays alive. In other words the cell is closed to information from the outside. Darwin actually first proposed this notion when he declared that a new organism could not inherit acquired characteristics. How then does a living cell do the things we observe about its behavior? In response to perturbations from outside the cell, the cell modifies its structure to maintain the organization of processes and its internal set of relationships. This is a basic law of biology according to Maturana, that for a living system to stay alive it must maintain its organization of processes. The beauty of this approach is that it generalizes to all aspects of living organization.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the fundamental law of biology is that for a living system to survive, it must preserve its organization of processes. This concept applies to all aspects of life, from single-celled organisms to complex nervous systems. A living system modifies its own structure to maintain its internal set of relationships, making it resistant to outside influence. Understanding this law can inform the development of strategies to promote the health and longevity of organisms, from studying disease to promoting ecological fertility."
