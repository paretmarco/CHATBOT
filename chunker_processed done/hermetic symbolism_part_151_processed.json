  "title": "\"The Meaning and Symbolism of the Pentagram in Initiation.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text highlights the importance of possessing companionship, the rule, and the lever to carry out what laymen consider miracles. The master identifies with the Great Architect of the Universe for divine intervention. It compares religious mysticism with high-level initiation and elaborates on three successions paths to achieving modifications. The text emphasizes the need for true repentance and dying for a cause, which Masonry imposes twice - in the Chamber of Reflection and during complete initiation. The Microcosmic Star, also known as the Pentagram, plays a vital role in symbolizing sovereign and fair will when drawn correctly but represents base instincts when reversed.",
  "content": "Possessed of the Rule and the Lever, the Initiate lifts up the world â€“ the moral world, naturally, which is on the other hand the only one that it is important to raise. The Master What, then, will the Master do? He will identify with the Great Architect of the Universe, in order that this will act on him and for him. Evidently it is a thing of pure mysticism, I agree. But this tends to prove that religious mysticism, in the final analysis, is in concordance with high level initiation. Proceeding by three successive paths, called purgative, enlightening and unifying, the mystic is no less logical in the imposition of his modifications, which, if they have been well understood, would achieve the same end as the initiatic tests. To be mortified - to truly repent - means dying for something. Death is imposed on us twice in Masonry, once at the beginning of our journey, in the Chamber of Reflection, and later, at the moment of definitive and complete initiation in the Middle Chamber. This second death corresponds to the fulfilment of the Great Work.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, high-level initiation requires a pure mysticism towards identifying with the Great Architect of the Universe in order to act on and for the Master. The overall objective is to get rid of radical Egoism based on the renunciation of personal desires, in fulfillment of the Great Work. Masonry signifies the retraction of the legendary, universal sin of Adam, and achieves the same end as the initiatic tests."
