  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the alchemical concept of the Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem, which translates to \"Visit the depths of the Earth and by rectifying, you will find the Hidden Stone.\" Now, we delve deeper into this symbol and its connection to Masonic principles. The stone is a metaphor for the initiate's transformation and is shaped into a cubic form to possess the virtues of the Philosopher's Stone. However, achieving this requires a perfect master to carry out the transmutations. In this final part, we discover the consequences of leaving the subject to themselves and the subsequent Air test.",
  "content": "With its meticulously formed right angles, this Stone possesses, at least in potential form, all the virtues of the famous Philosophers’ Stone. But it requires one in full possession of the Art, a perfect Worker or Master, to carry out the transmutations.” Naturally, these transmutations are not applied to the creation of treasure in a purely conventional sense. Their achievements are far more precious than those which might be tempting to the greedy. Left to himself, deprived of all support, the subject locked inside the Philosophical Egg quickly falls prisoner to melancholy. He languishes: his strength deserts him, and decomposition begins. Under this influence, that which is subtle becomes separated from that which is dense. This is the first phase of the Air test. After descending to the centre of the Earth, where the roots of all individuality lie, the spirit ascends: it rises up, freed from the caput mortuum that lies blackened in the bottom of the hermetic vessel. This residue is represented by the recipient’s clothing, which he has to cast off in order to emerge peacefully.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the transmutations involved in the creation of the Philosophers’ Stone require a perfect Worker or Master to unleash its potential virtues. This practice is not aimed at personal gain, but rather the achievement of something more precious. Though the process can be challenging, the end result is a metamorphosis that frees the spirit from its dark cocoon and allows it to ascend to greater heights. Just like the storm that drags the reckless subject back to where they started from, the circulation within the alchemist’s closed vessel leads to a transformative journey that brings one back to their true essence."
