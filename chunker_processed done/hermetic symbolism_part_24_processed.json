  "title": "\"The Philosophy of Creation: Exploring the Origin of Substances\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the primordial substance that gave birth to all creation. It refers to the definition of a philosophical salt by Dom Antoine Joseph Pernéty, giving it a deeper interpretation. It then relates it to Tiamath, the mother of all life, and the force of infinite dynamism that fills the Universe. The last part of the text discusses the mystery of Creation, symbolized by a dot in the Circle. It concludes with a reflection on the power of symbolism and the human spirit's ability to conceive of the ineffable.",
  "content": "When the human spirit evokes the image of a bottomless Abyss, calling it Apsú, or the abyss of infinite depth personified by Uranus, it always finds itself obliged to fill the vacuum that it has imagined with Tiamath or with Rea, deifications of the etheric substance that is spread out in this infinite space. This substance is still not something, that is, a concrete thing that can be distinguished from other things: it is the Essence of something, prior to any kind of distinctive refinement. If we imagine this substance as dead we are mistaken, because it is fundamentally alive and Tiamath has, with good reason, been lauded as the mother of all life. To fill the Universe requires unequivocal vibration, without pause, under the influence of the force of infinite dynamism. The vibrations are transmitted integrally in a homogeneous medium, such as that attributed to the primordial substance. Nothing stops the waves of the cosmic Ocean, which stays uniformly fluid without anything forming within it. What, then, is the mystery of Creation? How was the sterility of made fertile? Graphically, the answer is easy, and is given by marking a dot in the Circle: .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ancient sages imagined the creative movement of the Cosmos as a radiation emanating from a center point and spreading endlessly through space like the ripples from a stone thrown into water. The True Light that they spoke of is not the physical light that strikes our retinas, and the essence of creation is the vibrational force of infinite dynamism. Understanding this can help us better comprehend the mysteries of our Universe."
