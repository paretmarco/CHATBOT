  "title": "\"The Power of Presence: Exploring the Symbolism of a Point Within a Circle\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the concept of awareness takes center stage as a defining factor in the universe, according to both the Ancients and Quantum scientists. The symbol of the point within the circle is explored, representing a point of individuation and creation, paralleling the concept of light. As we observe light, we are seeing a potential for all colors and forms. The ideas of observation and the dyad observer-observed are discussed, where observation has a significant impact on reality. This section ties together the various concepts explored in the text, emphasizing the importance of awareness and observation in understanding the world around us.",
  "content": "And the point inside the circle is a specific symbol of the sun . This parallelism with light is very useful. Seeing the light has always been a symbol of illumination bringing a person into a higher dimension. When we observe light directly, we observe a whole, where all colors and all forms are potentially possible and present at the same time. As this light comes into our room, it will be reflected from objects and arrive to the eye. We will then have the impression of seeing the objects. But we are seeing in reality light, the same light that when looked at in the lamp is in an undefined state. This state gets defined reflecting on objects and so we obtain information. The dyad observer observed A fundamental point in quantum science is the fact that observation affects reality. As we measure something, in reality we are modifying its true undefined nature. So we have a dyad observer-observed, where the observer modifies reality, fixates it, in looking at it. When the hermetists speak of the same light inside and outside they express a very similar concept. A light is our being conscious in the world. And the world around us is light that we observe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbol of the sun inside the circle represents the parallelism with light, which has always been a symbol of illumination that brings us to a higher dimension. By observing light, we obtain information about the objects around us. Our observation affects reality, and by transcending the dyad of observer and observed, we can penetrate into a different reality where everything is interconnected, and there is pure perception."
