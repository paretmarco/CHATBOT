  "title": "Exploring Trauma through Third-Person Storytelling",
  "first_phrase": "In this part of the therapy session, the therapist and client explore the first part of the traumatic experience - the sexual assault. The therapist guides the client to observe the event in the third person and break it down into segments, handling each part separately at a point of intensity. The therapist asks the client to create the little boy in the movie thinking and feeling certain things, with the aim of observing the memory rather than being in it. The session reaches a climax with the cousin commanding the little boy to suck on his penis.",
  "content": "Therapeutic Note This is a breaking point of intensity or a bifurcation point, the first part of the trauma, and the first part to explore. It is my aim to have him tell the story third-person so that he can observe the movie first rather than be in the movie. The movie is broken down into segments, and each segment is handled separately at a point of intensity (bifurcation point). Therapist: What thoughts are the little boy creating? Client: What's going on? Therapist: Create the little boy in the movie thinking \"What's going on?\" Client: Okay. Therapist: What feelings are the little boy creating? Client: Confused and scared. Therapist: Create the little boy in the movie being confused and scared. Client: Okay. Therapist: What fantasies are the little boy imagining? Client: He feels frozen, and isn't imagining anything. Therapist: Create the little boy in the movie freezing his body and stopping his fantasies. Client: Okay. Therapist: Okay now let's allow the movie memory to roll again. Client: Well, the cousin is laughing and telling the little boy to suck on his penis.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, exploring and processing traumatic experiences can be a difficult but necessary step towards healing. Taking a third-person perspective during therapy sessions can allow for a more objective and less overwhelming experience, while breaking the experience down into manageable segments can help to navigate intense emotions."
