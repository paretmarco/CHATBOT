  "content": "Our aim is to assist you in gaining the knowledge you seek of the ancient and powerful traditions of true magnetism, mental fascination, and magnetic hypnotism; in each of them we were initiated by one of the last known teachers of these techniques. These techniques are useful in therapy, in personal relationships, in professional relationships, and in every other social situation you can think of. These techniques help in the development of charm and personality as well as generalized overall human development. These powerful techniques are based on a specific use of energy; they are the western path of what in the East is kundalini and similar techniques. Behind these techniques lies a very ancient secret school. We can trace this secret school back to the centuries before the Ancient Romans' time. Aristotle, Plutarcus, Plinius, Marsilius Ficinus, Simone Maiolo, St. Thomas, Albertus Magnus, and many others acknowledged the existence of such a power. Even the Greek tradition of the power of the Medusa is connected to this power. This ancient school was always kept secret. The most powerful and expert members never gave out the entire system to anyone.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ancient and powerful techniques of true magnetism, mental fascination, and magnetic hypnotism can be instrumental in personal and professional relationships, and overall human development. Marco Paret and Max Tira's 15-year immersion in an ancient secret school has resulted in a unique and effective system that sets them apart from modern psychology. By exploring these techniques, you can develop your personality and charm, and tap into an energy system that has been acknowledged throughout history."
