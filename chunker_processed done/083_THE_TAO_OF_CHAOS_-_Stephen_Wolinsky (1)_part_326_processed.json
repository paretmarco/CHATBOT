  "title": "\"Using Symbols for Temporary Dissociation in Trauma Processing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed how symbolic representations can be used as temporary dissociators to cope with trauma, but ultimately trauma must be explored for complete processing. In this last part, the author emphasizes that therapists should not use new trances or symbols to create further dissociation from traumatic experiences because it only adds another layer of dissociation. The author warns against the clinical use of hypnosis in processing trauma because it only provides temporary relief and does not cure the trauma in the long term. The focus should be on finding out who you are and processing trauma directly.",
  "content": "For example, for years I used Ericksonian approaches to hypnosis and psychotherapy with people suffering from issues of incest. The client always felt better at the end of the session and for a few days. Why? Hypnosis is for pain control, not for processing trauma and discovering who you are. Consequently, a client would leave and \"feel better\" because they were not feeling and dissociating. We all need to understand that if we enter into the Quantum Approach the focus is to find out who you are. The purpose is not to feel better right now because you might not, although ultimately you will. For now, however, it can be said that the clinical use of hypnosis with incest survivors is a temporary step to coping. It is not a long-term cure, because trances are being added on the trauma so the client cannot feel it. But the trauma will rear its ugly head either directly or in sublimated ways until the trauma is confronted. Why? Because the stored-up excess energy will pull and fixate the attention of the observer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while hypnosis can provide temporary relief to survivors of traumatic experiences, it is not a long-term solution. The focus should be on uncovering and processing the trauma, rather than dissociating from it. The first step towards psychological health is to be willing to experience whatever is going on internally, without judgment or avoidance. By embracing the Tao of Chaos, individuals can begin their journey towards healing and self-discovery."
