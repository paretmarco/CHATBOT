  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the benefits of a breathing exercise that utilizes the lungs fully. Now, let's focus on the muscles and their role in increasing magnetism. By tensing opposing muscles simultaneously, we can generate energy that helps stimulate the mind and body. Exercise 23 involves stretching and inhaling while exercise 3 focuses on clenching fists and rising up on toes. These exercises only take a minute each but can have a profound impact when practiced consistently.",
  "content": "This energy is released later, and can also be increased to higher levels with subsequent contractions. The kinds of tensions to create energy have a particularity: we tense simultaneously a muscle and his antagonist. Therefore, we do not have movement, but simple contraction. Some scholars have supposed that this type of muscle tension, to a psychological level corresponds to a \"not done action\"65. Whenever we do an exercise of this kind, we load a unit of energy. You can increase the tension up to vibrate. In addition, the vibration creates a pace that can ease, by resonance, the creation of brain coherence. Besides, to more simple level, muscle tension stimulates the brain and creates a similar mental tension, able to enhance your thought. Exercise 23 Inhale and stretch arms before in front and then alongside, but not the hands, they remain relaxed. Exhale slowly. Repeat several times. Exercise 3 Rise up on your toes inhaling; meanwhile clench fists, but only those, arms should be relaxed.",
