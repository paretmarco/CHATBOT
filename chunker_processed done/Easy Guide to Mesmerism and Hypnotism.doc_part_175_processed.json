  "title": "\"The Power of Mesmerism in Healing Diseases\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author emphasizes that although women have a natural gift for healing, they should not take on the responsibility of treating severe illnesses unless they have the necessary health, determination, patience, and sympathy. The author believes that women make excellent healers and magnetizers for other women, just as men do for other men. However, the professional healer, both male and female, should be trusted and esteemed as honourable in their work as physicians or ministers. The author concludes by stating that the power to heal diseases is the gift of gifts and that mesmerism can be beneficial for more than just nervous diseases. Dr Hitchman, a medical professional, has confirmed that Mesmerism can also cure cancer and other diseases. The author herself has seen mesmerism reduce colds, allay inflammatory symptoms, cure bilious attacks, reduce white swelling, and relieve the agony from cut or crushed fingers and limbs.",
  "content": "All other phenomena educed or evolved by the mesmeric process, however startling or interesting, are valueless unless they contribute to the requirements of the healing art. Dr. Hitchman, M.R.C.S., Eng. (formerly of Guy's Hospital, London, late of Leeds Cancer Hospital, and of, Liverpool), many years ago informed me “that it was erroneous to suppose that Mesmerism was only beneficial in nervous diseases. He had seen it arrest the progress and finally cure cancer,” and I know, from personal experience, that diseases other than those for which it has been most frequently used, I have known it to reduce colds, to allay inflammatory symptoms and to cure bilious attacks, to reduce white smelling, a painful disease of the knee joints and equally to relieve the agony arising from a cut or crashed finger or limb. Many of these cases were undertaken under medical supervision, while others, the larger number, were those which came to me in the course of professional work, either attracted by lectures, or recommended by the friends of those who had at some previous time received some benefit from Mesmerism.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the mesmeric process has been found to be beneficial in treating a wide range of ailments and diseases, not just limited to nervous conditions. Its usefulness is not limited to just physical conditions but also extends to reducing the painful symptoms of certain diseases. The steady, persevering, and judicious use of the mesmeric process through methods such as massage, shampooing, and kinetic movements can offer relief and can even contribute to curing some ailments."
