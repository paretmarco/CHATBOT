  "title": "\"Positive and Negative Mesmerism: Effects and Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the concept of mesmerism, a precursor to modern hypnosis, is discussed. Mesmerism is discussed in terms of its positive effects (such as the resuscitation of individuals who were believed to be dead) and its negative effects (such as calming and ventilating). The methods by which positive and negative mesmerism impact the body are also explored, with negative mesmerism being the safer of the two. The text concludes with a specific example of how negative mesmerism can be used to revive a person who has experienced physical trauma.",
  "content": "Of this kind, are the mesmeric strokes employed in awakening persons from a state of somnambulism, as well as all those manipulations known as \"calming\" and \"ventilating.\" The safest and simplest means of discharging the excess of vital power accumulated in some portion of a vigorous organism, consist in the application of negative mesmerism by means of the right hand with its extended palm, held parallel to and about an inch from the body, and carried by a rapid motion from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. [5] The more rapidly this motion is made, so much the more effective will be the discharge of vital force. In a case of apparent death, for instance, occurring in a female previously healthy, [6] whose menses were suddenly arrested at their commencement, by some violent emotional disturbance, the excess of vital force, probably accumulated in the precordial region, is discharged and restored to its equilibrium throughout the organism, by means of a rapid negative stroke of the hand, which will be followed by immediate resuscitation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the practices of mesmerism and clairvoyancy have been known to exhibit extraordinary abilities, they have also been fraught with charlatanism and quackery. However, the techniques outlined, such as negative mesmerism, can be safely and effectively used to discharge excess vital power and alleviate anxiety. As with any field, it is important to distinguish between genuine practitioners and those seeking to exploit the credulous."
