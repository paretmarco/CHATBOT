  "first_phrase": "In the first two-thirds of the book, the author discusses the implicate order and how to recognize it through exercises and case studies. In this final part, the author delves into the idea that chaos has a natural order, and by becoming one with it, beauty and interconnectedness can be found. The author references a Zen teacher who became enlightened by going with the flow of traffic, highlighting the notion that resisting chaos leads to chaos. To recognize this natural order, one must reabsorb frozen persona, and the author will touch on this by exploring Essence as the second implicate order. The author then addresses the history of psychology, which has been continually searching for ways to remedy the human condition.",
  "content": "Chronic Problem States and Chaos The development of a diagnosis and treatment for the recognition of the order of chaos requires a reabsorption of frozen, stuck I-dentities or false selves that were created and whose purpose was to resist chaos. In the second two-thirds of the book, we will look at Essence as the second implicate order, and how by touching Essence, the personality can be reabsorbed. Stated another way, personality is the explicate order, Essence the second implicate, and the implicate is the quantum field. This will be discussed later in Section III, with exercises, and individual case studies. Psychology Psychology has a brief history. Although the early Greek philosophers searched to remedy the human condition, the world of psychology has been dominated by philosophies placed in action. By this I mean that each branch or school of psychology demonstrates a map or pathway to release the suffering of the human condition, and for the most part psychology is a soft science. Although psychology has scored many successes in areas of human behavior from sexual dysfunction to family therapy, from phobic relief to chronic depression, the art of psychotherapy has left many questions unanswered and has left many dissatisfied customers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while psychology has made significant strides in helping individuals with various mental health issues, the effectiveness of psychotherapy can vary based on the individual and the brand of therapy used. The key to success may involve a reabsorption of the false self and a deeper understanding of the implicate order through exercises and case studies, as discussed in this text. Ultimately, finding the right therapy and therapist may take some exploration, but the potential for relief and a better life experience is within reach."
