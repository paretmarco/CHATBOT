  "title": "\"The Power of Rhythms and Central Energy Activation\"",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text evokes the importance of rhythms and coherence for enhancing the quality of human life. This last part introduces the concept of awakening the central energy with the example of Animal Magnetism. The author highlights the importance of producing energy to achieve remarkable results and introduces the symbol of the triangle as an appropriate representation. To understand activating both hemispheres better, the author suggests using software for left/right brain hemispheric synchronization. The journey towards awakening central energy is a process that requires effort and persistence.",
  "content": "This energy is life force and it is the basis of foremost results Franz Anton Mesmer in one of his works says that Animal Magnetism is like a Fire. Magnetizing is bringing the fire out of a person. There is a fire inside a person that we ignite with our fire. Fire is energy. In order to get mostly results we must produce energy. Such energy is central, and physiologically it could be compared with the interplay of two hemispheres. The symbol of the triangle is the most appropriate for representing it. A first step in order to understand what ?activating both hemispheres means?, could be grasped through a particular software for left/right brain hemispheric synchronization. It could be used for sleeping induction or just before going to sleep at night. That will start moving you in a new direction and get you started on your journey. This is only the beginning, and it is useful only for the most materialistic ones.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and utilizing energy in all its forms can be a powerful tool for personal development and growth. By synchronizing the hemispheres of our brain, we can ignite the fire within and start on a path towards a more fulfilling life. However, to truly delve into the depths of energy and its potential, we must continue to explore and understand the principles that govern it, such as the sulphur and mercury in alchemy and the prana or qi in Eastern practices."
