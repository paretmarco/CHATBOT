  "title": "\"The Importance of Tellurism and Grounding for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores various concepts related to energy and healing in the context of Indian philosophy and hypnotherapy. It highlights the importance of grounding oneself in the earth, as emphasized by Dr. Kieser's concept of 'Tellurism'. The capacity of animals to feel a magnetic rapport with the earth is central to his theory. Being grounded has shown to enhance and accelerate hypnotherapy's results. This section expands on the above and dives deeper into Dr. Kieser's work and ideas.",
  "content": "I shall quote Kieser in his own words: \"Animal magnetic influence or animal magnetism upon our earth is the (intentionally caused) reciprocal action of two living organisms upon each other, in which not the solar but the telluric force preponderates and decides\" (Vol. I, p. 7). \"The activity which brings about the magnetic rapport is the animal magnetic force. It is, therefore, the living activity of the earth or its representative, the telluric force itself, which emanates in different forms during the reciprocal action between two things from the magnetizer upon the somnambulist. It is not anything material, but the force or spirit of the earth which, in the different forms of the magnetizer, either as metallic, vegetable, animal or human spirit, is always the expression of the telluric spirit\" (Vol. I, p. 18). \"As the telluric force is the most universal force of the earth, and no earthly stuff can escape the power of its influence, it follows that all earthly bodies must be conductors of the telluric force\" (Vol. I, p. 318).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Kieser's concept of animal magnetism emphasizes the living activity of the earth and its universal force, specifically the telluric force, that emanates in different forms during the reciprocal action between two living organisms. These concepts enabled Kieser to heal, showcasing the practical benefits of understanding the power of the earth's living force."
