  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Animal magnetism was discussed as a powerful tool in treating chronic diseases that were otherwise untreatable. Now we dive into situations where animal magnetism was able to treat afflictions that were brought on by acute and intense illnesses. Three cases are mentioned: a gentleman with a chronic disease, a lady recovering from fever, and a boy with tertian ague. Despite its effectiveness, Animal Magnetism had its detractors who considered it a diabolical agent.",
  "content": "I was one day present when this fainting was coming on, and, in presence of her sister and brother-in-law, I tried to make application of animal magnetism: I had scarcely begun to operate, when she quickly recovered from the fainting, as though she had been awakened by fright, and from that moment she gradually recovered, with the assistance of medicaments usual in such cases, and is now in perfect health. \"A boy in Groningen, fourteen years of age, was suffering under tertian ague about eight weeks: after having given him all medicaments usual in this case, without effect, he was recovered by applying animal magnetism‚Äù Animal magnetism seen as a diabolical agent Because Animal Magnetism was very effective, some of its enemies however, persisted in regarding this power as supernatural, and believed it to be evoked, either consciously or unconsciously, by the magnetizer; and in either case this exercise of supernatural power they declared to be exceedingly wrong, whether the miraculous help came from God or from the Devil.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism was once perceived as a diabolical agent, despite being a very effective method of curing diseases. It was said to evoke supernatural powers of either God or the Devil, making it a controversial topic among religious circles. However, as science advanced and new theories emerged, people gradually began to understand the natural principles behind animal magnetism, and it is now widely accepted as a legitimate and practical cure for some ailments."
