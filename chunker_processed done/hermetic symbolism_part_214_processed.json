  "title": "\"The Process of Separation and Spiritual Development\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the process of achieving a higher level of consciousness through separation of levels was discussed. By separating our thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, we become eligible to attain a new form of ourselves that perceives reality in a clearer way. This process enables us to create a more developed version of ourselves by being present and avoiding distractions. The text then uses the symbolism of distillation to describe how the quintessence, or the essence, of a person is attained. Once distilled, this quintessence allows us to maintain a state of detached indifference in every moment of our lives. However, it is important to overcome our compulsions before achieving this level of consciousness.",
  "content": "It is necessary to repeat this operation a number of times, so as to eventually distil the finer spirit of our own selves. Hermetism resorts to the symbolism of the distillation which is aimed at achieving the quintessence (the fifth essence) of a liquid. The raw material is heated up inside the alembic. The dense part is separated from the subtle one through evaporation. The thin part that has evaporated is then condensed and separately distilled, and, in the last phase of the process, one ends up obtaining spirit (aqua vitae), the life water, the burning water. This water is a higher level of consciousness. We might define it as the essence” of the person 50. Some people live out this state of detached indifference to the blows of life only during moments of meditation, and yet the key lies in successfully maintaining that state through every moment of one’s life. Once it is adequately distilled, in fact, this quintessence makes allowance for such perpetuity. As regards the duration of this process, it is indispensable that all compulsions must have been overcome. Compulsions are nothing other than excessive developments of what would otherwise represent faculties of the spirit.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of distilling the finer spirit of ourselves requires repetition, patience, and discipline to overcome our compulsions and achieve a higher level of consciousness. By conjoining this distilled quintessence with previously shelved aspects of ourselves, we can be reborn as an amphibious being, living both an ordinary and higher spiritual life with calmness and confidence, reflecting the symbolism of the hermetists."
