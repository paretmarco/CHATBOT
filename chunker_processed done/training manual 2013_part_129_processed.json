  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of linear time and the role of our \"programming mind\" in craving and fear. Now, we will delve into staying present and how it strengthens our actions. We will examine the power of rhythms in brain coherence and the organic development of time. Finally, we will look at awakening our central energy through the concept of the Secret Fire. Keep these ideas in mind as we move forward to understand the value of staying present and attaining a deeper sense of self-connection.",
  "content": "THE POWER OF CERTAIN RHYTHMS Some rhythms can help to stay in the present. Rhythms also help brain coherence, and in particular the most common is the 2 seconds rhythms as well as the 1/6 seconds rhythms (which is typical of muscular tensions). At this point, the experience of time itself assumes another quality, moving in another dimension. It is no longer a « chronological time », nor becoming or « flowing » rather it is a rhythmic time, which is not indifferent to what goes on within it, rather it restores itself in terms of an organic development, in which an intimate connection of meaning links the Self and its experience, rendering the separate contents as integral parts of a whole coming out by way of ? the meaning of life?. DEVELOPING YOUR CENTRAL ENERGY Awakening both hemispheres and both parts of your mind and being The Principle of the Secret Fire Basic concept : there is an energy to awaken in us.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating rhythms into your daily routine can enhance your present moment awareness and promote brain coherence. By connecting with the rhythmic time of your body, you ignite your own internal fire and awaken your life force energy, leading to a deeper understanding of your Self and a more fulfilling experience of life."
