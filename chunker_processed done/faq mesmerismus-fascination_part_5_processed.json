  "title": "\"Fascination Therapy: Achieving a State Beyond the Trance\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of this text, the author explains the workings of the unconscious mind and the importance of the look-centred therapy. Now, in the remaining 200 words, the author delves deeper into the method of fascination used in therapy, which allows the patient to enter a state of \"non-thinking\" where their symptoms disappear. The patient is fascinated through creating a trance-like ocular level, bringing them \"beyond the trance\". The majority of people are gripped by their own mental mechanisms, perpetuating their problems. The look-centred therapy intervenes in these mechanisms and uses the idea or concepts that beset the patient via those mechanisms. The second method of therapy is to contact the symptoms directly.",
  "content": "Within that context, for a period of time that might last longer or otherwise, the fascinated person attains a state which is devoid of consciousness of the “ego”, that is, the totality of our mind and our automatic mental programs. The person concerned would then be “beyond the trance”. The Fascination which is carried out on a person is indisputably something that acts at an ocular level, by creating a kind of “trance” for the subject on whom one is operating. However, we are in a state of trance even in other situations. We might for example be captivated by objects or by persons, or even by our thoughts in which we drown. The majority of people is indeed totally gripped, “fascinated\" by their own mental mechanisms. This is the reason why the same mechanisms are invariably reiterated, and why the problem is preserved and perpetuated. By means of the look, we thus intervene in the very mechanisms which produce the “fascination” by means of ideas or concepts that beset the subject via these mechanisms themselves. There is yet another way of proceeding: This second method consists in contacting the symptoms directly.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to overcome the grip of our own mental mechanisms and break free from the trance-like state that often holds us captive, it is possible to utilize two methods: intervening in the mechanisms themselves or directly contacting the symptoms. By using either technique, it is possible to free ourselves from fascination and reshape our mental patterns, ultimately leading to greater self-awareness and personal growth."
