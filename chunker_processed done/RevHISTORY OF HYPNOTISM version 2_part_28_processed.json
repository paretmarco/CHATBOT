  "content": "But, as Eraclitus (the Greek philosopher) said: “if you don’t expect the unexpected you cannot find the truth”. When we operate magnetically, we should grant ourselves the chance “not to know”. As Lao- Tse says: “Knowing that you do not know is a great thing, while thinking that you know is a disease”. In Magnetism we must also open our minds to psychic research. Prof. Meheust, a French university professor who recently received a prize from the University of Sorbonne for his studies on history of Animal Magnetism wrote12: “Psychical researchers have sustained more criticism than researchers in any other field. This is probably why they tend to increasingly reject qualitative studies, and underestimate the early history of their field. For instance, for them, the data gathered in the middle of the 19th century, in France and in England, are difficult to interpret, insofar as the requirements of modern laboratory were little understood and controls were inadequate. For the most part, conjurors were not systematically invited to control the somnambulists, descriptions of the sittings were not taken verbatim, and of course, investigators didn't have the luxury of tape recorders or cameras.",
