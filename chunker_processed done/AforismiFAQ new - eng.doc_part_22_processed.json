  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part, the text focuses on the empirical measurement of magnetism and its effectiveness in healing. The article mentions several researchers who have studied the existence of human energy and its impact, including the relationship between magnetism and prayer, and the paranormal. The text highlights that despite the difficulty of conducting experiments in this field, there are hundreds of documented cases of successful healing and positive results since the times of Esdaile. The text suggests that the inward being is more aware of a person's desires, and the phenomenon leads to the materialization of the operator's vitality and their desire to promote well-being in their patient.",
  "content": "There are several researchers who have undertaken studies on the subject of the existence or otherwise of a human energy and its effects. These studies are interrelated with those which have been conducted on the efficacy of prayer or the whole field of paranormal activities in general. The circumstance that a number of serious scientists have concerned themselves with the issue, and even gone as far as writing books on it, already represents an interesting point. Not a single one of the scientists who in his finding had verified the existence of concrete results ever changed his opinion subsequently. As a norm, experiments are very difficult to bring off in this field, inasmuch as the effects of a superior wellbeing produced by magnetism are the consequential result of increased vitality, which might be translated as a combination of vitality, serenity and happiness that has been brought about by its practice. Measuring magnetism is like attempting to reach some unequivocal measurement of a personâ€™s happiness. Present-day science is not only unable to measuring these concepts, but even to define them. There are in any event hundreds of documented cases of positive results having been obtained and of successful healing having occurred since the times of Esdaile.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while there may not be a concrete way to measure or define the existence of human energy or the efficacy of practices like mesmerism, many documented cases have shown positive results. Instead of focusing on unraveling the mechanisms behind it, perhaps it's more useful to focus on what works. Regardless of the eastern or western approach, both use something similar to the chakra system."
