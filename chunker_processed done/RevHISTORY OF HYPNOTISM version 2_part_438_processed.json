  "title": "\"What is Mesmerism and how should doctors approach it? A critique from Esdaile's perspective.\"",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the true function of a physician as well as the misconceptions surrounding Mesmerism. Esdaile argues that doctors misunderstand Mesmerism, leading to the erroneous testing for insensibility as the only way to prove it's efficacy. He emphasizes that doctors must experiment and study the subject carefully to understand its true nature. Esdaile condemns medical quacks who arrogantly ignore possible cures and whose patients suffer as a result. He urges the public to learn about Mesmerism to avoid being misled by misinformation.",
  "content": "But, in my estimation, the genuine medical quack is he who, professing to cure disease, yet allows his patients to suffer and perish by ignorantly, or presumptuously, despising any promising or possible means of relief.\" Esdaile condemns the absurdity of making insensibility to pain the only test of the reality of Mesmerism. He says that doctors have heard of mesmeric coma, and, knowing nothing of Mesmerism, imagine it to be always present, and are ignorant of any other criterion, for the doctors do not know Mesmerism when they see it. He says:- \"I am anxious that the public should know what Mesmerism really is, in order that they may know it when it comes before them, and be no longer deluded by ignorant and interested quasi-descriptions of it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important for both medical practitioners and the public to have a clear understanding of what Mesmerism really is, and not be misled by false descriptions of its effects. Furthermore, it is imperative that doctors attempt to develop the effects of Mesmerism on their own patients, to fully comprehend its potential benefits and ensure that no promising means of relief are ignorantly or presumptuously disregarded."
