  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the first level of developing attention, called Simple Attention, and the first exercise associated with it. It is crucial to perform this exercise to improve concentration by keeping your eyes open without blinking for at least fifteen minutes. Now we'll take a look at exercises 5 and 6. Exercise 5 involves reading a page of a book every day without closing your eyes while exercise 6 is about staring at an object without blinking while gradually getting closer to it. These exercises can be beneficial for learning how to hypnotize efficiently.",
  "content": "Try to gradually increase the time during which you can remain without blinking: you can start with a few tens of seconds and then gradually increase up to a minute, then start to add a minute at a time until you reach a quarter of an hour. Always rest a bit your eyes keeping them closed after doing this exercise. In theory, you could keep them closed for the same period and work, at that time, on visualization, trying to review what you have just observed. Do not ever rub them with your hands, not to irritate them. This exercise is very helpful, one of the best for those who want to learn how to hypnotize quickly and efficiently. Exercise 5 Make a great effort to read a page of a book every day without ever close your eyes. You will see the results already achieved with the previous exercise improving. Exercise 6 Another exercise you can do often and with many benefits is staring to an object at short distance, getting closer to it always staring, never lowering eyelids.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises such as gradually increasing the time without blinking, reading without closing your eyes, and staring at an object can greatly improve your gaze, focus, and ability to hypnotize. Remember to rest your eyes and avoid rubbing them to prevent irritation. With dedication and practice, you can achieve a powerful and impressive hypnotic gaze that will give you a valuable advantage in various settings."
