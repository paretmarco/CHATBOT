  "title": "\"The Influence of Light on Health and Psychic Research\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the effects of light on the human body and its role in maintaining and restoring health. It discusses how the visual cortex and metabolism are affected by light, and how the absence of light can cause disease. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves deeper into how the human body requires light for its sustenance and how respiration is directly affected by its presence or absence. The text portrays how darkness can cause a general depression of vitality in both man and beast, and how the absence of light can lead to changes in physiological respiration, assimilation, and excretion.",
  "content": "When the sun, the great source of light, approaches the horizon and leaves the world in darkness, consigning it thereby to the analyzing physicist, it seems as though the whole of nature were lulled to sleep. Its voices are hushed, and man and beast are slowly rocked to rest in the cradle of universal silence. The evidences of activity gradually disappear. Darkness supervenes, and with it a desire to rest becomes manifest throughout the living creation. The human organism, which is a part of living creation, shares in this general depression of vitality. Its machinery works under lower pressure. Physiological respiration becomes more superficial, assimilation less active, and excretion more sluggish. The more finely organized the structure, the more characteristic the change which comes over it in the absence of light. Only the lower forms of life, the fungi and other varieties of micro-organisms, thrive, as their greatest antagonist, light, has temporarily withdrawn from the field of contest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the absence of light brings about a natural inclination to rest and a decrease in physiological functions in human beings and other highly organized structures. However, psychic research has discovered a unique technique that utilizes magnetism and light to alleviate emotional problems. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli de Cressac's role in metapsychic experiments from the 1960s provides a promising path for the exploration of the unexpected in this fascinating field."
