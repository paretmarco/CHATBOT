  "title": "The Importance of Responsible Practice in Mesmerism and Hypnotism",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, Coates reflects on his personal experience and acquaintance with renowned Mesmerists and their impact on his career. He mentions Dr. Roth's admission of the facts of Mesmerism and notes that experiments with hysterical and diseased patients should be deprecated. Coates urges medical professionals to focus on curative and elevating experiments. He expresses concern about the mal administration of Mesmerism and Hypnotism that besets continental hospital practice and hopes such attempts will be put down in England. He makes a brief reference to the fact that some techniques of Magnetism never reached England.",
  "content": "Medical men have a weakness for experiment. I should very much regret to see the sneer and abuses arising from the mal administration of Mesmerism and Hypnotism, which are now and have been besetting Continental hospital practice, extending to this country. Experimenting with hysterical and diseased patients is at once to be deprecated in the strongest possible language. Experiments should not be indulged which are not essentially curative and normally elevating in character. This is not done, I am sorry to say. The gratification of Idle and pedantic curiosity, in the operations of these modern Hypnotists, appears to me to be the predominating motive, the CURATIVE, being left to the accidental provings. I look to the honour and common sense of the Faculty as a whole to put down any such attempts here. I rejoice to note the fact that much of the continental practice is impossible here, owing to the stamina or difference in the constitutions and mental capacity of the people at home compared with those abroad. Editor's Note: in England the complete work of the original school of Magnetism was never diffused. Therefore, some techniques never arrived there. Maybe this explains Coates' expression.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to prioritize the well-being and curative nature of medical experiments, rather than giving in to idle and pedantic curiosity. The risks and ethical concerns related to Mesmerism and Hypnotism must be taken seriously, and any attempts at maladministration of these practices must be put down by the medical community. We must also acknowledge the differences in medical practice and patient constitution between countries."
