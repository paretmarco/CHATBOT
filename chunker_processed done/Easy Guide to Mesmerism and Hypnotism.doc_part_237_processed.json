  "title": "\"Phreno-mesmeric Process: Manipulating the Brain and Behavior\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the differences between communication with the brain through direct contact and indirect mechanical suggestions. Now, let's dive into the phreno-mesmeric process, introduced by Dr. Spencer T. Hall, which involves putting the subject in a deep sleep to stimulate different organs of the brain, giving rise to specific psychological states. This method was studied by various scholars, including Dr. Elliotson, Braid, and Sergeant Cox. Stay tuned to gain insight into the fascinating experiments conducted by Dr. Hall and how different organs of the brain, when stimulated, can provoke various responses in the human psyche.",
  "content": "Excite “Imitation,” and “Language.” Foreign languages will be repeated verbatim, without hesitation or flaw, the subject having no knowledge of the language thus employed. Excite “Language,” “Tune,” and “Mirthfolness,” the subject will probably sing some amusing and witty song. Excite, “Language,” “Veneration,” and “Spirituality,” the face of the sensitive will be reverential, devotional, and flooded with hallowed light; while his invocations to the Deity will be most impressive and devout Excite “Destructiveness,” and energy, activity, possibly passion and temper, will be manifested. “Acquisitiveness” will indicate a desire to have, while “Benevolence” a desire to give. The special direction of either will depend upon what other organs are excited in unison therewith. To allay the cerebral excitement, blow steadily on the organ or organs affected. Drs. Elliotson, Braid, Spencer T. Hall, Mr. Atkinson, W. Jackson, Sergeant Cox, and others paid considerable attention to this branch of experiments. Dr. Spencer Hal is naturally the authority whose experiments were to me the most interesting.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of cerebral excitation to trigger specific behaviors and responses in individuals is a fascinating area of study that has garnered attention from numerous experts such as Drs. Elliotson, Braid, and Spencer T. Hall. By exciting different parts of the brain, researchers have been able to induce a variety of responses ranging from foreign language imitation to devotional expressions, and even destructive behaviors. It is remarkable that blowing steadily on the affected organ(s) can help to alleviate cerebral excitement. Understanding this neuroscience can be useful in various fields ranging from performance arts to therapy."
