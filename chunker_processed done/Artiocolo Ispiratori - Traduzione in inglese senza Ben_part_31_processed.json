  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed an exercise to recharge the cervical plexus. Now, the focus is on extending the same technique to other plexuses. To recap, in the exercise, you have to visualise the cervical plexus and two imaginary threads originating from the solar plexus and reaching this point. The exercise is repeated for a few minutes, and you must imagine seeing the red point from the cerebellum. In the final 200 tokens, the author explains how the same system can be applied to other plexuses using the same technique.",
  "content": "By the stage when you eventually close your eyes, you must imagine yourselves seeing the red point as if from within, the way you would have done had your eyes been located in the cerebellum (the nape). As this part of the exercise is more tiring, do not exceed ten seconds the first times you implement it. After you have repeated it a few times, you will carry it out more capably. Once that subsequent level is reached, you will perceive the point of the cervical plexus with greater intensity. Shortly thereafter you will feel a sensation of heat once more, whereupon you will have to feel that you have managed to accumulate such a strength that, should you wish, the like of a laser beam might flash out from you. The recharging session should not last more than three or four minutes. Recharging other plexuses: The same system applying to the cervical plexus shall be used.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the Mesmeric and Symbolical Method into your self-care routine, especially when done with a group and utilizing symbols, can allow for rapid healing. Remember to take your time with the exercise, not exceeding more than ten seconds at first, and use the same system when recharging other plexuses. By harnessing this energy, you can feel a greater sense of strength and unity with those around you. Using the powerful tool of harmonious groups can be an impactful part of restoring oneself."
