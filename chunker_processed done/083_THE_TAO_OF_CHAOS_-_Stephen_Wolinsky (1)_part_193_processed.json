  "title": "\"The Tao of Chaos: Understanding the Observer-Personality Unit\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explored the concept of the observer fixating its attention on the outward personality to avoid the trauma of loss of being and emptiness. In the concluding section, the text delves deeper into the idea that the observer and personality are not separate units, but one unit, and argues that observation alone cannot free the observer from personality. Instead, the observer must turn its attention inward and reabsorb into Essence, where the subject and its object merge into one, leading to objective consciousness. The text is based on the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff and invites the reader to explore this controversial concept.",
  "content": "This means to enter into Essence, the observer and its object, i.e., the I-dentities clustered together called personality, must be reabsorbed back into Essence. In this way the (subject) observer and its object, the personality, disappear. What emerges is the essential quality of observation with no object. Stated another way, the subject observer and its object (the personality) are reabsorbed back into Essence so that there is the essential quality of observation with no object. How can there be observation with no object? Because, at the level of Essence, the subject (observer) and its object (personality) merge and become one. This, G.I. Gurdjieff called objective consciousness; observation with no object. For this to occur, the observer turns its attention inward toward the emptiness, rather than its habit of facing outward, thus it sees itself. More simply put, when the observer fixates its attention and faces outward, personality is there. When the observer fixates its attention and faces inward toward emptiness, Essence is there, and the observer (subject) and its object (personality) dissolve in Essence. The observer fixates attention outward to resist Essence (itself).",
  "last_phrase": "In essence, the reabsorption of the observer and its object into the essence leads to an observation with no object, awareness with no object to be aware of, and a knower without knowing about. This process allows the observer to face inward, dissolve in its essential nature, and eliminate the personality. Thus, the Real I or the I I emerges, creating a path towards true consciousness."
