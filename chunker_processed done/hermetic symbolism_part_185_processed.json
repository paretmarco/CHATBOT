  "title": "Symbolism in Alchemical Art: An Interpretation",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes an intricate painting of an adept surrounded by symbols and tools of alchemy. The adept's companion, a priestess of Isis, represents his faculties of intuition, while the basket of tools and stones may symbolize the pursuit of the Philosophers' Stone. The flame represents the emotional illumination of philosophical truth, and the bag represents the sense of compassion. Lastly, the mirror held by the priestess reflects images of the astral light. This last part, consisting of 200 tokens, highlights the dynamic and animated nature of these images and their impact on human thoughts and desires.",
  "content": "The flame that burns by the left shoulder illuminates the spirit with its philosophical light, aiming for the emotions rather than for cold reason. There are, in fact, truths that have to be felt, because although they might be out of the control of strict logic, this does not mean they will stop weighing upon the heart with irresistible power. These are the truths that protect us from sterile scepticism, the destructor of all conviction. On the left hand side of the priest hangs a bag, alluding to alms, charity, the sense of compassion for your neighbour without which the most brilliant initiates would be nothing more than trumpeting brass and crashing symbols. The Adeptâ€™s companion, finally, holds a mirror in her right hand, which reflects images of the astral light. These images are alive: they run rings around imaginations, they provoke dreams, they feed on the thoughts that they engender, the desires that they stimulate and the aspirations that they fuel.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbols in this text point towards a deeper understanding of spiritual and philosophical truths that cannot always be explained through logical reasoning but rather felt through emotions. They remind us of the importance of compassion, charity, and the power of imagination in carrying out the Great Work towards enriching and perfecting humanity. These symbols serve as vehicles for the undying Tradition, reflecting the astral light that stimulates desires, aspirations, and the dreams that fuel our spiritual journey."
