  "title": "Understanding the Two Principles: Hemispheric Synchronization and Energy Circulation.",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we will delve deeper into the concept of bringing out the fire within a person and the importance of producing energy for optimal results. We will explore how activating both hemispheres of the brain is essential to achieving this and how it can be done through a particular software for hemispheric synchronization. But to truly understand this development, we must look to the principles of Alchemy that involve the union of two different principles - sulphur and mercury - which are also present in Eastern philosophies. Specifically, understanding the circulation of prana and apana in the Nadis and the awakening of kundalini inside the Sushumna.",
  "content": "To go further, we have to analyze it better through a deeper understanding of such development and union derived from two different principles which must be realized on all levels. The Two Principles In Alchemy there is a close contact between two principles, called sulphur and mercury. The first is male while the other one is female. This principle is also valid in the Eastern countries. In India, Nadis are channels of the subtle body thought to carry a life force energy known in Sanskrit as prana, or qi in Chinese-based systems. In particular prana (the active) is supposed to circulate inside a nadi called Pingala on the right of the spine. Apana (the passive) is supposed to circulate inside Ida, on the left of the spine. Inside Sushumna is supposed to circulate kundalini when awoken. The Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referred to the two hemispheres of the brain.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to harness the power of the two principles, it is important to understand their intricate workings, as seen in various practices such as alchemy and the ancient Indian practice of pranayama. By delving deeper into the subtle body and exploring the channels of prana, one can awaken the kundalini energy and balance the hemispheres of the brain through the stimulation of the Ida and Pingala nadis. Incorporating these practices into daily life can lead to a deeper understanding of the self and a harmonious union of the principles within us."
