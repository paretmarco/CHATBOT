  "title": "Understanding Hermetic Symbolism and the Philosophers' Stone",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the symbolism of different shapes, such as rectangles and squares, in various philosophical and spiritual contexts. It also delves into the idea of achieving spiritual perfection and the relationship between the physical and spiritual realms. In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses how the spirit can become free from the limitations of the body, developing extraordinary faculties that can lead to miraculous acts. The concept of miracles is explored within the context of individuals who have successfully obtained these extraordinary faculties.",
  "content": "It is, however, a fundamentally ephemeral state of perfection, because we begin to decline in the very moment that we reach the peak of the active force. Strictly speaking, our life is divided into a first stage of growth or gradual incarnation of the spirit, immediately followed by the progressive disincarnation of the spiritual origin. In reality, we divide human life into three phases, but in actual fact the ‘adult’ age also comprises the end of the period of growth, which is becoming more and more delayed, and the beginnings of decrepitude, although this phase is still not clearly manifest. As the spirit becomes free from the bonds of the flesh it begins to develop its own powers. The ascetics know of a state of detachment that is favourable to all the energies of thought and will. The intellect may become stronger and stronger, in proportion to the weakness of the body. Have we not occasionally seen old people, and particularly the dying, demonstrate an extraordinary lucidity of mind and spirit? With suitable training, extraordinary faculties are frequently developed. The individuals who manage to obtain them work miracles. They may stun the multitude with facts and acts that by common agreement are called miracles.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, as we contemplate the journey of human life divided into three phases, we witness the inevitable decline of the physical body but the liberation of the spirit. With suitable training, exceptional faculties can be developed, which may lead to remarkable achievements. The true initiate, however, seeks not fame but works silently towards the ultimate emancipation of the spirit. The symbol of the Philosophers' Stone represents matter that has been sublimated to uphold the manifestation of the spirit as it journeys towards absolute freedom."
