  "title": "\"Understanding the Theory of Four Elements and its Implications\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the theory of the 4 elements and how it can help us harmonize our body. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the impact of \"separation of levels\" on time perception and introduces the concept of \"quintessence.\" The quintessence, the fifth element, is the core concept that links the four elements together. It is comparable to the \"sensorium commune\" introduced by Franz Anton Mesmer, which refers to a higher state of balance beyond our senses.",
  "content": "We discover what is called “quintessence” « Homo Totus »= staying in more levels at the same time Developing the power of the quintessence On the edge of the circumference (from left to right clockwise): Hot – Dry – Moist – Cold Horizontally inside the circle: Air – Earth Vertically inside it: Fire Water The hub of the wheel there is the fifth essentia or quintessence, a term by which one seeks to indicate even the shared fundamental substance which contains those elements. 96 The “sensorium commune” and the “quintessence” This is a higher state of balance. It is possible for us to observe that a strong analogy exists between the concept of quintessence and the “sensorium commune” of Franz Anton Mesmer. According to Mesmer, the “sensorium commune” did not coincide “with any sense, only with the nervous system in its entirety”. It is therefore a meta-sense, a sense which lies beyond (from the Greek word meta) the other senses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of quintessence, along with the meta-sense of the \"sensorium commune,\" can help us reach a higher state of balance and perception. If we encounter a problem that we cannot solve with our rational senses, tapping into the quintessence may provide a useful solution."
