  "title": "\"The Power of Attention Training: Moving Beyond Fixations\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the fixations and character types that make up our personalities, as we constantly move from one fixation to another. This leads to an increased awareness and freedom, ultimately helping us cut the chains of our personality. In the final part of this text, attention training takes center stage, with a closer look at the concept of tension and how it affects us. The author, Hugh Milne, introduces the idea of a trance created by a fixation or focus of our attention, which leads to the blocking of all other resources. By understanding how attention functions, we can more deeply appreciate and take apart different aspects of our identities.",
  "content": "laIn the last chapter we looked at the ob- server/personality dyad and how it fixates its Clgattention and uses a particular strategy to re- =sist the trauma of the loss of being and the Imilperception of inner emptiness as a lack of something. Then we looked at the Identities or clusters of Identities of the observer/person- ality dyad. We explored how each I-dentity is Zfacing forward or outward in search of itself LIJ or its Essence. Unfortunately, as we have discovered, the observer/personality dyad is \"looking for itself in all the wrong places.\" To more deeply appreciate and take apart I-dentities, it is important to dive more deeply in the area of attention, and how it works. In Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology, I spoke of a trance be- ing created by a fixation or a shrinking of the focus of attention. Once that attention is shrunken and fixated on an object, a person, or an event, the observer goes into a trance, blocking out all other resources. In The Dark Side of the Inner Child the observer fixates its attention on the child and uses that created child state as a window from which to see the world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding how attention works and the fixation of attention, we can begin to shift our perception of reality from a limited and habitual view to a more expansive and authentic view from Essence. This inward shift can be the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, ultimately leading to healing and transformation."
