In the final 200 tokens, the author talks about the fundamental pairs of identities that organize chaos and create unwanted states. They explain how every attempt to organize chaos is a resistance to unwanted states, and how each fixation of attention is a strategy used to avoid trauma. The author invites the readers to explore the nine fixations of attention and their character types to discover who they are not.",
