  "content": "The phenomena obtainable by Animal Magnetism, have been observed from the earliest ages. It is probable that the ancients were well acquainted with them, that this knowledge, being kept secret, and perhaps used for bad, certainly for self interested purposes, by those who had the exclusive possession of it, had been lost, and that it was necessary to recover it, which was first effectually done, in great part at least, by Mesmer, although Van Helmont, and many others before Mesmer, had obtained glimpses of the truth. On the wall of a chamber, discovered among the antiquities of Egypt, where are hieroglyphics referring exclusively to medicine, a priest is represented in the act of magnetizing an individual. The ancients were well acquainted also with the phenomena of somnambulism; they discovered that it could be induced by certain mystic rites, during which, as will hereafter appear manifest, a principle unknown to them was evolved; and they placed implicit reliance on the lucidity which occurs in this state, and which they naturally enough ascribed to the direct interposition of some of their heathen divinities.",
