  "title": "\"The Enneagram and the Gateway of Emptiness: Reabsorbing I-dentities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we explore the concept of emptiness as a gateway to a higher level of being. The pulsation from unmanifest to manifest creates a natural gap where the I-dentity disappears, causing resistance and fear. However, this hole in our being is actually a passage into the Essence, and the challenge is to be willing to use it as a gateway. The author shares insights from Nisargadatta Maharaj and explores how the Enneagram can help reabsorb I-dentities.",
  "content": "The problem was that it moves so rapidly, the gap is not noticed. This gap, 138 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS which is a natural process, is where the I-dentity disappears only to re-appear an instant later. From the point of view of the I-dentity, disappearance into this gap is death, annihilation, the unknown, and chaos. Consequently, the I-dentity resists the perceived hole and perceived gnawing emptiness, causing more chaos, more pain, and more fear. The Emptiness as a Gateway It appears to the I-dentity that the emptiness is something to be resisted. Many clients report having a hole in their body or a hole in their being or a gnawing emptiness which they attempt to fill with food, drink, sex, work, or another person. This hole, however, is actually a gateway, a passage, into the much higher level of being, an order within chaos like sitting in the eye of a hurricane. This holy hole actually contains the whole Essence. The resistance to the holy hole is intense, and to begin to be willing to go through the hole of emptiness and use it as a gateway becomes the challenge.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the resistance towards the holy hole of emptiness is challenging yet necessary for entering the gateway to Essence and one's true self. By reabsorbing dysfunctional I-dentities, the individual can establish themselves within a higher level of being and live from Essence, paving the way towards Quantum Consciousness. Understanding the Enneagram can aid in this journey towards self-discovery and personal growth."
