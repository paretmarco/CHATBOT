The sleeper acquires the power of perceiving every sensation, bodily and mental, of his magnetizer. Nay, he often exhibits a like power in reference to all with whom he is placed en rapport, especially when this is done by contact.

Indeed, there appears to be no difference whatever between the two. He feels what is felt by the person en rapport with him, as truly as if the original impressions were made upon himself. He forms, for the time, a part of the person on whom the direct impressions are made, and all sensations, or many sensations, are common to both parties.‚Äù In the higher phenomena, we would even include healings that many times come about in a very unexpected way. Mesmer was the first in dilvulging a method for obtaining these healings.",
