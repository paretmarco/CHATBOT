  "title": "\"The Dyad Observer-Observed: Quantum Science and Hermeticism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the quantum science concept that observation affects reality. The observer modifies reality, fixating it by measuring it. The author discusses how the same Hermetic concept applies to our being conscious in the world, where the world around us is light that we observe. Now, in the final part of this text, the author explains how the concepts of Sulphur and Mercury relate to the dyad observer-observed and how we can achieve a quantum jump through reawakening the observer. Through this, we can penetrate a different reality and enter the world of possibles, where everything is interconnected and pure perception.",
  "content": "Observing it in quantum terms we create it And the two concepts of Sulphur and Mercury correspond very well to the dyad of observer and observed. Mercury is the secret of the art says Wirth. Because in overcoming this dyad, and coming to a place where the observed is no more such, even the universe is no more such, and we penetrate in a different reality. We could call it the world of possibles, as in reality the nature itself of the universe changes. It is no more a delimited cause – effect relationship, but everything get interconnected, and there is pure perception. But to achieve this quantum jump the observer must be reawakened. At the end there will be no more an observer. The dyad observer-observed will fuse. Sulphur (our spirit) is blocked in the prison of salt (the body). And mercury is external. But sulphur is some way is also encrusted on the salt. It refers to the blocked way (observer’s way) we have to look at the reality. The first step is to put away the incrustations, so to have a free way to look at the universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving a true understanding of the quantum nature of the universe requires a reawakening of the observer and a fusion of the observer-observed dyad. We must first purify ourselves by putting aside our personality structures and learning to be present. By doing so, we can penetrate a different reality and begin to understand the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. The journey may be challenging, but the reward is a deeper understanding of the world of possibles."
