  "title": "\"Smoking Cessation in 50 Seconds: The Magnetic Hypnosis Method\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores a method by which smokers can allegedly \"cure\" their habit in a single session that lasts only 50 seconds but really takes about 10 minutes. The advocate who designed this method, whose name is not stated, uses a simple technique of applying pressure on the client's forehead, head, nape, neck and sternum followed by a touch along the client's arms. In the last 200 tokens, the article quotes users' testimonials of how this method helped them quit smoking after a brief session. One user swears he has become a non-smoker after his 60-a-day habit was cured in such a fast way.",
  "content": "“With his eyes like two knives, he pierces me, though no pain is felt; he then touches my forehead and hair, and it is there that I felt a blast of heat. That was it. Since then, I swear! I really do not know what a cigarette is. From 60 a day I went down to zero” (Maurizio Ferrara). All he needs to make one forget cigarettes is a lightning fast session. An intense look is cast upon your eyes, and then the fondling begins: The head and the forehead first, via gentle pressures, followed by moving down the arms through propitiatory gestures, as if to chase an evil spirit from the body. Forty seconds, and the game is over: The patient has already joined the ranks of former smokers.",
  "last_phrase": "If you're struggling to quit smoking, magnetic hypnosis with the help of a skilled practitioner like Advocate Campanelli might be worth considering. In just 40 seconds, he can help you join the ranks of former smokers, by using pressure and gestures to chase the smoking habit from your mind and body. Combine this with your own willpower to make a strong double force against smoking."
