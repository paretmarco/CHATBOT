  "title": "What is the True Secret Behind the \"Magical\" Phenomena of Dupotet: Suggestion or an Unknown Force?",
  "first_phrase": "This final section examines the mysterious and sometimes inexplicable nature of hypnotic phenomena through the work of French hypnotist, Dupotet. Dupotet's experiments showed that some physical objects acted as powerful \"energetic anchors,\" influencing a subject's behavior. He was able to remove the effects of drunkenness by taking away the subject's cane and included the transformation of youthful subjects into the elderly. While some of these effects seem attributable to suggestion, some suggest the involvement of an extraneous force. This force is not fully understood and lies beyond the present scope but is worth considering given the experiences of other magnetisers like Cahaghnet and others.",
  "content": "For instance, when a hypnotist gives a ring to a subject, and tells him that whenever he turns it round on his finger three times he will go to sleep, Suggestion would be an entirely satisfactory explanation of this \"magical\" phenomenon, were it not that it is known to those who have investigated hypnotic phenomena more deeply than our modern hypnotists do, that there is an obscure class of phenomena which seem to imply the existence of some extraneous force or influence, the nature and extent of which are now unknown. The experiences of the magnetiser Cahaghnet, and the experiments of Colonel de Rochas, Dr. Baraduc, and others are cases in point; but as they deal with matters that lie in great part beyond my present field, I can do no more than suggest that some of Dupotet's \"magical\" work may possibly have involved that unknown but apparently very real force or influence. I allude to the experiments which Dupotet describes in his \"Magie Devoilee.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the unknown force or influence that seems to be present in hypnotic phenomena may provide a possible explanation for some of the \"magical\" work done by Dupotet and others in the field of magnetism. As such, further experimental study is necessary to better understand the nature and potential of this force, and how it may be harnessed through the power of the human soul."
