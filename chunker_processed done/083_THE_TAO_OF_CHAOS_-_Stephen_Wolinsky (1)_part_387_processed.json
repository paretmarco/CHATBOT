  "title": "\"The Importance of Organizing Perception and Movement\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text elaborates on the difficulties faced by both Virgil and the author in perceiving their surroundings due to a lack of organization in either their visual or auditory senses. As described by Sacks, Virgil struggled to distinguish between objects and recognize spatial relationships after surgery left him with partial vision. The author draws a parallel to their own experiences struggling to understand spoken French despite having studied the language. Interestingly, French lacks the emphasis on syllables present in English, making it more difficult to distinguish between words.",
  "content": "It is, I believe, impossible to see in a functional way, i.e., to perceive objects and space, without organizing one's movements and that perception and movement ability arise simultaneously. In any case without the ability of the nervous system to create such organization, one is faced with again, chaos. I tried to imagine what it was to be in Virgil's situation, and I found a parallel in my first experiences in France. Although I had studied French in school, and I had some vocabulary and could read and understand many words and sentences, I could understand nothing when I heard French spoken. Worse, I could not hear separate words; I could not tell where one word ended and another began. I also could not detect sound differences such as the difference between dessous and dessus, a simple task for a native speaker. Nor could I produce those sound differences in pronouncing the two words. When I began to be able to hear a little, I would find myself beginning to strain and then lose it again. I discovered that French, unlike English, is spoken without any emphasis on given syllables.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our ability to perceive objects and space is intimately connected with our ability to organize movements, and this organization arises simultaneously with perception. Our experience of the world is not given to us initially; rather, we must learn to organize our abilities to perceive and interact with it. This understanding reinforces the importance of continuous learning and adaptation throughout life."
