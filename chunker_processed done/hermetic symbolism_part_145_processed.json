  "title": "\"The Great Work: Understanding the Philosophical Fire and the Transformation into the Phoenix\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, it was explained how the Great Work involves both the interior and exterior fire, which when combined, forms the philosophical fire. This fire is sustained by the red Sulphur of the Sages, which manifests through the Phoenix, symbolizing individual fixedness and immutability acquired by the adept. In this last part of the text, it is explained that the need for perseverance is crucial in the process known as \"working on the metals.\" The resolve is necessary before the composition of Mercury, which acts upon the seven metals symbolizing earthly affections. Aspiring companions must transform themselves into the Phoenix to achieve success; otherwise, they will remain mediocre workers who lack the metal of the wise.",
  "content": "Furthermore, from the Initiatic viewpoint it symbolises, more specifically, the immutability acquired by the adept, whose individual initiative works in perfect harmony with the propulsion that every worker receives from the regulatory power of universal construction – in other words, the great Architect of the Universe. For the Companion whose ambition is to know how to work, his mission is to transform into the Phoenix. If he does not manage it, he will never be anything more than a mediocre worker, and for precisely that reason it would be said of him that: “he is no Phoenix”. We note also as what has been said now could be called “working on the metals”: The need for an assiduous and tenacious perseverance has been symbolized by the alchemists with the expression \"Iron of the Wise.\" This resolve is necessary in the operation before the composition of Mercury, which will later be made to act upon the (seven) metals that symbolize the earthly affections.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, for those who aspire to be more than just mediocre workers, the transformation into a Phoenix symbolizes the immutability acquired by the adept. This transformation requires assiduous perseverance and a balance between activity and passivity. The Initiate, in working with intelligence illuminated by understanding, assimilates himself with Gnosis. The Companion must take ownership of the theory of the two columns, while the Apprentice focuses on the relevant column. Remember, the right combination of activity and passivity is crucial for every fertile action."
