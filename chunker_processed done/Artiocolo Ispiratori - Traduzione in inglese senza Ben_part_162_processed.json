  "title": "\"Unlocking Presence: The Key to Man's Evolution\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a continuation of a discussion about magnetism and energetic healing. It includes the experience of Jean Pierre de Giudicelli's encounter with a powerful magnetist named Pastor, who taught him the essential keys of his method. One of the exercises recommended by Pastor was based on breathing and the development of enthusiasm and energy. The text also mentions the use of exercises of Egyptian origin that lead to reawakening the kundalini. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli has explored other traditions, such as Bon and Egyptian, to attain higher states of presence. The overall focus is on the recognition that presence represents the absolute key, and the books \"The Mystery of Time\" and \"Magnetism and the Energetic Ascent\" draw parallels between modern quantum technology and millenary teachings, including eastern teachings.",
  "content": "Naturally, magnetic healing is only deemed by a person intent on pursuing the path of presence to represent one stage of the overall itinerary. There is indeed a higher level. In this connection, Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli has also explored other traditions, such as Bon, from Tibet, and the Egyptian one, for the sake of attaining higher states of presence. When he was invited to our school, the Count held there a number of seminars more than once, and then exhorted us to go ahead with them and run them on our own, seeing that he is actually more concerned with the last phase of development than with teaching as such. The more one progresses, the more he is alive to the recognition that presence represents the absolute key, which we allude to in our books “The Mystery of Time” and (even more so) “Magnetism and the Energetic Ascent”. In these books we draw also a parallel between modern quantum technology and these millenary teachings. We do also comparison with eastern teachings.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while magnetic healing may be one stage of the journey towards attaining higher states of presence and consciousness, there is a higher level that can be achieved through exploring other traditions and methodologies. Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli has delved into such traditions and emphasized the importance of presence as the absolute key to evolution. To learn practical techniques for achieving presence in the action and experiencing inward changes, it is recommended to attend a seminar held in a natural environment."
