  "title": "\"Understanding the Modes of Procedure in Mesmerism and Hypnotism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author warned about the danger of striving for certain phenomena in mesmerism without understanding the innate faculties of the sensitive. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the Modes of Procedure used by various operators - including hypnotists - in successful operations. The founder of the Hypnotists, Dr. Braid's views are briefly mentioned and credited for acknowledging the sensitivity of individuals. The author also emphasizes the importance of bringing scientific watchfulness and calmness to all operations.",
  "content": "Next are the Hypnotists, an important class, of whom Dr. Braid, of Manchester, was the founder. There is much to be said in favour of his views. A full explanation of them would be too tedious and technical for a work of this wind. To his credit, it must be said, he was the first who did justice to the individuality or personal powers of the sensitive.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Braid's contributions to the field of hypnosis were significant, as he was the first to recognize the importance of the individuality and personal powers of the sensitive individual. Despite some of his views being considered too technical, his explanation of the phenomena has paved the way for further developments in the field. It is important to note, however, that mesmerists were still able to achieve greater results than Braid, and the psychological school he founded differs in scope and effects from the classical magnetic school."
