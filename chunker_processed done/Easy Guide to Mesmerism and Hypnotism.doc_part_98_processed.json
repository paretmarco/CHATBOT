  "title": "\"Hypnotists and Their Founders: Braid, Heidenhain, and Carpenter\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this insightful text, the author discusses the contributions of Dr. Braid, the founder of the important class of Hypnotists. The previous section of the text provides an understanding of the history of hypnotism and mesmerism, and their effects on individuals. Dr. Braid's views, which emphasize the importance of individuality and personal powers of the sensitive, are discussed in detail. He believed that hypnosis could be induced by a fixed state, repetition, and absolute repose of the body, without the need for mesmeric or magnetic influence. However, the editor's note suggests that Mr. Braid's views were inferior to those of mesmerists, and the psychological school, which derived from the classical magnetic school, was different in scope and effect.",
  "content": "He reproduced many of the effects induced by mesmerists without, what he denied, mesmeric influence, or the influence of a second person, and accounted for the phenomena by supposing that there is “a derangement of the cerebro-spinal centres and of circulating and respirating and muscular systems, induced by a fixed state, absolute repose of body fixed attention and suppressed respiration, concurrent with fixity of attention.” Also he expressed his opinion “that the whole depended on the physical and psychical condition of the patient, arising from the causes referred to, and not at all on the volition or passes of the operator throwing out a magnetic fluid or exciting into activity some mystical universal fluid or medium.” Had Mr. Braid been living now he would have been surprised to see how his ideas have been developed in certain quarters, and that with very chary acknowledgment to himself. Editor's note: The facts realized by Braid are nonetheless inferior to what was realized by mesmerists, and this by his own admission (see next chapter). The psychological school (here at the beginning) even if derived from the classical magnetic school, is different from its scopes and effects.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Braid's theories and methods were influential in the development of hypnotism, they differed from those of mesmerists and were not as effective. However, the ideas of Braid, Heidenhain, and Carpenter have continued to influence contemporary hypnotism practices, which vary depending on the individual operator's techniques. It is important to recognize the evolution and varying approaches within the field of hypnotism."
