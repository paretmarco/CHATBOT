  "title": "\"Magnetism Techniques for Pain Relief and Relaxation\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the practice of magnetism and its effects. The writer explains two methods of magnetization and suggests that a successful magnetic pass draws out pain from the subject. The last 200 tokens provide principles for the proper employment of various magnetism processes. They also mention Deleuze, who produced somnambulism without touching. This part of the text serves as a guide for those interested in learning about magnetization and understanding how magnetism can be applied to alleviate pain.",
  "content": "When the communication is established, one can magnetize very well by placing himself at the foot of the patient's bed, and in front of him ; then directing at that distance both hands from the head to the feet, dashing them aside after each pass so as not to conduct the fluid to himself. Deleuze sometimes produced somnambulism by this process, without establishing the communication by touching. Further proceedings This is what I have to say about magnetism by the long pass, with which it is always proper to commence, and to which a person may confine himself until he has a reason for employing other processes. Let us now consider the circumstances which point out particular processes. When any one has a local pain, it is natural, after establishing a communication, to carry the magnetic action to the suffering part. It is not by passing the hands over the arms that we undertake to cure a sciatic ; it is not by putting the hand upon the stomach that we can dissipate a pain in the knee. Here are some principles to guide us. The magnetic pass, if well done, draws along with it the pain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism by the long pass is an effective method for establishing communication and can be used to draw pain away from a specific area if done correctly. When dealing with localized pain, it is essential to target the affected area directly, using the principles of magnetic passes to dissipate the pain gradually. With patience and persistence, this method can be a useful tool for managing pain and promoting overall well-being."
