  "title": "What were the Barberinists and how did their beliefs in animal magnetism lead to spiritualism and clairvoyance?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we learned about the development of the Barberinist school of animal magnetism by De Barberin and Saint Martin. Patients were often thrown into trances, followed by visions of the spiritual world. In this last part of the text, we learn about M. Cahagnet, a man who discovered his ability to induce the magnetic sleep in others and subsequently used this power to biologize his subjects and effect cures of disease. However, he soon realizes that he had built wiser than he knew.",
  "content": "He affirms that he was a ‘materialist’ when first his attention was attracted to the subject of animal magnetism, but being of a thoughtful nature, he determined to devote all the leisure he could spare to a thorough examination of its possibilities. When he found that he possessed the power to induce the magnetic sleep in others, he proceeded on the plan then generally adopted by mesmerists, namely, to try how far he could succeed in biologizing his subjects, that is to say, to substitute his own senses, mind, and will, for those of the sleeper. In the course of these experiments M. Cahagnet discovered that he could effect remarkable cures of disease, and being naturally of a benevolent disposition, he determined to bend all his energies in this desirable direction. He soon found, however, that he was destined to realize the aphorism, “ he built wiser than he knew.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, what started as a simple examination of animal magnetism for M. Cahagnet, turned into a journey of discovery. From his initial skepticism to curing diseases and communicating with the souls of the dead, he learned that sometimes, our best intentions lead us to unexpected and wondrous places. So, let us always keep an open mind, for the possibilities are vast and extraordinary."
