  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the text explores the concept of the self and its continuity after death. It suggests that the self is not a fixed entity, but rather a constantly changing one, influenced by various factors such as memories, aspirations, and ancestral heritage. It also delves into the idea of immortality, arguing that true immortality lies in being part of the greater universal life rather than in individual or personal immortality. The text encourages readers to become more than just their narrow personalities and to embrace the greater humanity. The text concludes by introducing the symbol of the point in the center of a circle to represent the self and making a connection to alchemical symbols.",
  "content": "The ego may vary with the degree of suggestion that receives . Under these conditions our personality seems an automaton. We are not only the need to play our part on the puppet theater of the world, but we are live puppets and life is ONE . This unit of life can make us immortal , making us part of the immortality of the Great Whole , which is the only effective , because a mean immortality narrow, individual or personal , is repugnant to any sound reason . The individual is an ephemeral and particularized manifestation of the species , which permit us to see him as part of a more extense life linked to the great universal life.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by acknowledging our interconnectedness with the universal life and disregarding the limitations of our ego, we can elevate our humanity and achieve a superior and durable existence. Occult Medicine serves as a reminder of the hidden aspects of our being that are beyond the grasp of official science, and its principles provide a path for those willing to explore the secrets of nature."
