  "title": "Creating Alteration in Sensory Perceptions - The \"Big Face\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we have explored how alterations in sensory perceptions can happen and how distance plays a crucial role in it. Now, we will delve deeper into two specific phenomena: the \"Big Face\" illusion and Diploplia. The former is the apparent enlarging of an object, like a face, when the eye accommodates to a closer distance. The latter is a double image perception that occurs when there is a discrepancy between the two eyes' images. We will explain these concepts in detail and their relevance to vision and perception.",
  "content": "In fact judgments of apparent size are highly correlated with visual accommodation distance, and in aviation it has been proved that the difficulty of detecting airplanes on stationary collision courses is greatly aggravated when focus is trapped by structure close to the eyes. While alteration in sensory perceptions has something in common with the jargon of ericksonian hypnosis all other phenomena that don't pertain to ericksonian hypnosis and are strictly physiological Diploplia Though physiological diploplia is seldom noticed in everyday life, it is readily perceived when attention is drawn to it. For example, if a pencil is held vertically a short distance in front of the eyes while a more distant object is steadily fixated, the pencil will be seen in crossed diploplia. Hence the rule: uncrossed diploplia occurs when the object is farther than fixation, crossed diploplia when it is nearer than fixation In general, the diplopic images are out of focus and insubtantial.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, physiological diplopia may not be noticeable in everyday life, but it can greatly impact our visual perceptions. The correlation between apparent size and visual accommodation distance underscores the importance of maintaining proper focus, especially in high-pressure situations like aviation. By understanding these phenomena and how they affect us, we can better navigate the world around us and minimize our risk of accidents."
