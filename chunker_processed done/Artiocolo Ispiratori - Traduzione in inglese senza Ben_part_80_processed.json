  "title": "\"The Mysterious Technique of Smoking De-conditioning\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the enigmatic techniques of Herman Michel, a Swiss man who claims to have the ability to cure people of smoking habits in just one minute. In the previous paragraphs, the author describes how Michel uses subtle techniques to alter patients' perceptions of smoking, creating a mysterious 'inhibition to smoking.' In the last 200 tokens, we witness a lady from Rome succumbing to Michel's techniques, throwing away her last packet of cigarettes. The text ends with Michel smiling and refusing to reveal the secret behind his successful treatment, leaving readers to speculate on the workings of his peculiar methodology.",
  "content": "Thereupon, the said lady heads for the dustbin and throws inside it what might well have been the last cigarettes she had bought in her life. Scattered around the tall conifers in the garden, the patients relate their personal impressions to one another. No one is of course smoking. When he is questioned as to the exact way his treatment operates, or how he came to learn the technique, or whether it is not in fact the product of a mysterious fluid, he answers back with a smile midway between entertained and disappointed. – I am sorry, but I cannot confide it – is his reply. If he is faced with a persistent such questioner, he dishes out elusive answers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Herman Michel's peculiar psychosomatic technique for smoking cessation is based on an induced hypnosis that conditions the hypothetical nerve center of smoking in the brain. Suggestion also plays a significant role in his treatment, and the feeling of trust he inspires in his patients is essential. Professor Uva emphasizes the importance of immediate trust between healer and patient. Thus, trust, hypnosis, and conditioning form the core of Michel's treatment."
