  "content": "13. Experience the growing inner emptiness inside your body as your Essence or Real Self 14. Know that although you experience your inner emptiness as separate from everyone else's inner emptinessâ€”THERE IS ONLY ONE EMPTINESS. 15. Know that your inner emptiness is a passage to the great . void of the underlying unity which is Quantum Consciousness. / C ompassion has been held in high esteem for years both in psychological as well as spiritual disciplines. Compassion can be seen as an empathic understanding of another's plight. Compassion is not pejorative. It is not an intellectual process; nor is it a created response. All too often, compassion becomes \"looking compassionate,\" \"saying compassionate things,\" or \"a supportive hug of understanding.\" This is not compassion, but one person's idea of what compassion looks like, acts like, or sounds like. Compassion is a feeling sense that takes place in the body that brings forth a sense of humanity and connection. I notice, for example, when I \"feel compassion,\" it is a present-time body sense, a felt presence, a relationship in present time of being to being that feels connected.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embodying your body is a crucial step towards feeling compassion, which is not merely a show of support or empathy, but a deep and present feeling that connects you to others, regardless of their inner emptiness. Therefore, focus on your body and experience the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness."
