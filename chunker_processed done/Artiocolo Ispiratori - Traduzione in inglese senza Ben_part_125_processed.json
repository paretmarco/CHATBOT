  "title": "\"The Instant Healing Techniques of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text presents the remarkable abilities of Prof. Erminio di Pisa, who has developed powerful techniques to remove various pains and solve a range of problems, including addiction, hypertension, and sexual dysfunctions. Doctors also regularly visit him as clients. Prof. Muzzana, a psychiatrist, praises his exceptional success rate, authority, and efficacy, making him stand out among speakers on hypnosis. In this last part, the text emphasizes Erminio's pursuit of harmonizing his nature with his subjects, presenting him as a catalyst of a direct, effective, and natural approach to curing patients.",
  "content": "His certainty, combined with technique, bestows on him an irresistible blend of authority and efficacy which, along with experience, is able to perfect the inborn and extraordinary talents he is undoubtedly singled out by. While the hypnotized person is waiting for something, the phenomenon unfolds itself instantly. Heartfelt thanks are owed therefore to Erminio for being the catalyst of a return to a type of hypnosis which speaks directly to the recesses of our nervous system, through its recorded instructions which shall, post-hypnotically, be honoured for sure. Let us not forget that, as the Chinese version of Taoism contends, five out of ten sick persons are cured by doing nothing, simply by restoring balance in their own organism. A doctor who cures six or seven patients is one who displays an abundant command of his art. Erminio goes further, by seeking to harmonize his nature with his individual subjects!‚Äù Prof. Erminio di Pisa was wont to assiduously cure dozens of people on a weekly basis, within his study, as part of his regular professional activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Erminio di Pisa's revolutionary hypnosis techniques have proven to be highly effective in curing a wide array of physical conditions, with a remarkable success rate of 97%. His emphasis on instant healing and harmonizing with individual subjects has brought relief to many patients. His recorded instructions hold promise for continued efficacy in post-hypnotic states. Overall, his legacy reminds us that sometimes, doing nothing can be the key to achieving balance and restoring health."
