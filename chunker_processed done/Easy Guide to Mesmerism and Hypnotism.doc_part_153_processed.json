  "title": "\"Ways to Cultivate Clairvoyance through Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the topic of cultivating clairvoyance or clear sight through Mesmerism. Before delving into the details of how the phenomenon can be induced, the author first describes a simple technique that involves blowing air on the forehead to awaken a sensitive patient. The author then goes on to explain that hypnotic and platform subjects cannot become clairvoyants, and that the only way to cultivate clairvoyance is through the process of Mesmerism. The author asserts that clairvoyance is a reality, and that it has been repeatedly testified to by credible witnesses. The text also covers the concept of rapport or sympathy, which is essential to establish a connection between the Mesmeriser and the patient. The author highlights that clairvoyance can be induced by Mesmerism and reveals that the mesmeriser and the sensitive are distinct individuals with their own unique characteristics.",
  "content": "Introvision or prevision, have been and are phenomena so common in the experience of mesmerists of the old school, and so amply recorded, that I need but briefly refer to them here. The mesmeriser recognises that in order to act: upon a patient, there must be a connecting link of sympathy between them. This connecting link is not a creation of suggestion and ignorance by which the phantasies and illusions of hypnotic patients are created, but a real link by which (moral, mental, and. physical) sympathy is thoroughly established between the mesmeriser on the one hand and his sensitive on the other. By concentration of the will and the use of the means, the rapport or sympathy desired, between the operator and the patient is effected the honest desire to relieve pain and cure disease then finds a ready channel of communication. If in some instances the action for good is Intensified by faith in the patient, it is only natural it-should be so. That clairvoyance can be induced by Mesmerism is not be doubted. The mesmeriser and his sensitive axe distinct entities, egos—individuals, if you will —both- having their respective organisation, temperament, and character.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism relies on establishing a genuine connection of sympathy between the operator and the patient, allowing for effective communication and healing. While clairvoyance can be induced through Mesmerism, it is only possible because of the spiritual and mental connection established between the mesmeriser and the sensitive. By understanding the true nature of Mesmerism, one can unlock its highest potential for the good of both the operator and the patient."
