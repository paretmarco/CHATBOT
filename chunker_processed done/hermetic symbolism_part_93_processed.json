  "title": "\"The Art of Magnetism: Healing with Fluidic Force\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text deals with the concept of magnetic healing and how to effectively administer it to someone. The first part of the text emphasizes the need to pacify and direct the opposing forces within ourselves before extending one's hand towards the patient. The text goes on to explain how an expert magnetizer can diagnose an illness and balance the energy in a sick body. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the characteristics of a magnetizer in the second part who creates a harmonious balance with the sick person and observes the spontaneous effects of the forces in action. The maximum force for a magnetizer is a strong will accompanied by calmness.",
  "content": "The magnetizer can let himself overexcite by the healing action, mostly at the end.” Hermetically speaking, “this second part is characterized by a sort of neutrality of the magnetizer, that profits from the harmonic balance created between him and the sick person, to observe the spontaneous effects of the forces that he put in action. At this moment we have a real hyperestesia in the touch, that permit him to discover the intentions that Nature itself manifests. In this way, when the magnetizer has an idea, he enters in the last phase, and becomes active. At this point he must stay with his intention on the result he want to get. The maximum of force for a magnetizer is a strong will accompanied by calmness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the magnetizer must maintain a strong will accompanied by calmness and a strong imagination to act as a tool of nature for the spontaneous effects of the forces he puts in action. The Hermetic theories of Alchemists emphasize the importance of the single first principle of Light, which forms Air and Water, essential foundations of all substances inorganic and organic."
