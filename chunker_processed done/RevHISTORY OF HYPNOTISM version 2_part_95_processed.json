In fact, every symptom which is kept alive for a sufficiently long time is prone to ‘entrenching itself’ in the body. An interiorized emotion might generate pathologies, even of a serious nature. By resorting to magnetism, a solution is found for the pathological condition in a somatic way, by acting on those points where the emotion/energy identifies itself. In magnetism, one accordingly starts from the premise of a natural idea of healthiness and well-being, whereupon those two conditions are restored and can often get results almost instantly. The person will normally feel the body rebalancing itself and the energies find their natural way.
