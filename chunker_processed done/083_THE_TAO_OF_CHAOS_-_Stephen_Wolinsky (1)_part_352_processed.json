  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the intricacies of identity and knowledge with several key concepts we need to understand. In this final part of \"The Tao of Chaos,\" we explore the relationship between attention and the Knower-I-Identity Unit. The Knower exchange attention with thoughts, emotions, memories, and objects, which acts as a glue. To move beyond this unit, we must acknowledge and experience the a-tension between them. The Tao of Chaos exercises 72 and 73 guide us through this process with simple, step-by-step instructions.",

Therefore to move beyond this Knower/I-dentity unit, the a-tension between them must be experienced and acknowledged. Tao of Chaos Exercise #72 Inner World Step INotice a thought.
