  "title": "\"The Dangers and Use of Mesmerism According to Esdaile\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the dangers of Mesmerism, specifically focusing on the perspective of Esdaile, a medical man who believed that Mesmerism was safe as long as it was only used for medical purposes. However, he did acknowledge the potential dangers of shock and \"mesmeric disease\". In the last 200 words, the text delves into how Esdaile used \"gazing\" to achieve a mesmeric effect and his experiments to determine the best distance for this technique.",
  "content": "The thought fills them with horror, and with a fearful cry, they bury their faces in their hands, like persons struck blind by lightning; but this soon passes off, and the retina recovers its sensibility by a little rubbing of the eye.\" The danger here lies in the shock to the patient, which Esdaile considered the real inconvenience of this accident, and mesmerised subjects are liable to shock in other ways. The danger of shock, together with that of the â€œmesmeric disease\" or falling spontaneously into the mesmeric state, are the only dangers which he seems to have recognised. How Esdaile used gaze Although Esdaile used \"gazing\" finding it to have a powerful mesmeric effect, this was neither the \"fascination\" of the modern hypnotist, nor the \"fixing\" of the eye of other mesmerists, for the subject did not return his gaze. He tried a great many experiments to find out at what distance the passes and gazing would affect his subjects.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Esdaile found gazing to have a powerful effect, it was not the modern hypnotist's fascination or other mesmerists' fixation. Gazing did not require the subject to return the gaze. Although there are risks involved in mesmerism, Esdaile believed that it was incontestably proven that mesmeric fluid can transmit through a large body of air, thus necessitating caution and further study."
