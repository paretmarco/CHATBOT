  "title": "The Unity of Mind and Body: Exploring Somatic Organizations and Awareness",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we've explored the tension between idealism and realism in regards to the relationship between our minds and the perceived external world. Now, we'll delve into the idea that the mind and body are not separate entities but a single unity referred to as the soma. By recognizing the interrelatedness of mental and motor functions, we may cultivate mindfulness and explore new pathways for living embodied in the processes of the system. This concept is central to both the Feldenkrais method and Quantum Psychology, each emphasizing somatic awareness in their practice.",
  "content": "We can feel in ourselves changes in our breathing, our state of tension as we shift feeling states. From this perspective we must contend that what we call mind and body are not two entities related to each other, but a single unity. Let us use the word, soma, to refer to this unity. This fits well with the ideas of Maturana and Varela where organization is embodied in the processes of the system. Given that our systems are fundamentally self referential, that we thereby have the ability to self observe, and through language communicate to ourselves about it, we must open to the possibility of mindfulness as a pathway to knowledge about ourselves. We can explore and separate from the very structures we create for living our lives and find pathways to new patterns and options that give us the flexibility for life for which we are already capable. This is the project of Quantum Psychology as developed by Stephen Wolinsky as well as the Feldenkrais work. Feldenkrais work emphasizes awareness as it is experienced in movement, Quantum Psychology the awareness of the processes as experienced in the psyche. Each work is implicitly and explicitly somatic in its basic thought.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, understanding the unity of mind and body as a single entity called soma can lead us to explore new patterns and options for a more flexible life. Through mindfulness and awareness, as emphasized in both Feldenkrais work and Quantum Psychology, we can observe and differentiate the structures we create for living and find ways to separate from them. With this knowledge, we can create more stable and ordered structures in our interactions with the world for a better functioning life."
