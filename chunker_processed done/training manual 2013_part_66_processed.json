  "title": "\"The Power of Symbols in Society\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discussed how symbols in primal societies become powerful and influence the everyday behaviour of their members. This idea also applies to modern societies, where symbols, such as advertising or status symbols, have a life of their own and are so strong that people are ready to die for them. In the last 200 tokens, we will talk about the third rule of magnetism, which suggests that we should think of forces as something external and feel the force of our gestures and movements, making them feel sacred. Deleuze's notion of belief being necessary to induce one to make a firm and steady use of their faculties is also discussed.",
  "content": "The symbol becomes powerful through the acts of the participants in such gathering. Also in our society symbols are elements of force, as we can see from advertising. Each time we see something, there is a double dimension in it: firstly the physical an after the various levels of the psychological dimension. Also our modern society is ruled by elements that we call \"status symbols\", \"principles\", that have a life of their own and that are so strong that people is ready to die for them. We have therefore a double way: from us to the object in perceiving it, and from the object to us. THIRD RULE IN MAGNETISM: think to forces as something external and feel the force of your gestures and movements. Feel as you were doing something sacred As Deleuze said: if the will is necessary to direct the fluid, belief is necessary to induce one to make a firm and steady use of the faculties he possesses. Confidence in the power we possess makes us act without effort and without distraction.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, symbols hold immense power in our society, and our actions as participants can further amplify their influence. Our modern society is heavily influenced by status symbols and principles, while our belief in the power we possess can lead to confident and effortless action. Understanding the universal life force that permeates the universe can serve as the basis for harnessing our physical and mental energy. Remember, external forces interact with our own, so we must feel the force of our gestures and movements as if we were doing something sacred."
