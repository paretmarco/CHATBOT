  "title": "How does the will of the hypnotist affect suggestibility in hypnotherapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we explore how the intention of the hypnotist operates in persuading the subject to make a magnetic promise. Teste, a French magnetiser, believed that \"knowing how to impress his will opportunely\" was fundamental to the art of magnetising. He proved this with two instances, where he wished his subject to remember specific information or improve their language skills. In both instances, the subject retained the information without the will of the hypnotist. This last 200 tokens presents Teste's work as evidence of the power of suggestion without the hypnotist's will.",
  "content": "Teste mentions another suggestive instance of the same phenomenon. He had a patient of German birth, who spoke French with a disagreeable accent. He thus describes what happened on one occasion:- ' \"One day, as he was after doling out to me a string of words, in which, as if from design, those very consonants which he bungled most disagreeably happened to be collected together, I exclaimed, no longer able to contain myself, ‘For goodness sake, M. Pradhier, speak French as it is spoken in Paris!’ My somnambulist stopped quite short, seemed absorbed a minute or two, then, on my invitation, resumed the thread of his story, but with a purity of accent that actually confounded me. I then asked him if it would not be possible for him to retain, on awakening, the happy fruits of the strange grammar lesson I had just given him, without, however, intending it. ‘Nothing more simple,' he said, ‘you have but to wish it.' ‘Well, then, I wish it: be it so.` \" Taste goes on to say that when Mons.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the phenomenon of suggestion, also known as hypnosis, has been studied and documented for centuries. The power of suggestion can lead to significant changes in a person's behavior or perception, as illustrated in the examples given. With further research and development, this technique could potentially have practical applications in fields such as medicine and psychology."
