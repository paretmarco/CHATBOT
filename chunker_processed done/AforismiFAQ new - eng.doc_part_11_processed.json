  "first_phrase": "In this article on Magnetism and Mesmerismus ©, we have explored the importance and density of non-verbal communication in contrast to verbal communication, and how recognizing this leads to a greater balance and connection with one's essential self. Dr. Paret has developed a specific method to help individuals understand and become in touch with their non-verbal being. This article highlights how Magnetism can amplify the effects of hypnosis and subliminally shift one's state for rapid and effective results. Let's dive deeper into how these techniques can uplift hypnosis.",
  "content": "Note how the body and the non verbal are also the basis for higher states as it was stated by the ancient hermetists: \"This body, a mere eight hands tall, comprises the world, is the creation of the world, the end of the world and the path that leads to the resolution of the world\" (Pernety) these words strongly complement the Tabula Smaragdina: \"That which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above, for the performance of the miracles of the one thing\" In which field is mesmerismus © particularly effective? Whenever hypnosis is resorted to, magnetism has the ability of amplifying its effect. What is different, however, is that the approach which mesmerismus © takes pays great regard to the body, and undoubtedly operates at a more subliminal level than classical hypnosis. As for the speed at which results materialize, results might be within closer reach due to the fact that the non-verbal is denser than the verbal, as the latter follows the speed of words. We strive always to provide the most simple, rapid and effective techniques in the world. How are these techniques able to uplift hypnosis?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerismus© can be particularly effective in the field of hypnosis by amplifying its effect at a subliminal level and providing simple, rapid, and effective techniques.
