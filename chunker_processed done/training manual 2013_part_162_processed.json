  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the importance of exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The fourth exercise is a technique that involves facing different directions at different times of the day and taking a standing position while swinging the arms in a circular motion, as directed. The exercise is done by inhaling gradually and gently, then clenching the fist and touching the floor with the knuckles of the fist before exhaling and throwing the arm backward. It is important to observe proper inhalations and exhalations as well as hold the breath while making the downward movement.",
  "content": "After you have swung the right arm around twelve times, bring arm up as though to make one more revolution, but stop when hand is above the head, clench the fist while taking a full breath, then by bending forward with hip movement, touch the floor in front of you with the knuckles of the fist, after which rise gradually, exhaling at the same time, and throw arm up into position with a backward circular movement. Go through the same procedure with left arm swinging the same twelve times in a circular motion then clench fist and touch the floor in front of you as you did with the right. Observe the proper inhalations and exhalations with perfect rhythm. Be particular to hold the breath while making the downward movement to touch the floor, and exhale when bringing the arm back to position. If you do not touch the floor at first, do not feel discouraged. Bend the body as far forward as you are able, but do not bend the knees. Remember, it is to be a hip movement entirely.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating this exercise routine into your daily life can lead to a more harmonious and healthy body and mind, aiding in reducing protruding abdomens and flabby cheeks, as well as developing perfect form and beauty in your bust, neck, face, arms, and chest. Remember to do this exercise after meals, and don't be discouraged if you are not able to touch the floor at first - it's all about the hip movement. Keep up the good work and strive for a more natural means towards a healthy life!"
