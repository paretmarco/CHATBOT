  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text elaborates on Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli's research and expertise in various fields. The Count, a representative of a French brotherhood and a member of its inner circle, emphasizes the importance of being present to achieve the best results. He possesses vast erudition and in-depth knowledge of literature, classics, and French traditions, as well as an interest in esotericism from a young age. He finds many people get lost in their thoughts, rather than focusing on the real thing. Count de Giudicelli's life is marked by rare anecdotes and a design towards reawakening. The preceding text explains the necessity to disengage oneself from one's thoughts to perceive reality directly, and F.A. Mesmer's similar experience.",
  "content": "It was precisely this individual who channelled my attention towards the importance of presence as one of the essential elements behind the accomplishment of the best results. He has an extremely vast erudition, and his book “De la Rose Rouge et de la Croix d’Or” describes structures and organizations, the mere existence of which, before he cast off the veil from them, was hitherto unknown. In addition, he possesses a deep culture in the field of literature and the classics. He also see the strong tie existing within the concepts elaborated by modern quantum sciences and ideas existing from hundreds of years. He strives to adopt a pragmatic point of view and finds that to many people get lost in thoughts instead to look toward the real thing, that is very technical and at his core, very simple. Since a young age, he felt the urge to develop an interest in esotericism. His life is punctuated by many rare anecdotes, and is seemingly traversed by a design tending to proceed along the path of reawakening.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of \"Presence\" is essential to achieving the best results, according to the experienced and learned individual described in this text. With deep knowledge of esotericism, literature, and modern quantum sciences, he has gained a profound understanding of the importance of being present in all aspects of life. As seen in various traditions, the goal of achieving presence is not a new one, but rather a timeless pursuit for ultimate clarity, simplicity, and success."
