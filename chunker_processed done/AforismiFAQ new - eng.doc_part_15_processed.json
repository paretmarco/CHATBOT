  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between animal magnetism, energy work, and human sensibility. It discusses the use of animal magnetism in the context of the Law of Attraction and the difference between imagining energy versus feeling it. The author also touches on the concept of self and essential individuality, as well as the different frameworks present in Western and Eastern practices. In the last 200 tokens, the author considers the risks associated with magnetism and asks whether it is based on an empathic relationship. Overall, the text offers a thoughtful examination of the role of animal magnetism in human spirituality and self-understanding.",
  "content": "Let us also bear in mind, in this context, the concept to the effect that the self must give in to one's essential inward individuality (which is likewise animal per se). The ability to truly feel has been admirably articulated by Master Lao-Tse in his Tao Te King: “The masters of yore were free, clairvoyants, intuitive: Within the vast expanse of their spirit’s forces, the Self still lay unconscious: It was this unconsciousness of the interior force which conferred greatness on their appearance\". Also there is a different approach and framework in western practices and eastern practices. As in our school we present both, we know very well the differences and similitudes. I watched a video which showed a person acting as if he were an automat guided by some remote control It is indeed true that one can obtain extremely powerful results through the use of magnetism. Due, however, to the fact that, when we practice it, we establish contact with the foundational part of our own selves, no risks are incurred. Throughout the history of the discipline, there is no record attesting to the occurrence of negative cases. Is magnetism based on an emphatic relationship?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of magnetism in healing practices has been proven effective and safe throughout history. Whether approached through an empathic relationship or quantum correlation, the key principle is to guide attention through passes and movements. By establishing contact with one's foundational self, practitioners can obtain powerful results while avoiding any risks. As such, magnetic healing remains a viable option for those seeking to tap into their essential inward individuality."
