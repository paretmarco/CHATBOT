  "title": "\"Magnetism and Healing: Puysegur's Success with Distance Influence\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section delves into the history of mesmerism and explores the concept of magnetic influence from a distance, which often yields successful results on unprepared subjects. The author mentions Puysegur, who managed to induce a stable state through magnetism, leading to remarkable healing experiences. Additionally, we learn about the marquis, who resorted to magnetizing a tree to minister to an increasing number of patients. The patients were seated around the tree, connected to its branches with cords to form a chain in what can only be described as a fascinating experiment.",
  "content": "The news of his cure was rapidly spread abroad, and from all sides there was a concourse of sick people demanding relief. The phenomena were repeated, to Puysegur's great joy, and he wrote: \"My head is turned with joy, now that I see what good I am doing.\" What we learn from Puysegur: with magnetism it is possible to induce a stable state. In this state healing can occur. Similar states of stability can also come about when working with magnetism on animals. They are more stable on the ground, and they let themselves go after few passes. Since he was unable to minister to the continually increasing number of patients, the marquis pursued Mesmer's plan of magnetizing an elm which grew on the village green at Buzancy. The patients were seated on stone benches round this tree, with cords connecting its branches with the affected parts of their bodies, and they formed a chain by linking their thumbs together.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's work highlights the potential of magnetism to induce stable states that promote healing in both humans and animals. He also emphasized the importance of paying attention to nature and the role of air in the magnetic process. Furthermore, focusing on one's breath is fundamental, even for the operator."
