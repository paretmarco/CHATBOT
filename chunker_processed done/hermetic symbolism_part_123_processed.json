  "title": "\"The Strictly Normal Individual: A Study on Hermetic Philosophy and Freemasonry\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the importance of striking a balance in one's character, avoiding exaggeration in either direction. They also mentioned the existence of seven ideal types of individuals, with the perfectly balanced Adamic Model of Man being the seventh. Now, in the final part, the author references a book by Wilhelm Höhler, which ties Freemasonry to the tradition of hermetic philosophy and alchemy. This section explores the relatedness of freemasonry to alchemy and the hermetic philosophy. The central I is overwhelmed by tenderness, goodwill, and affection.",
  "content": "Let us not exaggerate the importance of the graphical character determinations that we have just sketched out. Other interpretations could be drawn from them, because nothing is absolute in this area. Nevertheless, constructions of this type are advantageous in that they help the mind to discover certain analogies, and sometimes allow a healer to get to the root of certain morbid imbalances. In this era of psychoanalysis, these evocative figures are not to be trivialised. But all the logical deductions that can be made from a conventional ideograph cannot compare in importance to the classic planetary types. We will not embark now on the task of examining this septenary, which relates more specifically to Astrological Symbolism, but will dedicate a separate piece especially to the topic, that will follow on from Hermetic Symbolism. Hermetism and Freemasonry As a continuation of our study of the alchemical painting from the church of Saint Maurice of Reims, we would like to make a timely reference to a German book whose author, Wilhelm Höhler, attempts to demonstrate that freemasonry is closely related to alchemy, or more precisely, to hermetic philosophy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while graphical character determinations and alchemy may not hold absolute importance in today's era of psychoanalysis, they can still aid in the discovery of analogies and root causes of certain imbalances. Additionally, the relationship between Freemasonry and alchemy, explored in Wilhelm Höhler's book, can offer further insight into the hermetic philosophy. Further study of astrology, theosophy, magic, Kabbala, and alchemy may provide valuable knowledge and understanding."
