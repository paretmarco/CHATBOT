  "title": "\"The Art of Magnetic Gaze and Touch Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous 5 sections of this text, we learned about magnetizing or mesmerizing someone by making direct eye contact or asking them to look at a light, sitting in a certain position, and holding hands until calorific equilibrium is reached. In the last 200 tokens, the author describes how to proceed with the treatment by taking the patient's thumbs between their two fingers and gazing into their eyes until warmth is established. The concept of mental emptiness is crucial to the effectiveness of this method, and self-collectedness is required.",
  "content": "During this interval, it is scarcely necessary to state that thought is busy, and that the will impresses its action on the vital fluid, which is transmitted by the operator, his fingers serving, for this purpose, as conductors while moving along the patient's arms. 4. Have your patient sit down in the easiest position; seat yourself before him if possible, in a seat which is a little more elevated, so that his knees may be between yours and your feet beside his. Ask him to be in an easy and passive state. 5. After having brought yourself into a state of self-collectedness, take his thumbs between your two fingers, so that the inside of your thumbs may touch the inside of his; steadily fix your eyes upon him, and remain in this situation for a few minutes, until you perceive there is an equal degree of warmth between your thumbs and his.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this process of mesmerism, as described by Deleuze, requires patience and careful attention to detail. By following the steps and maintaining a state of self-collectedness, the practitioner can effectively transmit vital fluids and induce a state of relaxation in their patient."
