  "title": "Developing Presence: Magnetism and Communication on All Planes",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author emphasizes the importance of an individual finding their personal meaning in their actions and merging personality with universality. The last part shifts towards the development of a hypnotist's ability to communicate effectively, intuitively, and with sensitivity, using both rational and non-verbal perception. To achieve this goal, the hypnotist must strengthen their presence by developing awareness in spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical planes. These four levels can be associated with the neocortex, limbic system, and a superior spiritual plane. Mastering and becoming aware of emotions, vision, and other sensations can help achieve this goal. The text also refers to a \"man in the form of a cross\" and the concept of \"Presence\" for increasing magnetism.",
  "content": "To reach this goal it is important that the everyday left brain reasoning doesn't hurt this enhanced perception. In the ancient Egyptian tradition, \"presence\" is the key. Presence is also what permits the operator to stand vertically as an help and even an example to his client that otherwise would be absorbed by the problem of life. Awareness must be therefore developed on all planes, namely spiritual, mental, emotional, and the physical one, four levels that in a modern way of looking at the man we can make correspond to the neocortex (the mental plane), the lymbic system (the emotional plane), and a superior plane that we can think as both a synergy as well as something superior to the former three (the spiritual plane). Practically, to get to this goal we must master and become aware at all levels of the components of the perception of the outside world: emotions, vision, and the other sensations (touch, gravity, heat, pain, etc.) and hearing.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve presence and enhance perception, it is crucial to develop awareness on all planes - spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical. By mastering and becoming aware of the components of perception, we can access a new state of quintessence where problems of happiness and sadness vanish, allowing us to discover deep powers within ourselves. This new perspective is essential for accessing the true potential of magnetism and can positively transform our lives."
