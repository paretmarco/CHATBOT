  "title": "\"Deleuze's Magnetic Healing Procedure\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses Deleuze's mode of procedure, which involves a unique approach to healing a patient through magnetism. In the preceding tokens, the author details the exact steps Deleuze takes to establish a connection with the patient, and create an environment in which the patient is free from any constraint. These steps include having only one witness present, controlling the temperature, and instructing the patient to banish all fear and hopelessness. The author then delves into the physical techniques involved in the procedure, which include touching thumbs, fixating one's gaze on the patient, and making passes with one's hands.",
  "content": "After matters are well adjusted, take his thumbs between your two fingers, so that the interior of your thumb may touch the interior of his, and fix your eyes on him. You will remain from two to five minutes in this position, until you feel that an equal heat is established between his thumbs and yours. This being done, you will draw back your hands, separating them to the right and left and turning them so that the inner surface may be on the outside, and you will raise them a little higher than the head, then you will place them on the two shoulders, you will leave them there for about a minute, and you will bring them down the arms as far as the ends of the fingers, slightly touching them. You will recommence the pass five or six times turning away your hands and separating them a little from the body, so as to re-ascend.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this technique of \"the pass\" is used in mesmerism or hypnosis to induce a state of physical and mental relaxation. By following the steps, you can help establish an equal flow of energy between yourself and the person you're working on, which can promote healing and a sense of well-being. Remember to be patient and repeat the process as needed until you achieve your desired results."
