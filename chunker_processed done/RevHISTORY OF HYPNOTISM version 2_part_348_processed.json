  "title": "\"How does magnetic sleep and somnambulism occur during magnetic therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section discusses the process of magnetising a subject and the different states of consciousness that can be achieved. The magnetiser should use specific hand movements, while concentrating on the transmission of fluid to the subject. The state of magnetic sleep is recognised by the subject's impassive face and absence of swallowing. If in torpid sleep, the subject wakes up; if in magnetic sleep, the subject doesn't respond. If the subject reaches the state of somnambulism, they can hear and respond. It is crucial to awaken the subject at the end of the session.",
  "content": "\"The operator will recognise the magnetic sleep by the corpse-like impassivity of the subject's face, and the total absence of deglutition. \"After having operated in this way for a certain time, the magnetiser may ask the subject questions. If he is merely in a torpid state, or in natural sleep, he will wake up. In that case, the operation should cease, and the subject be strongly de-magnetised, for, although not put to sleep, the subject may have been so invaded by the fluid as not to be able to open his eyes. \"But if the subject is in the magnetic sleep, a deep sleep which no noise, and no sensation can bring him out of, he will not reply. If the magnetiser is not too tired, he should continue to magnetise him, in order to produce somnambulism, otherwise he should awaken him. \"But if the subject has passed through the magnetic sleep, and has arrived at the state of somnambulism, he will hear the magnetiser when he speaks to him, and can reply.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetic sleep and somnambulism are curious states of consciousness that can be carefully induced by an experienced magnetiser. However, it is crucial to know the signs of each state and how to properly awaken the subject. With proper training and practice, this technique may offer a new perspective on the human mind and consciousness."
