  "title": "\"Accessing Modern Mental Techniques: Recommended Reading List\"",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text describes the vast amount of information the authors have collected on modern mental techniques, mostly available in video format. However, due to the novelty of some practices, not all are available in written form or easy to understand for someone new to the subject. The authors recommend some essential books for an initial approach to Quantum Psychology, including works by Stephen H. Wolinsky, Bart Kosko, and Milton H. Erickson. In the following 200 tokens, we dive deeper into the subject, featuring the works of renowned figures such as Richard Bandler, Carl Jung, and Franz Bardon.",
