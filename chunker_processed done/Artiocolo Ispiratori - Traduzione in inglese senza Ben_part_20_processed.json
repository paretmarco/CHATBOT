  "title": "\"Polarities, Magnetism, and Animal Taming through Gaze\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking text, we explore the concept of polarities and how they may have a quantum interpretation. We see how observing a specific direction and intention can change reality and alleviate problems. The text also highlights the Durville brothers, whose work in French magnetism was admired by their contemporaries. The anecdote about Henri Durville showcases the power of magnetism as he successfully tames two aggressive beasts with only his gaze. The text concludes by encouraging readers to develop their own gaze to try something similar. The transformative power of our observations is truly remarkable.",
  "content": "In his self-confidence, armed with the sole weapon of his courage, the magnetist set out towards the pair of animals staging a mutiny against the owner and already on the verge of devouring him alive. While the members of the audience were holding their breath, the magnetist, in a motionless state, stared at them with a sparkling look, at the same time carrying out slow and sweet movements which fascinated them. After a few seconds, the two beasts calmed down while Durville kept executing his magnetic steps, without at any stage releasing them from the powerful clutch of his look brimful of will and energy. Under the potent impact of his steps, the lions quickly bent down and fell asleep. Even if the fact astounding, everyone having an animal can try very easily something similar. Firstly you must excerce your gaze. Put yourself in fron of a mirror in the way we describe in our online course you can find on www.mesmerismus.info. Look into your third eye without blinking. Try progressively to lengthen the period of observation.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing the techniques mentioned in the online course, anyone can develop their personal magnetism and become capable of taming animals with just their gaze. Start by exercising your gaze and gradually increasing the period of observation. With practice, you too can perform similar feats of mesmerism and gain control over animals like the magnetist did with the lions."
