  "title": "The Athanor and Magnetism: Ancient Traditions and Theories Explored.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the ancient tradition of the athanor and the concept of the three-tier symbol. Now, let's look at how these ideas are applied in magnetism and expanded states of consciousness. By bringing energy to the top of the head, or vertex, we can experience what is known as magnetic ecstasy. This point is connected to the pituitary gland and the thalamus, which is thought to play a key role in consciousness. Practicing this technique can lead to incredibly restoring and peaceful results. We'll also discuss the theories of de Puysegur, who simplified Mesmer's ideas and emphasized the importance of belief and will.",
  "content": "When we reproduce this state in our seminars people tell us it is incredibly restoring and peaceful. The theories of Puysegur As far as de Puysegur's theoretic views are concerned, there were some important modifications of those of Mesmer. \"It is concerning our sensations that Mesmer has come to enlighten us and his doctrine tends to lend support to all truths that until now, spoke only to the mind\" De Puysegur Less versed in physical science as his master, he always maintains the existence of an universal fluid, of which he recognizes the electric nature; but he simplifies the process: this fluid saturates all bodies, and especially the human body, which has a perfect electric organization, and is an animated electric machine. Man can display this electric fluid at pleasure, and diffuse it externally by his movements, in order to produce somnambulism. In any case de Puysegur was not very bothered with theory. He affirmed that the main point was “croyez et veuillez” which means “believe and will”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, de Puysegur's theories on magnetism led to the discovery of the peaceful and restorative state of somnambulism. By simplifying the process and emphasizing the power of belief and will, de Puysegur's experimental approach to magnetism led to more positive and effective results without the need for violent crisis."
