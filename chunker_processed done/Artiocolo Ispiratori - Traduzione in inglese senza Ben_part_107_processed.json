  "title": "\"The Last Fascinator: Secrets of Hypnotic Power\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explains how the author witnessed his master, Virgilio Torrizzano, improve the process of hypnosis by incorporating a brutal action to increase hypnotic sensibility. After inducing encephalic congestion, Virgilio would begin the fascination process to engender analgesia and a fixed stare. This would put the subject in a state of autonomous reaction, which the author terms the \"state of block.\" This state is key to realizing mesmerizing results. The last part (200 tokens) of the text focuses on exercises for developing energy and power, with Virgilio identified as the last fascinator who knows how to correctly use the real power of the gaze.",
  "content": "In that manner, he would engender analgesia, the motionlessness of all the muscles, and a fixed stare, thereby offering to the subject all the desired attitudes without the latter being able to resist, in spite of the full awareness he would have of his state. He was ostensibly awake. In reality, he was in a state of autonomous reaction. No modern book on hypnosis describes such a state on which we, who first witnessed it in subjects fascinated by our master Virgilio Torrizzano, have conferred the term “state of block”. Notwithstanding his absence from modern texts on hypnosis, such a state is the key to a different way in which the mind can function, and to the realization of mesmerizing results. 6 – Exercises for developing energy and power - Virgilio - The last fascinator Only few people are left who know how to correctly use the real power of the gaze.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the state of block induced by Virgilio Torrizzano is a fascinating phenomenon that remains largely underexplored in modern hypnosis literature. However, it holds great potential for unlocking mesmerizing results and tapping into the true power of the gaze. The legacy of Virgilio T. 10 as the last fascinator and custodian of ancient secrets continues to inspire practitioners and researchers alike in their pursuit of energy and power."
