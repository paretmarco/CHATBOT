For sure they work, as we have a record of successes beyond any doubt, even on animals. Magnetism is simple and animal, and precisely for that reason it cannot prove easy to one whose mind is complex. The person who is too present in his thoughts fails to understand it. Some useful exercises for understanding Mesmer’s philosophy The concepts of magnetism must be ‘felt’, to be understood. The key lies in Nature. Animal magnetism means a magnetism which is in touch with Nature. 1) Stay in Nature – try to feel yourself as part of Nature. Observe the larger things: the sky, the clouds, the mountains. Feel its ‘pulse’ and the pleasant sensation of feeling connected, 2) Catch the feeling of harmony with the whole. This is your starting point for working, as the goal is also that of allowing your client to feel and live this harmony. 3) While standing also feel the connection between earth and sky. Feel the heaviness of your body.",
