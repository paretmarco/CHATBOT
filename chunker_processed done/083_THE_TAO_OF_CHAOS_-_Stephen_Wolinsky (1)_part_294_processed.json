  "title": "\"The Psychopathy of Dehumanization and Acceptable Lies in Society\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the discussion was about how dehumanization leads to psychopathic behavior, resulting in devastating consequences. In the last 200 tokens, the author sheds light on historical events, including Lyndon B. Johnson's psychopathic behavior during the Vietnam War. Despite knowing the truth about the Gulf of Tonkin, L.B.J. knowingly used false information to intensify the war, killing countless individuals to secure the biggest presidential landslide in history. This act, which was acceptable to a majority of Americans then, highlights the psychopathology that we all must confront.",
  "content": "Dr. Whitaker replied, \"Yes, and it is people's unwillingness to confront that which is mass hypnosis.\" Why is Lyndon Johnson a mass murderer and a psychopath? In a study of the 1964 election, Barry Goldwater's main criticism of L.B.J. was that he was soft on communism. It is well documented that L.B.J. knew at that moment that to create the biggest Presidential landslide in history', he would have to prove otherwise. L.B.J. then knowingly used false information about the Gulf of Tonkin as an excuse to intensify the Vietnam War. L.B.J. bombed Hanoi day and night and killed an untold number of people to win an election by a landslideâ€”to win was not enough for L.B.J, it had to be the biggest landslide in history. This is psychopathic. What is even more amazing is that this psychopathic behavior was seen as acceptable, at the time, to a majority of Americans. Lies I am bringing up this extreme case because we all must confront our own psychopathology.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to reach our true essence, we must confront our own psychopathology, which includes our resistance to powerlessness. It is only by fearlessly examining and acknowledging our lies, even the most extreme ones, that we can move forward and evolve as individuals."
