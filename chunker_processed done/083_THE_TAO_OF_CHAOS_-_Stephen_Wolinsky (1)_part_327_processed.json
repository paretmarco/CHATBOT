  "title": "\"The Importance of Confronting Trauma: A Taoist Approach\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final segment, the focus shifts to the importance of confronting trauma in achieving psychological health. The author argues against using hypnosis solely for temporary coping, emphasizing instead the need for a Quantum Approach to discover our true selves. Excess stored-up energy from trauma can negatively impact present reality until it is addressed. The Tao of Chaos encourages the willingness to experience anything internally, even grief in the case of divorce. The author provides a case example illustrating the confusion that can result from divorce and a therapeutic note emphasizing the biological nature of grief.",
  "content": "It is only through working with the trauma that the excess energy of the observer is released, so that the observer no longer uses the trauma as a window from which to view present time reality. Psychological Health The first step in psychological health in the Tao of Chaos can be viewed in this way: The willingness to experience anything. This does not mean, \"Far-out, I want to get punched in the face.\" It does mean, however, that I am willing to experience whatever is going on with me in my internal subjective inner world. This willingness is the Tao of Chaos. Highlighted Case Example Therapist: How are you doing after the divorce? Client: I feel like I have lost my I-dentity since Ted and I broke up. Like now what do I do? In the past, I would always go along with what Ted wanted, so I am confused as to who I am, but I am trying to ignore that and get busy with my life. Therapeutic Note A sudden divorce after so many years of marriage is a shock to the system and carries grief. Grief is a biological process not a psychological one.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Tao of Chaos emphasizes the importance of being truly open to experiencing anything in order to achieve psychological health. When going through a difficult time such as a divorce, it's crucial to handle the grief and shock first before making any life decisions. By working through the trauma, the excess energy of the observer is released, leading to a clearer perspective of present time reality."
