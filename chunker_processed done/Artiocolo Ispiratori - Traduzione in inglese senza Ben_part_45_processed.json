  "first_phrase": "The story of Mesmer's fight against cynicism and intrigue sees him triumph in an indirect manner. After temporarily retiring, he returned to Lake Constance to immerse himself in natural knowledge without the distractions of language and reasoning. After three months, he emerged with heightened senses and a stronger magnetic power. His extraordinary personal qualities won him the admiration of prominent personalities and the support of noblewomen, propelling his rise to fame beyond even Voltaire's. This final section highlights Mesmer's popularity and the impact it had on his reputation.",
  "content": "Following his period, he came back strengthened, with his senses heightened and an even greater magnetic power. From an initial platform of qualities which were already of an eminently higher calibre, as he was knowledgeable, an artist, humorous, amiable and handsome, he further acquired at that stage an extraordinary hold on the frequenters of salons. He was, as per Deslon’s description, “a fiery soul in a body of iron”. Such a broad range of pleasing personal qualities won for him the admiration of the prominent personalities and the support of the noblewomen. There was no elegant lady in Paris who did not pay him a visit: Both noblewomen and bourgeois ladies took turns in extolling him. This special esteem in which he was held by members of the gentle sex was said to be a most important factor contributing to the rise of his reputation. Propelled forward by such powerful engine, his renown within the public opinion grew so much that the esteem he enjoyed surpassed Voltaire’s.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, despite facing envy and hatred, this individual's impressive personal qualities and magnetic power won the admiration and support of noblewomen and eminent personalities, propelling him to unmatched levels of fame and power in France. Though he could not sustain his brilliant social position due to opposition from erudite people, his legacy continues to fascinate and intrigue thinking minds."
