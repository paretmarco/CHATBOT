  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we have seen how Donato sets up the room before starting his sessions with the public. In this last part, we will witness Donato's remarkable ability in dealing with different types of people who come to be magnetized by him. We will give examples of incidents, the authenticity of which we can vouch for, as well as how Donato triumphed over the circumstances most unfavorable to his empire. Donato's mastery over his subjects will truly amaze and inspire you.",
  "content": "Then his voice takes the softest tones, he is insinuating (suggestionating) with dignity. His gaze is always tan, but do not throw vivid light. His words caress. If instead he understand from the first glance that he will be dealing with people having no other ideal than their bellies or their material appetites, people that came with preconceived ideas of malice, people with look of skepticism, he quickly prepares himself to the fight. A time, to a crowd that whistled him he would answer the challenge: - I am afraid of nothing and I fear no one. Five minutes later, this same crowd cheered in delight. He always stood up to the most violent storms, and he always triumphed over the circumstances most unfavorable to his empire, and put the most rebellious elements as help to its success. A Le Locle, by means of energy and eloquence sudden, he subjugated men who, forced by this unfortunate political passion from any blurring, joining in all, wanted to do some damage to him.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Donato was a remarkable figure whose energy and eloquence won over even the most skeptical crowds. He was unafraid of any challenge and triumphed over unfavorable circumstances, subjugating men with his sudden bursts of power. The authenticity of his many successes and anecdotes is guaranteed, making his legacy a testament to the enduring power of persuasion and determination."
