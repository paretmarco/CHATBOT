  "title": "The Clairvoyance of Somnambulists and its Influence on Modern Science",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text discuss the rare category of somnambulists who possess inexplicable clairvoyance and can discern the moral condition of the sick. They can also provide beneficial advice to the sick once the first symptoms of an ailment are discovered. Notable figures who believed in the power of somnambulists include Georget and Abbot G. B. Loubert, who believed that the perfect medicine is possessed by somnambulists in regards to their own persons. Loubert also believed in the somnambulists' ability to perceive sensations and impressions with superior vividness.",
  "content": "Abbot G. B. Loubert, in his lovely work “Magnetism and Somnambulism”, mentions therein what he stated to the knowledgeable bodies, the Rome-based court, and the theologians (Paris, 1844), namely: «It is possible to question a magnetized person, either verbally or mentally, concerning his own sicknesses (thereby achieving the best results) or those affecting distant persons, nay, even people who are totally unknown to him. In the latter instance, the magnetized person almost invariably asks for a handwritten letter of such individuals or some object they have personally touched, so as to be sure of establishing communication with those distant persons. Regardless of how ignorant he might be in his normal state, when he finds himself in the somnambulist state such individual far exceeds medical doctors, not in the field of erudition, but due to his exquisite nervous sensibility and the ability to perceive with greater ease sensations and impressions, which in such a state react inside his brain with superior vividness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Abbot G.B. Loubert's research on magnetism and somnambulism not only paved the way for new therapeutic dynamics but also contributed to the development of modern quantum theory. These groundbreaking experiments showed that the human mind and soul could transcend the senses, granting access to information beyond the realm of normal perception. As a result, Loubert's work remains relevant and valuable for researchers across fields in the present day."
