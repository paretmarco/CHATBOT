  "title": "\"The Art of Magnetism: Sensitivity and Self-Work for Fast Results\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text focus on the art of magnetism and the importance of sensitivity when conducting treatments in order to achieve fast results. It is compared to the standardized method of traditional medicine which can allow a doctor to treat many patients at once. The text explores how the tedious nature of magnetism led to the rise of medical clairvoyants and ultimately caused doctors to demand the exclusive right to practice magnetism, similar to how they are now demanding the exclusive right to hypnotize. The text highlights the importance of working on oneself, using all possible elements to help therapy, and not relying exclusively on standard procedures.",
  "content": "It was, moreover, the tediousness of the magnetic process that caused magnetizers to avail themselves so willingly of the services of the \"medical clairvoyant,\" who not only caused a relapse into the habit of administering drugs, but, by contributing largely to the magnetizer's reputation for quackery, and did much to strengthen the demand of the doctors that the right to magnetize should be confined to themselves. Magnetism can be very fast and often gives results in minutes, but for getting fast results it is necessary to: - Work on oneself - Use all possible elements that can help therapy - Rely on sensitivity - Avoid relying exclusively on standard procedures Only at this point can results be obtained very fast, sometimes in a matter of instants. The doctor's livelihood threatened The outcry of the doctors in the early part of 1800 for a monopoly of the right to magnetize is interesting to us, because it has its parallel today in a similar demand on their part for the exclusive right to hypnotize.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while magnetism can provide fast results, it is essential to work on oneself, use all possible elements in therapy, rely on sensitivity, and avoid relying exclusively on standard procedures. The doctorsâ€™ opposition to magnetism in the early 1800s for a monopoly of its right was to prevent its use rather than to benefit from it. The ability of animal magnetism to alleviate the suffering of others is a remarkable advantage and should not be overlooked."
