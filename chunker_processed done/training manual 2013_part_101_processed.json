  "first_phrase": "In the previous 200 tokens, we learned that doing passes is similar to active radioesthesia where we establish resonance with the client's perceived field of energy. Following our intuition is crucial. In this last part, we will go deeper into the various types of passes and their names, such as Longitudinal-passes, which are made lengthwise over the body, and Transverse-Passes, made across the body. Remember to follow your sensibility as a guide, but a basic knowledge of these passes is useful.",
  "content": "Names of the various type of passes The name of the pass27 generally indicates its object or intention, and method of performing it. The various kinds of Magnetic Passes are the following: - Longitudinal-Passes are passes made in a longitudinal manner, i.e., lengthwise over the body; e.g., Longitudinal-passes down the arms, are made by the Magnetiser passing his hands down from the shoulders to the fingers of the individual to be Magnetised. In Upper India28 the Magnetiser makes these passes with a necklace of large sandal-wood beads in his hand, which he passes over the body of his Subject, but it is to the charmed beads that the effect is attributed. Longitudinal-passes are often called Long-passes. The French name them, passes aux grandes courants. Among the Assamese, and natives of Upper India, they are known as Jarphoonk. - Transverse-Passes are passes made across the Subject's body, as from shoulder to shoulder. Right Transverse passes are made from the Operator's right to left. Left Transverse-passes are the reverse.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the various types of magnetic passes and their methods is crucial in performing effective magnetism. With knowledge of longitudinal, transverse, reverse, local, frictions, and drawing passes, a magnetizer can effectively magnetize their subject and achieve desired outcomes."
