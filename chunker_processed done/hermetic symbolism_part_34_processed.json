  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the Alchemists' symbols that represent different levels of being in the universe were explored. In this final section, the author delves deeper into the symbol of Salt, explaining that it is present in the foundation of everything that takes earthly form. The Salt of the Philosophers comes from the cosmic Ocean, splitting from Alum, and is not to be confused with everyday table salt. The symbol of Salt, along with the Circle and Cross, is a language of signs that reveals the subtle elements and ideas of alchemical theories.",
  "content": "They all take the name of Salts; however, Salt itself, the most indispensable and most widely used salt par excellence, is Sea Salt . We must take good care not to confuse this with our everyday table salt. The Salt of the Philosophers comes from the cosmic Ocean, having been split from Alum . The horizontal diametrical line splits the circle and in doing so becomes the separating firmament between the heavenly Waters and the earthly Waters. So we are no longer dealing with that indeterminate, somewhat abstract Chaos, to which no qualities can be attributed. The horizontal bar crossing the Circle gives it the quality of a substance, which is still insensible, but comprehensible. 10 Words give only a very cumbersome translation of the ideas that these symbols give us to understand. To speak of an immaterial connection, that gives things the sub-stratum of their apparent stability, is to express ourselves with an infuriating clumsiness. Salt is present in the base of everything that takes earthly form. It is part of the means by which everything is brought into being , thanks to the combined action of Sulphur and of Mercury , as we will explain later on.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the significance of Salt in alchemy goes beyond its common usage as a seasoning. Its extraction from salt marshes and transformation into the body of the Stone of the Sages represents its stabilizing foundation of all tangible bodies. The Salt of the Philosophers is a symbol of wisdom and piety, representing the transformation of substances from their chaotic state to their earthly realizations of the divine."
