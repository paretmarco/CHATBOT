  "title": "\"10 Basic Exercises for Developing Life Force\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve into the ten basic exercises of the School of Magnetism, which aim to cultivate life force and strengthen certain faculties. These exercises emphasize the importance of willpower, energy (nervous, sexual, and pranic), polarities, the power of the gaze, words of power, working with animals, projecting the self, and sensitivity. They are designed to help individuals develop greater control over themselves and harness the power of nature. These exercises can be a useful tool for those seeking to improve their mental and physical capabilities.",
  "content": "One of the most required faculties is not to blink. This exercise is also in Raja Yoga and consists of fixating an object with maximal attention. Other exercises consist in expanding the vision and cultivating the memory. 4 - Polarities: The person working in this direction will learn to develop polarities within himself and to strengthen his ability to work with both sides of its brain. 5 - Words of Power: These are words which will bring energy to the person when it is most needed. They are created with a complex system that seeks to integrate man in the universe. 6 - Animals: The person who wants to increase his life force must work with animals before working with other people. The animal is not sensible to the power of suggestion, and therefore will show better to the student the advancements acquired. 7 – Projection of the self: This is another powerful capability: projecting himself in things or people. It is the basis of emitting life force. In this category we also put projecting himself in the future. 8 – Sensitivity: To emit energy someone must be able to feel it. Sensitivity means the capability to feel sensation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing faculties such as attention, memory, polarities, words of power, working with animals, projection of self, sensitivity, and self-development, along with understanding magnetism, can significantly enhance your life force. By working on yourself and your abilities, you can tap into your inner strength and become more integrated into the universe, unlocking your full potential."
