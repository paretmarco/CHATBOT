  "title": "\"Physical Quantum Magnetism Techniques for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the effectiveness of physical quantum magnetism techniques in healing various physical and psychological ailments has been explained. These techniques have been used and examined by high profile doctors and yield positive results, even in cases where classical methods fail. The last 200 tokens of the text explain the various states that these techniques can help achieve, such as magnetic ecstasy and magnetic sleep, and give an example of a person who cured their epilepsy using these techniques. The text also mentions that understanding the effects of these techniques can be explained through the framework of quantum science, which is the most modern branch of physics.",
  "content": "Further to the aforesaid, we might reap the advantage of fastest healing results concerning an array of pathologies which do not easily lend themselves to being successfully treated by classical methods, e.g. epilepsy or other such situations. To give one illustrating example, a person who eventually turned into one of our coaches used to suffer precisely from epileptic manifestations 1. He eventually succeeded in overcoming them through the use of magnetic and fully non-verbal techniques. Techniques are susceptible of being developed until such a point where specific states bearing the under-mentioned appellations are reached: Lethargy Magnetic ecstasy – It consists in a particular state of exaltation, which can be heightened by resorting to music Magnetic sleep – It is a state in which intuitions might be experienced, as well as clairvoyance and opening oneself up to higher dimensions. Exteriorised action is something very real, despite the fact that even nowadays official science finds it often hard to picture it correctly. Quantum science is the most modern part of physics and probably is one of the best frameworks we have to give a theoretical explanations to it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is possible to achieve healing results for various pathologies through the use of magnetic and fully non-verbal techniques. Even difficult cases such as epilepsy can be overcome with these techniques. By constantly developing and enhancing this personal power, one can reach heightened states of awareness and intuition, allowing for a better understanding of the world around us."
