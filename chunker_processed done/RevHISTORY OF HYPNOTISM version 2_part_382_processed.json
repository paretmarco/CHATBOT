  "title": "What are some examples of how suggestion can influence a person's behavior and perception under hypnosis?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Dr. Elliotson's experiments on mesmerism and suggestion were discussed. In the last 200 tokens, Teste mentions another instance of this phenomenon involving a patient called Mons. Pradhier. Dr. Elliotson also investigated the mesmeric promise, now known as \"Suggestion,\" and conducted experiments with it. He induced Miss Collins to imagine her maid in a certain way and a lady to imagine herself in a jar of flowers. These experiments demonstrate the power of suggestion and its potential to influence our perceptions and actions.",
  "content": "Pradhier awoke he spoke like a Parisian born; but next day he had somewhat relapsed into his \"Hamburg peculiarities,\" and was remagnetised; and a few more repetitions of the Suggestion (as we would call it) made the Parisian accent permanent; insomuch that â€œone might listen to Mons, Pradhier for whole hours without ever suspecting his birthplace.\" Dr. Elliotson investigated the mesmeric promise, and all that seems to be wanting in many of his experiments to bring them up to date today is the name \"Suggestion.\" Here is a case in point:- \"She (Miss Collins) promised to see her maid sitting in the room with her bonnet on as soon as she awoke, and not after I coughed. I awoke her; she was astonished at the sight, and looked displeased; but as soon as I coughed, saw her sitting as usual, with her cap on. She could not comprehend this, and thought her maid was hiding the bonnet behind her back.\" Another case, which presents some singular features, is that of a lady whom Elliotson induced to promise that when she awoke she would fancy herself inside a little jar that contained flowers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of suggestion through hypnosis or mesmerism can have a profound impact on an individual's perceptions and behaviors. As demonstrated by Dr. Elliotson's experiments, simple suggestions can create vivid, realistic experiences that the subject fully believes in. While such techniques may have fallen out of mainstream medical usage, the concept of suggestion remains an important tool for those seeking to modify personal behaviors or mindsets."
