  "title": "\"Exploring Parallel Worlds Within Our Minds\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author explains how energy systems within energy systems are formed and the role past experiences play in them. This last section presents an exercise called \"Tao of Chaos Exercise #4\" that allows the reader to experience parallel worlds within the emptiness behind their eyelids. Through merging with memories, energy worlds collapse into each other resulting in a chain of similar events. The author draws upon Freud's concept of \"chains of earlier similar events\" to explain how similar events attract one another and form an associational network or chain of events. The exercise helps readers understand how parallel worlds exist side-by-side in space and can be experienced through the effects they generate.",
  "content": "Notice how by merging with the planet (bubble) you experience excitement at merging with memories (energy worlds) collapsed with memories (energy worlds). Once again notice how this chain of events or similar energies are attracted and collapsed in our vacation world with similar vacation worlds. When you open your eyes, you can probably even experience directly a feeling in that body of yours of relaxation or excitement. Freud said it this way; \"traumas are connected in chains of earlier similar events.\" Not only traumas, but all similar events attract one another and form an associational network or chain of similar events. What you have experienced is parallel worlds: the \"I don't get it\" planet, which contains energy within condensed energy in the form of memories or sensations forming one world; and right next to it, side-by-side, with planet \"vacation\" and its world. All of us can consider that in the emptiness there are many worlds side-by-side floating in space. As \"you\" enter into each world you can experience its effects and that they all exist in parallel worlds.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of parallel worlds within our internal reality is an important aspect to consider in understanding the nature of our personalities. These worlds, separated by space and composed of different roles or sub-personalities, have the ability to attract and collapse with each other, forming an associational network of similar events. By recognizing and exploring these parallel worlds, we can gain a greater understanding of ourselves and the experiences we encounter."
