  "title": "Understanding Psychopathic Trance & Society's Psychopathology",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the psychopathic structure and how it is formed as a defense mechanism against powerlessness. It mentions the mental manipulation in which a person creates an illusion of power in a situation where they are helpless. It also talks about how society reinforces this understanding, victimizes the victim and is responsible for the psychopathology of our society. The latter part mentions the examples of a little girl and a boy who are sexually abused and how society's double standards and psychopathology induce psychopathic trances and lead to their abuse of others. The following 200 tokens explore the concept of the Psychopathic Society and the Judge, Jury, and Executioner acting in all the wrong ways and places.",
  "content": "For example, if three men rape a woman, the defense attorney makes it look like the woman was in charge and made these poor little men rape her (\"It was what she wanted,\" or \"Why was she there in the first place?\"). This is society's psychopathology, the victim is imagined to be the perpetrator and the perpetrator is made to be seen as the poor innocent victim. This is the sickness of our society. The 3-year-old little girl is not wrong or bad for imagining herself to be in chargeâ€”it was a survival mechanism. However, it is a subtle internal manipulation of the illusion of power. Another unfortunate example in our society is men who were raped as children. Because of society's double standard and psychopathology, a boy who is sexually abused by a woman is seen as lucky. After all, being forced to have oral sex with an older woman for a small male child is good for him. These psychopathic trances induced by society help to hypnotize the young boy, and later often leads to their abuse of others. The old Gestalt Therapy adage, \"Do unto others, that which was done unto you.\"",
  "last_phrase": "It is important to recognize the difference between psychopathic structures or trances, and being a psychopath. Society's double standards and psychopathology can have lasting and detrimental effects on victims of sexual abuse, often causing them to manipulate their internal state to survive. Awareness and therapy can help break this cycle and prevent further abuse in the future."
