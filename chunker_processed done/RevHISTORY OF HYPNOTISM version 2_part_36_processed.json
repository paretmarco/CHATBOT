  "content": "Writing in 1779, Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815) listed 27 propositions concerning this force, which he defined as a universal fluid that emanated from the heavenly bodies and that was present in nature (Mesmer, 1779/19801). To be more precise Mesmer pointed out that this is a technique which requires sensitivity. He said: “Magnetism can be compared to a sixth sense. The senses are neither defined nor described. They are rather felt. One cannot explain to a blind man what colours are. One would necessitate him to be able to “feel”, them, that is, to see them. The same holds true for magnetism. It must be mainly transmitted through inward feeling. It is only feeling that can make the theory of it understandable” Practical hint: try to develop your sensitivity. Open yourself up to this part of you. It is like another sense you must discover Why use the word “fluid”? With regards to the word “fluid” there are many misconceptions in both popular and even scientific books. The simpler way to think about it is vital energy.",
