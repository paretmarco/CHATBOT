  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the evolution of magnetism from Mesmer's theory of a universal medium to de Puysegur's experimental approach. De Puysegur's modification eliminated violent crises, replacing them with a peaceful slumber to help patients access internal knowledge and remedies. In the last 200 tokens, we learn about the two complementary approaches to magnetism: Mesmer's theory of free circulation of a universal fluid and Puysegurean's approach of vital magnetism transfer between individuals. This theory emphasizes the individual's influence and intention, creating an entanglement between the operator and the patient. In other words, the operator and patient’s energy is interconnected, and the patient can feel the energy.",
  "content": "A great development is received, and an extraordinary instinct exhibits itself in the patient, who then acquires an internal knowledge as well as the remedies suitable to his disorder; sometimes even his senses become so delicate as to enable him to perceive the morbid causes and their remedies.” A. Didier Two different complementary approaches Germany Mesmer's original theory of a universal medium or “fluid”, the free and regular circulation of which through a human being produced health, while any obstruction, or impediment to that free circulation, caused disease France Puysegurean or Experimental School: sickness arises from want of an adequate supply of the vital magnetism which is degenerated by the organism itself, and which one person can impart to another, or aid him in extracting from the circum-ambient ether This approach echoes Paracelsus’ theory and it is similar to some oriental views. To make it work it is necessary to put intention and “let things happen”. This second theory is more simple and centered on the individual and its influence. In quantum terms it is an entanglement or cointrication: As the operator is entangled together with the subject the subject will feel the energy24. The subject will feel it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these two complementary approaches, Mesmer's theory of a universal medium and Puysegurean's experimental school, have provided a deeper understanding of the connection between the mind and body in healing. Hypnotic anesthesia has revolutionized the field of medicine, eliminating excruciating pain during surgery. By harnessing internal knowledge and remedies, one can exhibit an extraordinary instinct in curing their disorders, acquiring a delicate perception of morbid causes and their remedies."
