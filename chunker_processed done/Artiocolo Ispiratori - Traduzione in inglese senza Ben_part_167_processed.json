  "first_phrase": "In \"Light in Magnetism and Fascination,\" the use of light and reflections are crucial for mesmerists. The author connects this concept with ancient alchemists who worked on fire and believed in its ability to enhance change. The article also highlights the benefits of a particular methodology for better concentration, school results, and enhancing magnetic techniques for intuition and creativity. Additionally, it is helpful for those with dysgraphia and dyslexia. The text includes a quote from Johannnes Helmond and mentions Apollonius of Tyana's use of prayer to the sun.",
  "content": "He is the archeus of nature who moves and digests the matter, when he is given his Freedom; he does all the work in her (nature). In the interim, the Central-Fire lies hidden under a hard shell, still weak and unable. It is only a Fire in potentia that will show its power as soon as it is awakened through the external Fire. The Alchemists call it Ignis, or at times, call it their red Lion or Gabritius. It is the fire of thegold, the true gold-sulphur, the soul of the elements, and the light of nature. Without its influence, the intelligence would be weak, the power of the imagination would be dead, the spirit would be unfruitful, and the body would be lifeless”. Apollonius of Tyana was born around 4 BC at Tyana, in Cappadocia, and is last heard of in Ephesus over 100 years later. Philostratus frequently mentions Apollonius’ prayers to the sun, something for which we do not find antecedents in the Pythagorean literature.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the teachings of Apollonius of Tyana remind us of the importance of acknowledging the power of the sun in our lives. Although we should not look directly at the sun, the practice of sun-gazing can bring about physical, mental, and spiritual benefits, and is worth exploring with caution and under the guidance of experts."
