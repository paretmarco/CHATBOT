  "title": "\"The Esoteric Symbolism of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin in Catholicism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author puts forward the idea that the Holy Spirit is the result of divine thought that takes bodily form in a receptive consciousness of exceptional purity. This concept is used to explain the Catholic belief that the Holy Spirit fertilised an immaculate Virgin. The author also notes that different esoteric traditions share commonalities, and that recognising these similarities can lead to a deeper understanding of their symbolic meaning. In the last 200 tokens, the author suggests that the Tarot can be used as a tool for interpreting initiatic symbolism, and specifically points to the Empress card as representing the Virgin in the painting of Saint Maurice.",
  "content": "The truth is that the idea of Christ held by the reverend Fathers of the 17th century did not, perhaps, coincide with that of the Baby Jesus of devotees today: it was conceptualised on an infinitely higher level. Ultimately, if the picture under scrutiny is sinful in any way from the religious point of view, it is precisely because it is excessively Catholic, in the strict sense of the word. It is an attempt to Catholicise or universalize far beyond the limits of that which the dimly lit faith of a flock, that does not honour its divine shepherd, could recognise. In order to interpret the initiatic symbolism of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance more precisely, nothing is more useful than the twenty-two kabbalistic trumps of the Tarot. We have to see, in them, the true Alphabet of the initiates, by way of which a wise spirit can learn to decipher certain graphical mysteries that are charged with translating secrets that would be dangerous to spread indiscriminately. So let us unfold before us the images of this mysterious treatise of high philosophy, and search for our Virgin from the painting at Saint Maurice. We will recognise her immediately in the Empress of Arcanum III.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbolism of the Virgin in the painting at Saint Maurice can be better understood through the initiatic symbolism of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, particularly the twenty-two kabbalistic trumps of the Tarot. The Empress of Arcanum III represents the Queen of Heaven, the virginal Mother of all things, linking her to the creator of idealistic forms and emblems of ideas that shape the whole of creation. Ultimately, this ethereal personage resides in the sublime realms of pure intelligence, above the changeable, sub-lunar world."
