  "title": "What Can We Learn From Lafontaine's Magnetizing Method and Success Rate?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about Charles Lafontaine and his method of magnetizing, which emphasizes the importance of remaining cool and confident during the process. In the last 200 tokens, Lafontaine's techniques for addressing minor difficulties that may arise during magnetizing are described along with a drawing of an example experiment he conducted. The text also discusses how Lafontaine's method can be used to induce a state of catalepsy and provides a table of illnesses that were healed or improved by Lafontaine during his stay in England. The text concludes by highlighting the usefulness of Lafontaine's method in helping people to relax and prepare for magnetic therapy, as well as offering a quantum interpretation of its healing effects.",
  "content": "This state can be induced in most people in less than five minutes, by using the non verbal techniques of the gaze and of the passes. What we can learn from Lafontaine: If you want to learn how to magnetize, Lafontaine’s method is very simple. All you need to do is reinforce your gaze. You can do it by looking at a mirror. Don’t worry if complete somnambulism occurs at the beginning. Lafontaine’s method can also be very useful for helping someone to relax or to prepare him/her for “magnetic therapy”. A quantum interpretation of the usefulness of the method of Lafontaine is that we “entangle” with the subject as we perform a magnetic induction. From this point on we can proceed in creating change. Table with the illnesses healed or improved thanks to Charles Lafontaine during his staying in England Charles Lafontaine had a very high success rate in his practice. Here is a table with the cases he treated while he wrote his book “L’art de magnetiser” and travelled through England. His memories offer us a very detailed account of the experiences he had, the people he met, and what was done each day.",
  "last_phrase": "Overall, Lafontaine's method of magnetizing through the reinforcement of one's gaze is a practical and effective technique that can induce a state of somnambulism in most people in under five minutes. Not only can this technique be used for magnetizing, but it can also help individuals relax and prepare for magnetic therapy. Charles Lafontaine's high success rate in his practice, as evidenced by his table of healed and improved cases, suggests that this method can be a valuable tool in promoting healing and change."
