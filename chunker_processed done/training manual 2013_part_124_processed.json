  "title": "\"The Illusion of Time: Understanding the Connection Between Magnetism and Different Perceptions of Time\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the link between time perception and energy sensitivity in magnetism practice. The author argues that time perception is a construct of the mind, and that staying in the present moment is the key to feeling energy. The concept of time varies across cultures, as seen in the Quiche Indian tribe of Guatemala. Understanding this connection is crucial for practitioners of magnetism. The last section dives deeper into the Quiche tribe's unique perception of time, suggesting that events are not linear and isolated but rather \"present facts.\"",
  "content": "Moreover, both staying in the future and in the past means staying in virtually, and only in the present we can feel energy. As St. Augustine wrote: \"the past is only memory and the future is only anticipation, both being present facts\"30. TIME, DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND POPULATIONS Not all the populations feel and share the same sense of time You will see that the work you do with magnetism is closely connected to how people feel time. The more in the present you are, the higher the sensibility will be. After having lived with the Quiche Indian tribe of Guatemala, the anthropologist Barbara Tedlock come to the point that they don't experience a flow of time. Whereas, we isolate the concept of time into \"moments\" which start and end, and as Barbara Tedlock writes, \"at no given time, past, present or future it is possible to isolate a certain time from events which tied up to it and which flow from it\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the varying perceptions of time among different populations and cultivating a present-focused mindset can lead to greater sensitivity and awareness, particularly in activities that use magnetism. Additionally, our understanding and experience of time affects our rational thinking and self-consciousness."
