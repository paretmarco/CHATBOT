  "title": "The History and Science of Hypnotism: From Animal Magnetism to Exact Science",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve deeper into the history of physical healing, particularly the phenomenon of animal magnetism or hypnotism. The author emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between hypnotism and animal magnetism as the latter is no longer practiced. Although the power of influencing others' minds and bodies has attracted much attention throughout history for various purposes, it has also been discredited due to quacks and charlatans. Nonetheless, in recent times, physiologists and physicians have been investigating the science behind this phenomenon. This exploration is backed up with various historical examples, including Valentine Greatrakes' healing powers and the testimonies of renowned scientific and theological personalities.",
  "content": "It Is also known that among the Chaldarans, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Hindus, the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans many of the priests effected cures or threw people into deep sleeps in the shades of the temples; during which the sleeper sometimes had prophetic dreams and, that they otherwise produced effects like those now referred to animal magnetism. Such influences were held to be supernatural, and no doubt they gave power to the priesthood. In the middle of the 17th Century there appeared in England several persons who said they had the power of curing diseases by stroking with the hand. Notable amongst these was Valentine Greatrakes, of Affane in the Country of Waterford, Ireland, who was born in February 1628, and who attracted great attention in England by his supposed power of curing the kingâ€™s evil, or Scrofula. Many of the most distinguished scientific and theological men of the day, such as Robert Bryle and R. Cudworth, witnessed and attested the cures supposed to be effected by Greatrakes, and thousands of sufferers crowded to him from all parts of the kingdom.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, history is filled with accounts of individuals who claimed to possess supernatural or mysterious powers of healing or control over others, from ancient civilizations to more modern times. While some may have genuinely believed in their powers, it is important to approach such claims with a critical eye and rely on scientific evidence-based medicine for true healing."
