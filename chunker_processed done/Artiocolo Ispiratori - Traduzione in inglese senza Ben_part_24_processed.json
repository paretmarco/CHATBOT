  "first_phrase": "This text highlights the teachings of M. Philippe, who chaired the Durville brothers' Lyon school of magnetism, a renowned figure in French magnetism with a far-reaching influence. His courses had a powerful impact on loyal listeners eager to heal sick patients. M. Philippe emphasized the importance of having a particular inner attitude to cure sick people by magnetism. In the last 200 tokens, the Master describes the unique features of his brand of magnetism and the necessary qualities that individuals need to achieve exceptional therapeutic results, such as love, forgiveness, acceptance of life and ridding oneself of emotional burdens.",
  "content": "Thereupon, the Master would emphasize the characteristic features of his brand of magnetism thus: «In order to practice the customary form of magnetism – he once said –, one needs to be very strong; by contrast, what is necessitated by practicing our form of magnetism is that we should be weak, that is, charitable and with a humble heart, since it would be enough for one who is truly small to say, ‘I would like this child to heal’, for his wish to come true». The key words related to M. Philippe’s work, which we would like to say ought to be peculiar to all those desirous of accomplishing exceptional therapeutic results, are the following: Love and a feeling of connection with fellow human beings and the Divine quality of the universe, forgiveness, a deeply felt intention and motivating urge, acceptance of life, and the decision to rid oneself of emotional burdens.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you strive to achieve exceptional therapeutic results and connect with the universe, M. Philippe's key principles of magnetism such as love, forgiveness, acceptance of life, and the decision to rid oneself of emotional burdens are crucial. Adhering to such advice can bring about surprising and concrete results as illustrated by experiments conducted in his courses. So, why not give it a try and experience the power of magnetism to transform and heal lives?"
