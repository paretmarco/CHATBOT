  "title": "\"The Hermeticism of Vitriol, Animal Magnetism, & Mineral Vitality\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores the representation of life modalities through the symbolism of the Cross and Vitriol in alchemy. The author defines the balance between active and passive life forces in the vegetable kingdom, the predominance of activity in the animal kingdom, and stability through passive forces in minerals. The Vitriol sign represents the dual aspects of animal vitality and the transformative power of rectification to uncover the Philosophers' Stone within oneself. In the final 200 tokens, the author highlights the connection between mineral vitality and the World ideogram. The latter expresses minerals as the foundation of unlimited life, reflecting the infinite potential inherent in human nature.",
  "content": "He knew of the formula linked to the word VITRIOLUM, which is an acronym of the famous phrase: Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem, Veram Medicinam. Visit the bowels of the Earth refers to the practice of retreating to the very depths of ones self and to the deepening of human nature. Locked away in the secret laboratory of our own self, in our hermetically sealed Philosopher’s Stone, we must then rectify - distil the substance, separate the subtle from the dense. Thus will we find the hidden Stone which holds the True Medicine. The secret of Vitriol transforms man into the object of the Great Work of the philosophers. Every one of us carries the Philosophers’ Stone hidden inside them, the True Medicine, which has the power to cure all ills. There is nothing absurd in all of this, nothing naively miraculous, only the assertion that everything is contained within Man, provided that he can learn to know himself and to use the inexhaustible resources of his own nature wisely. The spirit of the world Mineral vitality is referenced in the ideogram of the World, which expresses the quality of minerals as the basis for unlimited life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Vitriolum formula serves as a metaphorical representation of a journey toward self-discovery and personal growth. By acknowledging the mineral qualities in all things and recognizing the Philosopher’s Stone within ourselves, we can tap into the unlimited potential of our own nature. Although Hermetists in the past may have lacked the scientific knowledge we possess today, their method of using symbolism and speculative deduction to solve complex problems can serve as a valuable lesson in creative problem-solving and innovation."
