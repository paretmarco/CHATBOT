  "title": "Animal Magnetism: A Tale of Two Approaches.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we learned about the two different approaches to magnetism in Germany and France, with Mesmer's original theory of a universal medium and Puysegurean or Experimental School's approach. Now, in the last 200 tokens, we delve deeper into the Puysegurean School's modification of Mesmer's techniques. De Puysegur substituted the use of the baquet with simple contact or spoken orders, resulting in a calmer, healthier, and peaceful slumber. These curative crises were said to evolve into the most remarkable one called somnambulism. In this state, patients acquired an internal knowledge of their disorders and their remedies. Furthermore, the experimental school's approach echoes Paracelsus' theory and is centered on the individual's influence. It requires putting intention and letting things happen, culminating in the subject feeling the energy.",
  "content": "A great development is received, and an extraordinary instinct exhibits itself in the patient, who then acquires an internal knowledge as well as the remedies suitable to his disorder; sometimes even his senses become so delicate as to enable him to perceive the morbid causes and their remedies.” A. Didier Two different complementary approaches Germany Mesmer's original theory of a universal medium or “fluid”, the free and regular circulation of which through a human being produced health, while any obstruction, or impediment to that free circulation, caused disease France Puysegurean or Experimental School: sickness arises from want of an adequate supply of the vital magnetism which is degenerated by the organism itself, and which one person can impart to another, or aid him in extracting from the circum-ambient ether This approach echoes Paracelsus’ theory and it is similar to some oriental views. To make it work it is necessary to put intention and “let things happen”. This second theory is more simple and centered on the individual and its influence. In quantum terms it is an entanglement or cointrication: As the operator is entangled together with the subject the subject will feel the energy85. The subject will feel it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Animal Magnetism, despite being declared dead by some academic bodies, continued to spread and evolve throughout Europe in the early 1800s. Its two complementary approaches, one focused on a universal fluid and the other on individual influence, drew from both western and eastern philosophies. Today, this practice serves as a reminder of the ongoing exploration of alternative healing methods."
