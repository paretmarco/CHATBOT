  "title": "Healing Through Mesmerism: Puysegur's Experiences and Insights",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section, we explore the practicality of mesmerism and its ability to induce a stable state to promote healing in both humans and animals. Marquis de Puysegur's method of magnetizing an elm at Buzancy and connecting patients to it showed promising results, leading to a rapid increase in demand for his services. Puysegur's attention to nature and air, which he claimed as a fluid, brought focus to the importance of breathing practices for both the operator and the client in magnetism. The editor also notes that consistent breathing exercises can increase the effectiveness of magnetism.",
  "content": "The patients were seated on stone benches round this tree, with cords connecting its branches with the affected parts of their bodies, and they formed a chain by linking their thumbs together. Meanwhile de Puysegur chose from among his patients several subjects who, through contact with his hands or on the presentation of a metallic tractor, fell into the ordinary crisis, and this soon passed into a sleep in which all physical faculties appeared to be suspended, while the mental faculties were enlarged. Puysegur had in fact strong attention to Nature. He called his process vegeto-magnetic He brought the attention also on the importance of the air in helping the magnetic process. Intuitively affirmed that “the air is the fluid”15, in the same way as in the Indian practice of Yoga the air is ‘prana’, vital force. Editor’s note: the act of breathing is fundamental even for the operator. All magnetists do breathing exercises. In the morning do 3 or 4 deep breathings. Do the same before working with your client. If you practice magnetism you will increase your results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's approach to mesmeric healing through the enlargement of mental faculties, particularly clairvoyance, has yielded invaluable insights into the healing potential of magnetism. By emphasizing the importance of breathing exercises and the role of air, he demonstrated a strong appreciation of the natural elements involved in this process. His work continues to inspire investigations into the unknown potential of mesmeric healing for both the affected individuals and those around them."
