  "title": "\"The Struggle for Recognition: Mesmerism and the Scientific Institutions\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text recounts the story of Franz Anton Mesmer, whose ideas on animal magnetism led to heated debates in France and beyond. Despite opposition, he proved the effectiveness of his doctrine through miraculous healings. The last 200 tokens detail the Royal Academy of Berlin's recognition of Mesmer's theory and failed attempt to invite him to Germany, as well as his death in Switzerland. The text also touches on Mesmer's beliefs and the nature of those who create revolutionary ideas.",
  "content": "However hard they try to regain their primordial independence, to detach their destiny, that is, from the one befalling the system they have originated, all they do is to engage in futile efforts. Their work is akin to Sisyphus’ -, since the latter, regardless of his actual intention, causes the rock smashing him to pieces to fall over his body: Nothing can remove them from the work they themselves have imposed on their persons». Afterwards, France, too, witnessed a number of turnabouts, while in 1831 the Royal Academy of Paris recognized the existence of animal magnetism, as well as the wonderful effects of induced somnambulism. Once Mesmer had proven his doctrine through the medium of unexpected instances of healing, which were visible and undoubted witnesses of the truth, magnetism was confronted by the most intriguing passions being unleashed against it, and it was compelled to endure an unceasing fight against numerous and powerful adversaries. Such bitter wrangle has invariably gone one, with greater or lesser fierceness, between defenders and opponents of the new science.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while new scientific discoveries often face fierce opposition and criticism, it is important to focus on the evidence and acknowledge the contributions of scientific institutions in studying and recognizing the truth. Despite the challenges faced by animal magnetism, the Royal Academy of Paris ultimately acknowledged its existence and effectiveness through research and experimentation, highlighting the importance of evidence-based decision-making. As such, it is critical to approach new ideas with an open and critical mind, while also recognizing the invaluable role that scientific institutions can play in advancing our understanding of the world around us."
