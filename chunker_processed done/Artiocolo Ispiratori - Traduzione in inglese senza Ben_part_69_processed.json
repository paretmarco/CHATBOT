  "title": "\"7 Phases Technique: A Self-Treatment for Overcoming Negative Habits\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this article, we explore a technique for self-improvement, which involves a series of steps to be followed. In the first phase, one must identify the negative habit they wish to eliminate, and then look into a mirror while formulating their resolution. The subsequent phases involve physical touch, massage, and visualization, aimed at generating positive feelings and thoughts. Finally, one must stare at a light and close their eyes to experience a sensation of openness and well-being. This last part focuses on Phases 4-7 of the technique, providing a step-by-step guide to follow.",
  "content": "PHASE 4: Move your hand to the solar plexus, almost as if you wanted to speak to your stomach, your enteric brain, and request its collaboration while you think how nice it is to be in a good state of health. Try and think in images or sensations more than in words. PHASE 5: Implement some steps by simultaneously passing the right hand over the left arm and the left hand over the right arm, as if you were shaking off dust from yourselves, while you think over negative habits better. PHASE 6: If you feel the need to do so, you should repeat phases 4 and 5. PHASE 7: Stare at a light (white, maximum 75 Watts) placed one meter ahead of you, and then close your eyes. You will see a luminous trace. Keep looking at it until it disappears. Results: Provided the technique has been carried out properly, you should immediately feel an indefinable sensation of openness, of well-being.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, implementing these simple steps can lead to an immediate feeling of openness and well-being, as well as a reduction in the desire associated with your negative habits. However, it's important to note that specific adjustments may be necessary depending on your individual needs. With intuition and persistence, you can find the best possible balance for yourself."
