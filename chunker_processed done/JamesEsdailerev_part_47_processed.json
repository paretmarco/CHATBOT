  "title": "\"Magnetic Sleep: Curing a Peasant's Inflammation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author shared two instances of successful healing through magnetism. In the final 200 tokens, the author recounts their experiences while helping a young peasant suffering from inflammation on the chest. The author employed their magnetising techniques to induce a tranquil sleep in the patient, freeing him from pain and convulsions. They then inspired positive ideas in him, causing him to move his body as if he were to dance. By following this regimen daily, the patient witnessed noticeable improvements in his health.",
  "content": "I cherished these ideas in him, and thereby I forced him to move himself with considerable activity on his chair, as if he were to dance to an air which, by singing mentally, I made him repeat quite loudly. By these means I made the patient sweat profusely from that day. After an hour's crisis I quieted him, and left the room. A drink was now given to him, and having ordered some bread and broth to be brought to him, I made him eat a considerable quantity on that same evening, which is something he had not been able to do for the last five days. He slept that entire night; and the next day, not remembering my visit of the previous evening, he informed me of the improved state of his health. I gave him two crises: Wednesday and Thursday I had the satisfaction of seeing him affected merely with a slight shivering. Every day I had the patient's feet put into water for the space of three hours, and gave him two crises a day.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism led to significant improvements in his patient's health. By inducing crises, providing sustenance, and maintaining foot baths, Puysegur was able to help his patient return to his usual activities. Puysegur also discovered that those in a magnetic sleep state could connect with nature and react at a distance. These findings could be useful in improving therapeutic practices for individuals experiencing health issues."
