  "title": "\"Unblocking Life Force: Mesmer's Approach to Healing Crisis\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we discussed Mesmer's idea on solving problems through increasing symptoms to trigger nature's healing crisis. Mesmer believes that all sicknesses are caused by a blockage in the flow of energy. This blockage can be removed by unblocking the life force, also known as kundalini or chi, through practices such as Kundalini awakening dance. In the last 200 tokens, we explore how this life force has a sexual and possessive aspect, which condenses into desires and cravings. We also look at how the animal mind becomes monoideistic, focusing on one thing during moments of excitement, such as sex or fear.",
  "content": "The therapist opens the channels again so that the vapors of the kundalini may rise again without causing pain. Practice of Kundalini awakening dance can help in removing of the barriers10. In the western tradition, this life force has a sexual aspect, but not only. We could call it as it directs itself in the world \"desire\". This desire becomes for many become a \"craving\" when this desire will \"condense\" itself on different objects. The condensation of the sexual force and its desire will create the sentimental/affective part in man. The condensation of the desire to have things is the possessive part in man. How this condensation occurs? Firstly we have the manifestation of the basis energy. When the animal mind is excited, it tries to go in one direction and become monoideistic. For example, in sex, it concentrates on the partner and on the sexual act. In the case of fear, it concentrates on the person or the thing creating the fear.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of Kundalini awakening dance can be a transformative practice for removing the barriers that hinder us from experiencing the fullness of life. By opening the channels and allowing the kundalini energy to rise without pain, we can learn to manage our desires and prevent them from turning into cravings that possess us. Ultimately, this can lead to a greater sense of control over our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions, helping us to live more consciously and purposefully."
