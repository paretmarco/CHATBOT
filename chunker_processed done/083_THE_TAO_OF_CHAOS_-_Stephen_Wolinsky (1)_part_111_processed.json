  "title": "\"The Power of Bifurcation Point in Gestalt Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores Fritz Perls' Gestalt therapy, which involves asking clients to \"exaggerate\" their feelings and stay with them to reveal a new understanding. The concept of bifurcation point and second implicate order is explained using an example from the movie Lawrence of Arabia. By intensifying and exaggerating the feeling of chaos, the second implicate order reveals the origin and resolution of the chaos. The author has seen this technique lead to the emergence of past memories in clients. The author emphasizes the power of entering into chaos and utilizing the bifurcation point in Gestalt therapy.",
  "content": "He continually says, \"I will be in Acaba, it is written in here\" (pointing to his head). He can see as the chaos shifts into the second implicate order which is outside of time to an event, which has already occurred in the future. Entering into the second implicate is like entering into a no-time space where future and past time can be viewed. This is the power of entering into chaos and the utilization of the bifurcation point. In Gestalt therapy, asking the client to exaggerate an experience and then to stay with the bifurcation point often leads to the second implicate order. For example, I have seen hundreds of clients, when asked to exaggerate and stay with their feelings, have memories emerge from the past. These memories are part of the chain of self-similarity and reveal the content of what occurred in the past. This is saying that by intensification and by exaggerating the feeling of chaos, the second implicate order reveals the origin, and hopefully the resolution of the chaos, or, better said, the order prior to the chaos.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, entering into chaos and utilizing the bifurcation point in therapy can lead to accessing the second implicate order, where past and future events can be viewed. By intensifying and exaggerating feelings, the origin and hopefully resolution of chaos can be revealed. In the psychology realm, energy refers to the transfer of substance from one person to another or a situation, highlighting the importance of effective communication and understanding in relationships."
