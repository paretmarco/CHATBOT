  "first_phrase": "In this part, we will discuss the \"General Magnetism Exercise\" which can be used for local magnetic treatment and activate holistic thinking. The exercise involves looking at a light or into the subject's eyes, grasping their thumb, and performing magnetic passes on the abdominal area while observing reactions. The author emphasizes the importance of intuitively moving hands where it is most needed and monitoring physiological changes of the subject. Previous tokens discussed the use of general magnetism techniques, the benefits of holistic thinking, and the importance of local magnetic treatment.",
  "content": "It is important also to look at the neck, the forefront, the hands where we can have changes in temperature. Rarely is sufficient to magnetise generally a person. It is better to work also locally. In a standing person could be also frequent a movement of the hands. This movement is more visible when we use strokes and we start from the head, we go on the arms and until the hands. When we stop here our hand, we will feel a small moving in the muscles, that sometimes can go on the whole forearm. This result is even more sure if we look our client in the eyes. These movements are of a nervous nature and sometimes can be linked to a resistance. In these cases it is better to put a flat hand on the front in the heartgrove and the other on the cerebellum. After we go sometimes down along the spine, and along the arms to the hands, and after sometimes you breath at his cerebellum or in your hand, going down along the tension.",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, when practicing self-magnetism or working on others, it is essential to pay attention to specific areas such as the neck, forefront, and hands. Working locally and observing nervous movements can yield more reliable results. Additionally, integrating magnetic water and sound can enhance proficiency and aid in reaching life goals."
