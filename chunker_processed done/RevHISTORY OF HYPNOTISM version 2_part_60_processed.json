  "content": "If you want to achieve the same powerful results obtained by the ancient magnetizers, it is helpful to get more into contact with Nature and its intuitive meaning. Do as Mesmer did. Try to get in touch with Nature’s feeling. To better perceive Nature’s feeling, don’t dwell too much in your mind and thinking. Spend time perceiving what really is. In our courses we stay often in Nature to achieve the right mindset Mesmer drew indeed greater benefit from Nature’s teaching than those he received from his schoolmaster. It has been related that, while still a child, he had a most gripping keenness to come to know the wellsprings of brooks, the course of which he would thus follow backwards until he succeeded in identifying their source: This is a pointer to his pronounced inclination towards researching causes, as well as the prelude to the discoveries he was destined to make. We can also see here that all the sciences that deal with intuition and inner senses are connected. If you want to get strong results you must develop your intuition. Each day, try to have intuition as your guide in what you do.",
