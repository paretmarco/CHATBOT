  "title": "The Power of Hypnosis: Real or Illusion?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author examines the controversial subject of hypnosis and mesmerismus. The author discusses how public exhibitions of hypnosis often increase interest in the subject, leading to an increase in the number of patients seeking treatment. The author also explores the relationship between the magnetic and the patient, emphasizing the deep connection and sense of empathy that is created. Additionally, the author argues that despite skepticism from some, the practice can induce healing and this has been recognized by even the most committed detractors. Overall, the author aims to provide a nuanced perspective on the topic that acknowledges both the benefits and criticisms of hypnosis and mesmerismus.",
  "content": "This is in fact one of the oddest phenomena. The sensibility which is engendered is such that one of the two individuals might be able to feel the sensations of the other. The existing feeling, however, resembles more the one which prevails between two female twins than anything else. It is thus no accident that studies have been carried out for the sake of understanding the resemblance with states which have been shown by observation to exist between twins. It is this feeling which ensures the materialization of the operator’s vitality and his desire to occasion wellbeing in his patient. Be it as it may, the connection is one between two unconscious sides, between two inward beings, and the inward being is more knowledgeable about what a person wants than the external, egotistic self. How is it possible to measure magnetism empirically? It cannot be doubted that instances of healing do occur. Even the most obstinate opponents of mesmerism in the past have never denied that significant improvements had been brought about through its practice. Jussieu himself, prior to the establishment of the first French commission on the subject, spoke of indisputable “tonic and salutary” effects.",
  "last_phrase": "While it is difficult to measure magnetism empirically, studies on the existence of human energy and its effects have shown indisputable improvements in wellbeing through mesmerism practice. The importance of this phenomenon lies in the connection between two unconscious sides, which produces a feeling reminiscent of the bond shared between female twins. Through the materialization of the operator's vitality and desire to create wellness in the patient, this inward connection proves more knowledgeable about a person's wants than their egotistic self. Thus, it is essential to explore this field of study further for practical applications in wellbeing."
