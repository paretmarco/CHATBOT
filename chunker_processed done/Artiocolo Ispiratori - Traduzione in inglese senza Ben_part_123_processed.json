  "content": "We would meet him either in his study or by a seafood restaurant which was not far from his house, and where he invariably offered to pay for our meals, even though we were always at least two visitors if not more. Add to it the fact that, whenever he went to the restaurant, he would hypnotize two or three persons in passing. He was in fact a munificent person who loved lavishing gifts on people. He gave us as present the book “Septenary of Higher Hypnosis”, which in those days was only meant to be read by a small elite. He had gifted some friends of his sharing an interest in esotericism certain talismans which amounted to real jewels cast in gold and precious stones. If he came across a beggar in the street, he would always hand him some generous sums of money. He was in fact possessed of ample means, which he had received from high calibre people who used to seek and frequent him in such a number that he was unable to see too many clients for his work.",
  "last_phrase": "Erminio's munificence was only surpassed by his mastery of hypnosis. He gifted books and talismans to his friends and helped the less fortunate generously. His techniques empowered him to remove pains and solve numerous problems in seconds, earning him a reputation even among doctors. Erminio truly had a golden heart and a golden touch."
