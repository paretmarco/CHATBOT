  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored how fear turns into anger in the observer/personality dyad, leading to a false sense of strength and the perception of being persecuted in order to compensate for the fear of inadequacy and the trauma of the loss of Essence. In the last part (200 tokens), we delve deeper into the psyche of the Devil's Advocate (Palmer) and understand how their fear of someone discovering their weakness makes them constantly paranoid. We also see how they turn their fear into anger and attack the imagined persecutor to hide their weakness, leading to the formation of a false sense of strength.",
  "content": "In this fixation, the fear is denied, and it quickly, unbeknownst to the individual, turns into anger to defend against anyone seeing the fear. This resistance to fear, and weakness being the underlying state. In other words the emptiness is labeled weakness. This causes an over-compensator I-dentity to form which is heroic and overly-strong and counter-phobic to compensate for the emptiness being labeled as weakness. This observer/personality dyad blames others for loss of Essence and attempts to find the truth by either proving authorities wrong or becoming an authority who knows the truth. Stated another way, in this style the observer/personality dyad defines the emptiness of Essence as a deep weakness. In order to compensate for this feeling of weakness, the #6 fixation of attention has a false ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 217 self of strength. To not show their fear or weakness to others or themselves they distract themselves imagining someone is persecuting them. To retaliate quickly, they turn their fear into anger and attack and persecute the imagined persecutor. The state of consciousness of a Devil's Advocate (Palmer) is a constant internal state of \"paranoia,\" the fear of someone finding out that they are empty and weak.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the #6 fixation of attention creates a false sense of strength to cover up the perceived weakness that comes from labeling emptiness as weakness. This leads to a constant state of internal paranoia and the fear of being exposed. It is important to recognize that all observer/personalities are inadequate compared to the Essence and it is not productive to compare oneself to it. Focusing on accepting and understanding one's true self can help avoid the negative thought patterns of this fixation."
