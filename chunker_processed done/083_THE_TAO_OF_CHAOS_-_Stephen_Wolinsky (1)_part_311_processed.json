  "title": "Healing Trauma Through Discharging Excess Energy",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discusses the dynamic system of energy in the context of resolving traumatic memories. This system involves recognizing patterns and releasing excess energy related to traumatic memories to create space for self-remembering. In this last part, the therapist and client engage in a conversation to explore the energy loop between a little boy and his cousin during an oral rape, which creates a cycle of humiliation and powerlessness. The therapy concludes with the client feeling more detached and reflecting on the exercise.",
  "content": "It is at this point the pattern is experienced, understood, and processed. The stored up energy is then discharged, and the pattern is released. Therapist: Okay. Create an energy loop from the cousin feeling powerful to the little boy feeling powerless and humiliated. Client: Okay. Therapist: What happens? Client: It disappears. Therapist: Okay. What fantasies does the little boy imagine the cousin is having? Client: Like he is going to kill him and cut his penis off and wear it around his neck to show off. Therapist: What fantasies does the little boy create in response? Client: Total humiliation...worse than death. Therapist: Create the cousin having those fantasies and the little boy having his fantasies in response as an energy loop. Client: Okay. Therapist: What happens? Client: It just keeps going. Therapist: How are you feeling about it? Client: More detached from it. Therapist: Okay. Let's let the movie roll and go on to the next segment, and describe what you see.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapist helps the client release stored up energy by creating energy loops and observing the little boy's responses to his cousin's fantasies. Through detachment and visualization, the client gains greater insight into their past experiences and can move forward with a better understanding of themselves."
