  "title": "\"Deep Hypnotic States: Applications and Historical Perspective\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous tokens, Dr. Esdaile's impressive accomplishments in mesmerism are discussed, including the successful treatment of a woman's illness and the painless amputation of a man's leg. This development in mesmerism occurred in France as well, with the Durvilles continuing the practice and merging it with polarities. However, some criticized this merging. In modern-day, biomagnetism has detached itself from classical hypnotic techniques. The following 200 tokens explore the usefulness of deep hypnotic states.",
  "content": "Dr. Esdaile's remarkable works are not the only records of capital operations performed without pain to the patient with the help of mesmerism. A paper read before the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, in 1842, and published as an independent pamphlet, gives full details concerning a case in which Mr. Ward, a surgeon attached to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, had, about that time, amputated a man's leg above the knee while he, the patient, remained completely unconscious of the operation in a mesmeric sleep, put upon him by the influence of Mr. Topham, a barrister interested in the practice of Mesmer. In France magnetism was developed further than in England. After Dupotet, the Durvilles (Hector, Gaston, Andr√©), continued this school and merged it with the findings of Reichenbach concerning polarities. This merging although interesting, was criticized by others34. In any case it continues until today such as in modern biomagnetism which has nevertheless detached itself even more from classical hypnotic techniques. What are deep hypnotic states useful for?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the history of mesmerism and hypnotism reveals fascinating accounts of painless surgeries and deeper states of consciousness. These states have been utilized for various purposes such as analgesia, accessing the implicate order, developing higher phenomena, and more. While modern biomagnetism has evolved from classical hypnotic techniques, there are still methods available for achieving deep states like hypnosleep and somnambulism. By exploring and understanding these techniques, practitioners can potentially unlock new avenues of healing and self-discovery."
