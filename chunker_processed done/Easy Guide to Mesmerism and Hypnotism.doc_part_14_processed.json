  "title": "Understanding the Differences between Hypnosis, Hypnotism and Mesmerism",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the fundamental differences between hypnosis, hypnotism, and mesmerism, providing a clear and scientific understanding of each. In the preceding text, we learned that the term \"hypnosis\" today is used to describe a state in which the critical factor is bypassed, while in the past, it referred to a state in which the entire conscious mind was bypassed. We also learned about the differences between hypnotism and mesmerism. In the final 200 tokens, the author explains what they mean by \"Modern Hypnosis\" and \"Mesmerism\" and how emotional and physiological changes play a role in inducing these states.",
  "content": "Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism means the conscious use of life fluid. We are researchers of the mind, and therefore we have searched to outline here the basic differences between “Modern hypnosis”, “Hypnotism” and “Mesmerism” in the most clear and scientific way possible. What we mean by “Modern Hypnosis” “Modern Hypnosis” is a form of “efficient communication.” Communication => emotional change => (physiological change) => different (altered) state of consciousness. This different state of consciousness allows us to operate change. It is not bound to a physiological shift. What is then this “Emotional Change” through the use of words? Each word suggests an image. These images are connected in the personal history of the person to specific emotions. Therefore the right words can bring about an emotional change. What we mean by “Mesmerism” Mesmerism is the state the operator induces and it is basically physiological. Action of the operator => physiological change => (emotional change) => different (altered) state of consciousness. In Mesmerism the “Emotional Change” is not a necessity. It is a consequence. In Mesmerism we create a physiological change.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the differences between modern hypnosis, mesmerism, and hypnotism can lead to a deeper understanding of the ways in which we communicate and induce altered states of consciousness. While modern hypnosis relies on emotional changes through words, mesmerism induces physiological changes without a focus on emotional shifts, and hypnotism remains distinct from both. Whether researching the mind or practicing techniques, knowing these differences can facilitate more effective methods for inducing altered states."
