  "first_phrase": "In the last section, we will learn about the symbolism behind the two essential symbols, the sun and fire, that help develop the right attitude and better results. Representing calmness, balance, radiance, energy, and vitality, these symbols remind us that vitality is not just about force, but about balance and energy. The text also teaches us how to develop vitality by starting from the body and its different parts.",
  "content": "FIRE This second symbol is the symbol of fire. This symbol represents energy and vitality. To get results we need to put vitality and energy. Both these two symbols are also symbols of LIGHT that will be an essential tool in our development. Personal Magnetism and Vitality Developing Magnetism is the same as developing vitality and the true nature of man. Vitality is not force. An elder person can have more vitality than a young person. Vitality is something starting from balance and represents a form of energy. To develop vitality we start from the body and its different parts. As the embryo develops, initially all cells are the same. But as development progresses, cells become specialized, and three layers develop, called endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. From the ectoderm originates the nervous system and the sensory organs, from mesoderm the digestive system, and from the endoderm the glandular system.",
  "last_phrase": "To truly develop personal magnetism and vitality, we must work on all three subsystems of our body: breathing and the nervous system, muscles and the digestive system, and glands and in particular the sex glands. By focusing on balance and energy, we can awaken our life force and develop our two hemispheres to become a truly vital and magnetic individual. Remember, the symbol of fire and the caduceus represent energy and the work we must do to become our best selves."
