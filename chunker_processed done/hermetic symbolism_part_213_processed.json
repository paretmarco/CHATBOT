  "title": "\"The Alchemical Process of Separation and Self-Transformation\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes a process of achieving a developed form of oneself through the separation of bodily consciousness and the attainment of an energy-based harmony. Basilio Valentino's viewpoint emphasizes the use of the universal solvent, also known as vitriol, to achieve this separation. The last part of the text explains that when one reaches the stage of being present to oneself and living in the now without distractions, they attain a higher power known as the rule. This process frees the spirit, which then becomes condensed and coagulated.",
  "content": "It is when we reach this stage that we are able to “separate the levels” (symbol +), by ensuring that we no longer confuse our self with our thoughts, our feelings, and our bodily sensations, whereupon we become eligible to attain a new form of ourselves that is less enslaved to mechanical impulses, and which can finally perceive reality in a clearer way. This way of operating allows us to create our different form of ourselves J, which is a developed form. In order to achieve that result, it is important for us to live in the now without falling into distractions 49. Separation necessitates to be present to our own selves and to the now, and might be symbolized by a hammer stroke which is the equivalent of the resolution to be PRESENT. If we are present to ourselves, we attain a higher power, the RULE (pure antinomy), which refers to the capacity of moving along a line that lies beyond the “red Adamic soil”, i.e. bodily consciousness. The process we have delineated up to now frees the spirit. The spirits thus freed gathers together, and becomes condensed and coagulated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by separating ourselves from our thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, we attain a higher level of consciousness that allows us to perceive reality in a clearer way. Staying present in the now and avoiding distractions is essential for this separation. This process frees the spirit and enables us to distill our finer selves into a quintessence. As hermetism suggests, distillation is a symbolic representation of achieving the purest essence of our being, the burning water or aqua vitae which is the ultimate goal."
