  "title": "\"The Miraculous Powers of Mesmerised Water\"",
  "first_phrase": "The incredible healing properties of mesmerised water are the focus of the last 200 tokens. The author shares several remarkable cases of patients who were cured of chronic constipation and peristaltic issues, solely through the use of mesmeric water. The author also shares how mesmerised water allows for the therapeutic organisation of the body, even in the absence of personal magnetisation or attendance. In addition, the author highlights the astonishing effects of magnetised mediums such as flannels, paper, and pillules. The text ends with a metaphor about the unseen influences we create on and about others, waiting to be revealed by the right circumstances.",
  "content": "The water in a short time will get into the circulation, and wherever there are nerves and arteries your curative life force will be carried on its healing mission. You will find similar astonishing results from the use of magnetised mediums such as flannels, paper, and pillules. Lay your hand upon a looking-glass for a few minutes then raise itâ€”you will find a vaporous impression of your hand upon the glass, which will die away from perceptible vision in a short time, so that no one would think or imagine your hand had ever been there. Breathe upon the looking-glass at any subsequent time, three days or a week afterwards (providing the glass has not been thoroughly cleaned in the meantime), and by that breathing the last impression of your hand will come to sight again, as though it had always been there. So it often happens that, unseen to mortal eyes or hidden from perceptible vision, or beyond scientific or medical detection, we are always laying our hands upon, and creating influences on and about our fellows, which only need the opportunity or right breathing to expose or reveal the past actions and thoughts so forgotten.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember that every action and intention you have towards others leaves an imprint, even if unnoticed by the human eye. Just as mesmerizing water carries a healing mission, we also have the power to influence those around us in positive ways. By focusing on tranquility and enabling our natural healing abilities, we can aid in the recovery of those in need."
