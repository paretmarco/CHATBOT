  "title": "\"The Price of Self-Deception and Judgment: A Revelation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author discusses how their self-deception led to a lack of ethics and caused them to accuse others. However, they soon realized that lying takes energy and creates boundaries that disconnect them from their essential connection to humanity. This realization led to feelings of vulnerability, compassion, and connection to others. In this final part, the author explores why people judge others and why they believe in differentism. They argue that judging others allows individuals to maintain their boundaries and remain separate as an individual self. The author believes that racism and sexism are only symptoms of deep fear and that the survival of the individual self is dependent on feeling different or special from others.",
  "content": "The myth that \"I would not do that\"...fill in the blank...is really more than a myth, it is a lie. Judgement and Boundaries Another reason we judge others is because it seems to be the only way we can remain separate as an individual self. We judge others or ourselves as bad or different not only because we don't want to be like another, or don't want to admit we are like another, but because it is the only way we can be different. We judge others as a way to stay separate and, hence, maintain our boundaries. I truly do not believe in racism or sexism. I believe that people judge anything that is different from them as bad so as to maintain individuality. Race, sex, and religious discrimination are only the symptoms of deep fear. In short, we judge others because there is a deep belief that if we didn't, we would merge, disappear, and never appear again. This can be a new view not of racism or sexism but what I call differentism. The individual self's survival is dependent on feeling special or different than others.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the reasons behind our tendency to judge and discriminate can help us work towards a more accepting and inclusive society. By acknowledging our own fears and insecurities, we can learn to appreciate and celebrate the differences that make us unique, rather than allowing them to drive us apart. Let us strive towards building more bridges and tearing down the walls that separate us."
