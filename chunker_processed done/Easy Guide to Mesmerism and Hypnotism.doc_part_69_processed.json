  "title": "The History of Spiritual Healing Practices in Hebrew Culture",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the use of hand apposition and blowing as means of healing that were used among the Hebrews and Assyrians. It also discusses the conveyance of spiritual powers and gifts through hand apposition. In the last 200 tokens, the text delves into the acceptance of soothsaying, trance, visions, and inspiration among the Hebrews and the seers or prophets who were consulted in private matters. The text also cites examples of wrong actions taken by some biblical figures concerning the practice. Nonetheless, it is never doubted in the sacred record that the prophecies and revelations of Jehovah through the prophets came to pass.",
  "content": "These, the curious can look up for themselves. The prophets of Israel, or seers, were consulted in private matters as well as the sacred things. In 1 Samuel (Chap. IX) you will find Saul, son of Kish, consulting Samuel the prophet (paying him a fee too) in order that he (Saul) might learn from the seer the whereabouts of his father's asses. Soothsaying, obsession, trance, visions, and inspiration were all accepted facts among these people. The evil and the good depended on the source. When Ahab, King of Israel, wished to know if he should be successful in war and take Ramoth in Gilead, he assembled his prophets to the number of four hundred. This was considered wrong,â€”as was also the action of Saul, seeking to know his ultimate destiny and that of his kingdom from the spirit of Samuel. Right or wrong, it is never doubted in the sacred record that Samuel did come back and what he predicted did take place. With the Hebrews, Jehovah not only spoke by prophet, revealed.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the prophets and seers of Israel were consulted for private and sacred matters. Soothsaying, trance, visions, and inspiration were accepted practices. While some actions were considered wrong, it was never doubted that God communicated through prophets, making His wishes known. Healing by the laying on of hands was also common. These practices show the power and influence of spirituality in ancient Israel, and may still be relevant to those seeking guidance and healing today."
