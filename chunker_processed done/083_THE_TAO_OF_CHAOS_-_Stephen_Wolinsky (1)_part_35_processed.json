  "title": "\"The Taboos of Energy Flow: Chaos and Resistance\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the concept of energy flow between individuals and the taboos surrounding it. In the previous section, the author discusses how humans often block or dissipate energy from another person, causing chaos in their system. In the final 200 words, the author delves deeper into why we resist this energy flow and what opportunities we might be denying ourselves by doing so. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and acknowledging the flow of energy in our interpersonal relationships.",
  "content": "All these are attempts to organize the flow of energy from one individual system into another. At an individual level, when energy is in the form of another person, and enters into your system, momentarily your system feels chaotic. To resist this chaos the system attempts to organize or order the chaos through blocking it out, tightening muscles and dissipating it. In short, the system, i.e. you, resists the extra energy of another person by organizing what their behavior means, or solidifying the natural flow of the energy of one person adding energy into your system. It is in the energy flow that chaos is experienced, and the resistance to this extra energy by us denies us a deeper order which might become available. Why we do this will be described later, for now however, suffice it to say that as energy moves from self-to-self or selfto-other, the energy disrupts the stable system making the person feel a little uneasy, crazy, out of control, or chaotic.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by embracing the chaos that arises from the flow of energy from one individual system to another, we can access a deeper order that may be beneficial for our growth and development, instead of resisting it and creating a separate universe that leads to pain, loneliness, and isolation."
