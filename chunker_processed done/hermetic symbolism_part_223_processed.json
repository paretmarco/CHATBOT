  "title": "\"The Three Levels of Hermetic Initiation: Achieving Quantum Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author delves into the world of possibles, explaining how the nature of the universe itself is constantly changing and interconnected. They assert that to grasp the true quantum nature of reality, the observer must be reawakened, and the dyad of observer-observed must fuse. The text focuses on hermeticism and the three levels of hermetic initiation, namely purifying the salt, marrying opposites, and becoming one with the light. Through these steps, one can achieve a higher state of being and a true understanding of the universe's quantum nature.",
  "content": "We must put away what Wirth defines “the stabilised structure of the personality”. And as we proceed we can understand that the two lights are in reality one light, in the same way as the light of the moon is the same as the light of the sun. At this point we can bring together these two opposites and achieve a superior state, that we can understand the true quantum nature of the universe. The three levels of the hermetic initiation In hermeticism to do it we must first purify the salt. It means we must learn to be present, and not staying trapped in our thoughts. So the salt becomes transparent. Also we need to develop energy, vitality. Otherwise we risk to “sleep”. This is the goal of the first step of the hermetic initiation. The second step is marrying these two opposites in everyday’s life. Arriving to a superior level where there is no more an observer – observed diad. The third level is becoming one with the light (fixation of the sulphur). Light has always been used from the most ancient times as a tool for getting to higher states of being.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by purifying our thoughts, developing our energy and ultimately becoming one with the light, we can achieve a superior state of being and understand the true quantum nature of the universe. By using light as a tool, we can bypass the concepts of time and space and create our own reality. These are powerful practices that can lead to a more enhanced state of being."
