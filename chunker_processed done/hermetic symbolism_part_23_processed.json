  "title": "\"The Primordial Substance: Understanding the Etheric Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the concept of the Primordial substance was explored in the form of Tiamath, the wife of Apsu, the god of the shapeless shadows. In this final part, Dom Antoine Joseph Pernéty's understanding of alum as the origin of all salts, minerals, and metals is discussed. Alum, despite its commonly known properties, is thought to be the philosophical salt par excellence, symbolizing The One or the fundamental substance. The ancient code of \"en to pan\" or The Creative Light is also mentioned, highlighting the need for substance in creation.",
  "content": "A philosophical salt par excellence, this is the origin of all other Salts, minerals and metals, according to the definition by Dom Antoine Joseph Pernéty, in his Dictionnaire mytho-hermétique.5 None of the properties of alum as it is commonly known would justify this pre-eminence. It would appear that some word-play also took place, because Alum evokes The One, the fundamental substance, and is analogous with Ether which represents the innermost essence of things, a subtle connection with no real differentiation. In other words it is the substrate, which in a sense is immaterial, of all material aspects. In all cosmogony there is the primitive Chaos, in which everything with distinctive form and qualities is mixed up, smothered and stifled by homogeneity. It is Tiamath, before the furore that suddenly disturbs her clarity by way of condensation, and transforms the wife of Apsu into dense, salty water, from whence all creation will spring forth. Editor’s note. The ancient code reporting the words “en to pan” The Creative Light To create means to bring forth from nothing. But in order for beings and things to be brought forth from this supposed Nothing, it needs to have some sort of substance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the primitive Chaos and the essence of things are intricately linked. The substance that fills the infinite space is the substrate of all material aspects and the essence of all life. The vibrations within this homogeneous medium are responsible for all creation, demonstrating the infinite dynamism of the universe."
