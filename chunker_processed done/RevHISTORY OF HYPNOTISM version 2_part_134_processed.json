  "title": "\"The Discovery of Somnambulism and Magnetic Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, Puysegur's use of magnetism to induce a tranquil sleep and alleviate a patient's suffering is highlighted. He urged on the crisis and made the patient dance mentally, forcing him to move and sweat profusely. The patient's health improves considerably after being given crises and consuming food. Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism is discussed, as Mesmer had already known about it but rarely used it.",
  "content": "A drink was now given to him, and having ordered some bread and broth to be brought to him, I made him eat a considerable quantity on that same evening, which is something he had not been able to do for the last five days. He slept that entire night; and the next day, not remembering my visit of the previous evening, he informed me of the improved state of his health. I gave him two crises: Wednesday and Thursday I had the satisfaction of seeing him affected merely with a slight shivering. Every day I had the patient's feet put into water for the space of three hours, and gave him two crises a day. Today (Saturday) the shivering lasted less time than usual, his appetite was kept up, he enjoyed a good night's rest; lastly, I had the satisfaction of seeing him perceptibly better, and I expect that in the next three days he will resume his usual employments, etc.\" 74 Puysegur was discovering somnambulism. Mesmer already knew about it, but rarely applied it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism and the idea of being in contact with nature during magnetic sleep was groundbreaking. His method of magnetizing patients and using crises to improve their health was effective and showed promising results. With further research, we can continue to explore the possibilities and benefits of this approach to healing."
