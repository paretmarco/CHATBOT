  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the fallacy of change was explained, which is a thinking distortion that motivates people to lie to themselves about their relationships in order to fill the emptiness they feel. The father of cognitive therapy, Albert Ellis, called this \"musturbation.\" In this last 200 tokens, a sample conversation between a therapist and a client is given, where the client expresses feeling a gnawing emptiness that drives them to work late. The therapist inquires about the physical location of the emptiness in the body.",
  "content": "(Thoughts and Feelings: The Act of Cognitive Stress Intervention, McKay, Davis, Fanning, New Harbinger, 1981, p. 23) Furthermore, Albert Ellis, the father of Cognitive Therapy would say that in our example she had a thought that Bill \"must not\" be the way he was. This \"must not\" Ellis calls \"musturbation;\" the continual thought that this must not be allowed or must not be true. Individuals seeking relationships are often attempting to get another to fill up their emptiness. In short, if I imagine you can fill up my emptiness—\"I love you;\" when I realize you can't—\"I'm out of here\"—in search of someone who can. Therapist: When you go home at night after work, do you feel a gnawing emptiness inside that you just can't stand? Client: It drives me crazy. I just don't want to go home at night so I'll work late every night. Therapeutic Note Here again, the emptiness jumps out as a gnawing real pain. Therapist: Where do you feel the emptiness in your body? Client: Here.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, cognitive therapy recognizes the tendency to \"musturbate\" and seek fulfillment from external sources, such as relationships. However, therapeutic interventions, such as exploring and facing the emptiness within, can lead to greater self-awareness and improved mental health."
