  "title": "\"The Power of Light: From Apollonius of Tyana to Modern Practices\"",
  "first_phrase": "Apollonius of Tyana, a philosopher born in Cappadocia around 4 BC, believed that the sun was a divine entity and attributed his wisdom and spiritual power to it. He frequently prayed to the sun and practiced sun gazing, an ancient technique of deriving energy from the sun. In this last part, Dr. Lefebvre's research on the power of light to increase psychic gifts is discussed, cautioning against direct eye contact with the sun. The text recommends using artificial light for similar stimulation.",
  "content": "Looking at light Sun gazing is the ancient practice of deriving nutritional energy directly from the sun simply by gazing intently at it within an hour of sunrise or sunset. Objectives vary from person to person but most sun gazers seek better mental and physical health along with a higher level of spiritual awareness. Use of artificial light Following the researches of Dr. Lefebvre we also recognize the incredible power of light in increasing psychic gifts. But we don't advise to look at the sun as his light is to strong. In our school we utilize light to create the same type of stimulation, and we recommend using artificial light in order to avoid eye damages.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while sun gazing can have potential benefits, we do not recommend staring directly at the sun due to the risk of eye damage. Instead, utilizing artificial light can provide similar cerebral stimulation without the potential harm. Understanding the physics of light and utilizing it in a safe and controlled way can have positive effects on mental and physical health."
