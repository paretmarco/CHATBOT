  "title": "\"Discovering the Link Between Presence, Magnetic Force, and Success\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the connection between physical and spiritual health. The first part discusses how examining the body and medicinal substances can stimulate the soul, leading to detailed anatomical descriptions. This had a profound impact on Schopenhauer and Naturphilosophie, influencing Bohr and Schroedinger, and eventually leading to quantum theory. The last 200 tokens delve into the research conducted by AFEM on magnetic factors and psychokinetic action, which revealed that successful people often exhibit strong effects. This groundbreaking research has been cited in various books and opens up new therapeutic and research dynamics.",
  "content": "Further researches about mystery: Presence and success AFEM pushed forward with a number of researches in the course of the last century. When it comes to its reports, we find an interesting range of examinations of magnetic factors. Special relevance is attached to an array of experiments which have been conducted on the topic of psychokinetic action. The said experiments provide in their conclusive results some keys which one can use to achieve success as well. These researches have enjoyed vast resonance, so far-reaching indeed that that they were even quoted by Dr. Lefbure in one of his books. They consisted in experiments carried out under the monitoring eye of a sizeable number of contemporary university professors. Here under we reproduce some of the salient points from a conversation held with Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli “The eventual outcome consists in the fact that, oftentimes, those persons who show the strongest effects are people who, in their lives, have indeed attained a substantial degree of success, as managers, chairmen and directors”.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve success, it is crucial to understand the connection between the well-known \"magnetic force\" and psychokinetic action. The researches conducted by AFEM have provided keys that can be used to achieve success in life, and Count Jean Pierre clarifies that a state of presence is crucial. Therefore, learning to be present is essential to attract good fortune in one's life."
