  "title": "\"Phreno-mesmeric Experiment: Creating Illusions in Subjects' Minds\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explains a technique to induce mesmeric state in subjects with rapid downward passes at a distance, and then bring them to the somnambulistic or mesmeric stage. Once enough subjects are in this state, the author suggests performing various experiments, such as creating illusions in their minds. In the last 200 tokens, the author proposes an experiment where the subjects are led to an imaginary garden and observe their reactions. Some will greedily eat, others will appreciate the beauty, but when a cluster of bees appears, the response is unpredictable. The experiment shows the effects of the subjects' temperaments and characters under different situations.",
  "content": "Such an experiment as the following is interesting. Lead all your subjects into a garden (an imaginary one). Let them behold its beauties, enjoy its fruits, and gather its flowers. Give them all freedom of action and speech therein. Some will manifest greed and selfishness; others will be generous curteous, and kindly to a fault; some will eat greedly and see little of the picturesque in their surroundings. To others it will be a veritable garden of delight—the tint of the flower, the combination of foliage, there, the fore-ground here, the back-ground there, the blending lights and shades, and the perspective, the tout ensemble is to them a thing of beauty and a joy for ever. All according to their temperament and character, walk through and enjoy the living dream— for dream it is and nothing more. Discover a cluster of bees warming in some corner of the garden. Let me one, thoughtlessly or greedily searching for fruit, disturb the bees. The change of scene is magical. Some will desperately fight the bees; others will manifest rage; some will sit dawn and try to cover themselves from attack, while others will cry like children.",
  "last_phrase": "In this experiment, subjects experience a dream-like state where their natural faculties have full play. By observing their behaviors in the garden and cemetery, we can gain insight into their true temperament and character. This exercise can be a useful tool for self-reflection and personal growth as it highlights strengths and weaknesses in a safe and controlled environment."
