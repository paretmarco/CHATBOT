  "title": "\"Developing Hypnotic Abilities: Three Exercises for Better Health and Presence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, it was emphasized that training and effort are indispensable for achieving success in developing hypnotic abilities. Now, the author proceeds to share three exercises that not only enhance magnetic gaze and positive speaking but also benefit one's health. The exercises include staring intensely without blinking in a half-lit room, reading aloud while stressing every syllable properly, and practicing suggestive formulas in front of a mirror. By performing these activities diligently, individuals can gain self-confidence and influence others' minds powerfully.",
  "content": "NB: You will accomplish your goal more rapidly if, when you read or write, you refrain from beating your eyelids. 2. Every day you must read a few pages, speaking slowly as you do so and getting accustomed to stress every syllable gravely, without however straining your voice. You should remind yourselves that an exact, energetic, firm and resolute word which is uttered properly produces very strong reactions in other people’s minds. 3. When you are alone, place yourself in front of a mirror which is able to reflect the image of your whole person. At that stage, verbalize a suggestive formula (e.g. : ‘Look at me in the eyes ...’). Imagine yourself in front of a subject, and accompany what you say by gestures. Try out several possible formulas, so that you are finally able to choose the one suiting you the most. Repeat this exercise many times, scrupulously and attentively, until you experience the sensation your action would have to produce on the subject.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises to improve your verbal communication skills and developing a strong presence can have a powerful impact on how others perceive you. By following a daily routine and committing to ongoing training, you can master the art of communication and achieve your goals with greater ease and confidence. Remember, it takes practice, patience, and a disciplined approach to truly harness the power of your words and presence."
