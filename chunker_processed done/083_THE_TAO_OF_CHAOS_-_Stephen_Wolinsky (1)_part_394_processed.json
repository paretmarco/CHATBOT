  "title": "\"Self-Organization in Human Growth and Improvement\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the work of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, who developed a methodology for human growth and improvement based on kinesthetic self-awareness. He notes that basic human capabilities are self-organized through the activity of the person, and the best way to evoke the self-organizing abilities of the nervous system is through awareness and movement. In the final 200 tokens, he introduces three scientific revolutions that shed light on self-organization: Systems biology and cybernetics, the study of systems far from equilibrium thermodynamically, and the study of complex systems near the edge of chaos. He explains that all these approaches share the recognition that feeding back the system output into the system results in emerging patterns of quasi-stable structure.",
  "content": "The first, and closest to the views I have expressed, stems from systems biology and cybernetics and is most cogently developed in the work of the Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. The second is based on what happens to systems at conditions far from equilibrium and the study of such systems thermodynamically. Nobel prize winner, Ilya Prigogine, has been instrumental in this area. The third stream comes from the study of complex systems at the edge of chaos, and what happens when iteration is present in the system. Collectively the work of the Santa Fe institute has been most significant here with regard to living systems. We now come to the common feature of all these approaches. And that is the discovery that in a system where the output of the system is fed back into the system, an emerging order or pattern appears as a consequence in the form of some sort of quasi stable structure. The process of feeding back something into the system repeatedly is called iteration in chaos theory. With regard to the nervous system, Gerald Edelman uses the term reentrant signalling. Maturana and Varela speak of recursion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the emergence of quasi stable structures resulting from iterative processes in complex systems is a novel discovery that has expanded our understanding of nonlinear systems. This discovery has far-reaching implications for various sciences, including systems biology and cybernetics, thermodynamics, and the study of complex living systems, and highlights the significance of feedback mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems."
