  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored Magnetism and its amazing ability to restore balance to the body. It is a natural and non-invasive method that can heal sickness and problems that traditional medicine cannot solve. In this final part, we learn about the connection between Mesmeric techniques and the Universe. We discover how reconnecting to a higher universal dimension is the basis of health and harmony. The text also offers practical suggestions for cultivating harmony within ourselves. Let's explore some incredible examples of F.A. Mesmer's healing, including a woman who had been blind for years, and how he helped her regain her sight.",
  "content": "We must strive to balance ourselves and to be in harmony with Nature. ( Any suggested methods here ? ) .. Imagine that a very dis-connected reader asks .. ‘how do I do that ?’ *** Remarkable points of the original Mesmeric technique. Non verbal It is completely natural Most of the sicknesses and problems it heals are problems that even today traditional medicine cannot solve Extremely successful and pleasant for the subject Its principles are not linear, but more similar to quantum thinking Some examples of Mesmer’s healings Here are some healings of F. A. Mesmer \"When I presented the said *** to M. Mesmer ... her left eye was profoundly sunk into his socket, and probably softened. The right eye ... was covered with a thick grey film, so that this lady was absolutely blind.\" Mesmer said that he could do nothing for the left eye. But after four or five weeks of treatment, the film had gone from the right eye, the eye had been brought back into position, and the patient could see very well\" 47 Giraud, a physician of Turin, describes many cases of Mesmer’s healing.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve balance and harmony with nature, various methods can be adopted, such as spending time in nature, practicing mindfulness and meditation, reducing consumption and waste, and adopting a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Mesmerism, an ancient healing technique based on non-verbal, natural, and quantum principles, can also serve as a complement to traditional medicine in treating various illnesses that medicine cannot solve. Mesmer's success stories, which include curing blindness and hemiplegia, are a testimony to the effectiveness of this approach, underscoring the importance of exploring alternative healing methods to achieve physical, mental, and spiritual wellness."
