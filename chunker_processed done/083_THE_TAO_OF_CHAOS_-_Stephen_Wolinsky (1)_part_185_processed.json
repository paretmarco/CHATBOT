  "title": "\"The Importance of Uncovering Lies and Embracing Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author delves into the process of uncovering our own lies and seeing people for who they truly are. They discuss how denial can prevent the reabsorption of our I-dentities back into Essence, which is the essence of the real self. The author also mentions a conversation between a student and Nisargadatta Maharaj regarding beingness. The text emphasizes the importance of looking at all I-dentity structures as one's own and moving inward towards Essence. Additionally, the author reflects on the therapy of chaos and how it can help us move towards a state of Quantum Consciousness. Understanding the difference between personality and Essence is crucial in this process.",
  "content": "Because no personality is one structure, rather we are mixes of many, and the enneagram, like the Quantum universe, is in constant motion. OUTER CHAOS: THE DISRUPTER INNER CHAOS: THE ESSENCE OF THE REAL SELF LI61ORGANIZER l■ 0hroughout the book we have talked Oto chaos as organizers of personality and about \"outer\" chaos and the resistance I-dentities. The therapy of chaos moves us in- ward to Essence, which is prior to personality. gigPersonality, it might be said, has limitations ILLI due to the fact that it is in time, or began as an individual as the physical body was conceived, born, and developed. Essence, however, has much greater scope and is prior to personality, • and thus is one step closer to Quantum Consciousness than is personality. For this reason, Essence has at its fingertips essential qualities which personality is seeking. Stated another way, Essence has access to all qualities and is all qualities. Personality, according to noted Sufi teacher, G.I. Gurdjieff, is what is acquired; Essence is what we come with. Simply stated, we can say that the most intense trauma that occurs is as the personality is formed and leaves Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, understanding the concept of chaos and its role in shaping our personalities can lead us towards our Essence, which has greater scope and access to essential qualities compared to personality. By acknowledging and seeking our Essence, we can heal the trauma of our personality's departure from it and live a more fulfilling life closer to Quantum Consciousness."
