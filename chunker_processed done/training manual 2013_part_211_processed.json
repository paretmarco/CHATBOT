  "title": "\"The Power of the Look: Its Utilization in Hypnotic Influence and Personal Growth\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author explores the potential uses of the hypnotic technique involving the power of the look. Despite the fact that modern-day hypnotists are unable to effectively utilize this technique, the author believes that the look can prove to be a valuable asset in the field of hypnotic influence. The author provides two methods of utilizing the hypnotic power of the look. The first is in everyday life and relationships, where the look can be used to seduce, attract, and enchant others. The second is within the therapeutic field, where the look has been traditionally attributed with healing powers. The author cites Erminio from Pisa, who was able to heal various disorders through the power of the look. The author theorizes that the power of the look smashes deeply engrained fixed ideas, allowing for a more open mind.",
  "content": "Both Hippocrates 49 and Dioscorides 50, as well as Theophrastus 51, forcefully maintain that healing power could be exercised through the look, gestures and specific rituals. Our own master Erminio from Pisa 52, therefore, perpetuated such tradition by causing the instant healing of pains of the muscles and the skeleton, tinnitus, and several other disorders. A theory that might provide justification for such results is the one set out here under: The mind is sometimes caught in the grips of what is usually referred to as «fixed ideas». We keep on thinking the same things, and we let ourselves be constantly chased by the phantom of old thoughts and go round and round the same set of concepts. The charming attraction of the look, therefore, smashes such deeply engrained ideas. It is as if through the means of fascination, moreover, we succeeded in “entering the other person”. Every person’s world is fenced off by a limiting boundary consisting in the narrow space of what his sight encompasses and reaches up to.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of healing through the look, gestures, and specific rituals has been documented by many historical figures, and this tradition continues to this day. By breaking through our fixed ideas and entering into the interpersonal reality of others, we can aid in their healing from within. Additionally, exercises aimed at strengthening the eye can also lead to personal growth and a stronger, more magnetic personality. So, let us be mindful of the power of our gaze and use it for both healing and personal development."
