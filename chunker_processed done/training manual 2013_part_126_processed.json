  "title": "The Concept of Time and its Impact on Human Consciousness",
  "first_phrase": "This passage explores the relationship between time, thinking, and self-consciousness. It discusses the Hopi and Navaho peoples' experience of time as an \"eternal present\" and distinguishes \"monochronic\" and \"polychronic\" time. Author Ken Wilber links the development of linear time to self-consciousness and the ego, while philosopher Eric Neumann explains that history requires reflecting consciousness. While linear time can offer some advantages, it can also bind us to our past experiences and beliefs and alienate us from the present reality of our lives.",
  "content": "The linear time is produced by the thinking. As the philosopher Eric Neumann wrote \"so long as a perceiving ego consciousness is lacking there can be no history. In order to exist history requires a \"reflecting\" consciousness, and it is the act of reflecting that constitutes it. However, linear time can bring advantages and problems. In effect, the more we believe in the linearity of time thinking of living in its linearity by programming our mind, the more we keep on living in our ego. As consequence, we are bound to all our past experiences and beliefs2. As regards emotions they are the product of time's experience. Nevertheless, also a linear time can alienate us from the present and from the reality of our lives.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, linear time can bring advantages and problems to our lives. While reflecting on our past experiences is important for personal growth, constantly living in the past or future can lead to alienation from the present moment. To truly live, we must learn to appreciate the only time that truly belongs to us - the now."
