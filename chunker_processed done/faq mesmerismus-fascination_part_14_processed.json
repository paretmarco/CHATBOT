  "first_phrase": "The final section of this text delves into the practical application and proof of the magnetic energy used in mesmerism. Using hand passes and hypnotic gaze, practitioners use animal magnetism to establish a connection between themselves and their subjects. While there is no tangible proof of magnetic fluid, the concept is useful in the practitioner's belief system. Those interested in learning more about mesmerism can find a variety of books and resources online. Also, the text asks whether disease is the result of a blockage of a metaphor or an idea, following Dr. Paret's belief that diseases are caused by a blockage of energy.",
