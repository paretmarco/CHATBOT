  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Dr. Esdaile extols the virtues of Mesmerism, a type of hypnosis, in various aspects of medical treatment. He urges fellow practitioners to use Mesmerism to lessen pain during surgery and improve patient recovery. He further suggests that Mesmerism can be an effective treatment method in general medicine and even insanity. In the final 200 tokens, Esdaile cites Dr. Kean, who claims that Mesmerism cured the majority of his epilepsy patients. Esdaile believes that Mesmerism has powerful curative properties and warrants further exploration in medical practice.",
  "content": "Again:- \"A vital agent which is capable of reducing a living man temporarily to the insensibility of a corpse, and without subsequent injury to the system, it is evident that such an influence possesses the essential conditions of a curative agent in the highest degree-the power of safety in its application.\" Its benefit in therapeutics \"It appears that Mesmerism is likely to be as serviceable in the treatment of insanity as it is in general medicine and the practice of surgery. Dr. Kean, writing to me, says, 'Taking a hasty glance over the years 1847 and '48, I see that seventy-four patients were mesmerised, and that of these sixtyfour were discharged cured to all appearance, and I think it has been successful in every case of epilepsy.' \"â€”Dr. Esdaile.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism has proven to be a powerful and safe curative agent that has shown promising results in the treatment of various medical conditions, including epilepsy and chronic inflammation. Its ability to instantly alleviate pain, arrest convulsions, and aid natural resolution of inflammation makes it a useful discutient while local Mesmerism can gently stimulate nerves and capillary vessels of diseased parts to more healthy action. Mesmerism is potentially an efficient direct nervous remedy for functional derangements of the nervous system, which is a significant breakthrough in medicine."
