  "title": "The Power of Presence: A Path to Human Happiness",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between human happiness and the state of presence, or “quintessence.” The author highlights the importance of presence in discovering deep powers and how this state is useful in magnetism. The problem of human happiness is linked to our specific temperament and the way in which our organism receives sensations, which is in turn connected to the mind-body connection. The text proposes two paths to address this issue: changing one's temperament or learning how to disconnect the mind-body union. The main cure recommended is the ability to live in the now, which enables a person to balance themselves and erect a barrier against negative thoughts. The center of the wheel represents the essence of man, the present moment.",
  "content": "Learning how to disconnect the mind-body union which ensures that a given temperament reflects itself on the body (being a process which is also called “separation of the levels”)90 What is entailed by the former situation is to operate on the temperament by acting upon our body both through suitable physical therapies and through direct intervention in the spirit via a psychological re-education. The main cure we recommend, however, is a different one. The man who is hardly ever unhappy possesses the power to summon up, as a help he can draw from in every situation, the qualities that characterize other temperaments as well, the power, that is, to balance up his own self and, at the same time, erect a barrier against thoughts which happen to be either useless or of indifferent value. The said barrier consists in the ability to live in the now. The center of the wheel ? is in fact the place where the elements touch each other. It is likewise the central point which corresponds to the essence of man: The present moment.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve a balanced mind and body, it is crucial to disconnect these levels through physical therapies and psychological re-education. However, the most effective cure lies in summoning the power to live in the present moment and finding a balance within ourselves. A powerful method is to vivify symbols such as fire and heat, which can help to transcend various temperaments and overcome emotional and bodily blocks. Start by paying attention to the heat of your body and connect it with light to fully potentiate the exercise."
