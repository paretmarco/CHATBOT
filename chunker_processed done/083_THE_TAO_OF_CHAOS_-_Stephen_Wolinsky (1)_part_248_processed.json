  "title": "\"Exploring Relationship Dynamics in Object Relations Therapy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a transcript of a therapy session. The therapist is exploring how the client deals with the pain of not having sexual contact with her partner. The therapist notices that the client is substituting a platonic relationship for a sexual one and treating her partner as an object, neglecting his pain. The therapist explores how the client's relationship with her parents may have influenced her current behavior, and how she may be controlling her partner through sex. The last part (200 tokens) discusses a masochist/sadist dyad, in which the client is in pain and gives herself more pain by staying in a relationship that is not what she wants, while also controlling her partner by withholding sex.",
  "content": "Next, I would explore how she fused that model and is acting it out in present time with Carl. Therapist: Do you lead him on? Client: No. Therapist: Well, don't you think by living with a man that sex is usually involved? 200 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS Client: Yes, but I tell him I don't feel the same way as he does. Therapist: Notice the double message you are giving him; you live with him and give him and others the idea that you are sexual, when you are not. Client: Yes, he feels angry like I'm controlling him through sex. Therapeutic Note Here the masochist/sadist dyad is revealed. First, she is in pain about no intimacy, and hence gives herself pain staying in a relationship that is not sexually what she wants. Second, she controls Carl by withholding sex and gives him and others the message that they are or will someday be lovers. Therapist: What are you feeling right now? Client: Pain in my heart. Therapist: How do you defend against the pain in your heart? Client: By acting like everything is okay with Carl. Therapist: And controlling him?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this therapy session revealed how the masochist/sadist dyad can manifest in a relationship, where one person is in pain and controls the other through withholding intimacy. The therapist encouraged the client to feel and address the underlying emotions of despair and emptiness, which may help to break this pattern and move towards a healthier and more fulfilled life."
