  "title": "Mesmerism: Inducing Trance State and Transfusing Vital Energy.",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author vividly described James Esdaile's mesmerizing experiments on patients in India. Esdaile claimed that he could transfer his nervous energy to patients and create local determinations of their energy as he desired. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the author talks about how Esdaile, like many other magnetisers of his time, believed in the electrical explanation of the phenomena. He suggested that our organs have a continual electro-magnetic action, just like two different substances cannot meet without producing electricity. Furthermore, he believed that men can possess a modification of the same power as the electric fish.",
  "content": "He said:- \"In the actual state of science, we are entitled to say that a continual electro-magnetic action is going on in our organs by the contact of the arterial blood with its containing tissues-by its transfusion into venous blood which returns again to the lungs to combine with the oxygen of the air. We know that two different substances cannot come into contact without electricity being evolved, and that all chemical actions, whether analysis or synthesis, set at liberty a certain portion of electric fluid. If the electric fish can secrete electricity, and project it in the direction desired by its will, why should not men possess a modification of the same power? \"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the debate over whether or not mesmerism is a legitimate physical power or merely a product of imagination and fascination remains unresolved. However, the evidence presented by the mesmeric committee, including the continual electromagnetic action in the human body, supports further exploration into the potential for individuals to possess a modification of the same power as electric fish. Regardless of the method used, it is clear that the mesmeric influence has the potential to produce significant physical effects that warrant further investigation."
