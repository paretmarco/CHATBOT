  "title": "The Vital Force: Rediscovering the Basic State of Man.",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the focus is on the concept of the Life Force and the primal state of man. The Life Force is the universal fluid or force that permeates everything in the universe and guides our bodies in restoring themselves. The Fourth Rule in Magnetism states that vital force is the basis of physical qualifications, with good health and a peculiar power being the two key elements. Deleuze asserts that the first step towards recognizing this peculiar power is by acknowledging its existence and the degree of energy in ourselves. Going into hypnosis, doing magic, or practicing meditation is like going back to the true reality of man. By acceding to the basic state of man, one can naturally heal oneself, become stronger and happier, and have a natural harmonic perception of the world, as well as some psychic gifts.",
  "content": "Hence going in hypnosis, doing magic, meditation etc... are all \"going back\" to the true reality of man? Why we shouldn't normally increase our force at will, feel anaesthesia when needed and go normally in the direction of well being? Often for people to respond to hypnotic suggestion there must already be the possibility in our mind somewhere. And if this possibility is there is because that is ours. What we call \"response to a suggestion\", is the \"normal answer\" a person in this basic state will give to an affirmation as in this state there is no split between mind and body. So a person acceding to his basic state can heal himself naturally, because it is normally for the organism to heal itself. A person acceding to his basic state will be stronger and happier than a person outside the basic state. A person in his basic state will have also a natural harmonic perception of the world and some psychic gifts as the party etc... will be spontaneously manifested.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, accessing our basic state through practices such as hypnosis and meditation can lead to natural healing, increased strength and happiness, as well as a harmonious perception of the world. By recovering energy otherwise consumed by the ego, we can manifest a more open and present-centered awareness that allows us to thrive and live a fulfilling life. So why not make it a habit to regularly tap into our basic state for a more vibrant and healthier existence?"
