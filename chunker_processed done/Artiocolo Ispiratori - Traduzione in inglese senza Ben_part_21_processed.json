  "title": "\"The Power of Magnetic Gaze: Taming Animals and Exploring Distance Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the incredible power of magnetism, as demonstrated by the magnetist Henri Durville. In the previous section, the audience watches in awe as Durville uses his magnetic energy to calm two ferocious lions, which were staging a mutiny against their owner. The text goes on to describe how anyone can develop their own magnetism through exercises like gazing into their third eye without blinking, and even taming animals with their gaze. The final section describes another of Durville's impressive demonstrations, in which he magnetizes a person behind a wall - a phenomenon known as \"distance magnetism\". Though difficult to explain, this experiment has been replicated with striking effects in many trainings.",
  "content": "This is a very good esercise also to develop your personal magnetism. After you would have made your gaze stronger, try looking at a dog, or at a cat. You will find that these animals will react to the gaze and you will able to tame them. If you have a very small dog, put it in on your lap. Look into his eyes steadily and at the same time caress his eyebrowns. You will soon see he will close his eyes. Another demonstration which Henri Durville used to conduct was to magnetize a person behind a wall. This is an experiment which, provided it is carried out with the required calm and attention, is always regaled with a far-reaching effect. It does in fact enable one to understand the dynamic which is termed “distance magnetism”. We have replicated it many times in our trainings, most of the time with striking effects. It is obviously difficult to explain why such a fact actually occurs.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing the exercise of developing your personal magnetism can have impressive results, such as taming animals and demonstrating distance magnetism. The collaboration between Henri Durville and Master Philippe from Lyon, two exceptional magnetists, showcases the incredible power of this practice in healing and beyond."
