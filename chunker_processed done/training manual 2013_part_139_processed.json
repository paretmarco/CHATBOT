  "first_phrase": "The final section of this text focuses on practical exercises to develop central energy and enhance magnetism. The section begins by stating that Tantra in India and the Egyptian path also use similar ancient methods. However, the author suggests that for healing purposes, the previously demonstrated procedures are sufficient. The exercises mentioned include using a mirror to improve self-magnetism and enhance gaze, and a simpler version of the first awakening of the hermetic caduceus exercise of the Egyptian school to develop inner fire (kundalini). By performing these exercises, one can achieve a new state of mind and balance with the elements.",
  "content": "Exercise n. 5a – in front of a mirror In front of the mirror fix on a point between the two eyes (the so-called third eye) without closing your eyelids (the goal is to reach a more “fluid” consciousness state): at this point you order to your unconscious: “Go forward! Go backward!” at this point you now your mind is receptive. You can use this state to suggest that your gaze is stronger and you are in balance with the elements. We can use this exercise both improving our personal gaze magnetism and to give suggestions to the unconscious. First awakening of the hermetic caduceus This exercise will begin developing your inner fire (kundalini). It is a simpler and faster version of the first awakening of the hermetic caduceus of the Egyptian school (see abraxa’s exercise). With this exercise you will bring your mind in a new state.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these mirror exercises offer a practical and effective way to develop inner fire, improve personal gaze magnetism, strengthen gaze, and enhance intuitive power and sensitivity.
