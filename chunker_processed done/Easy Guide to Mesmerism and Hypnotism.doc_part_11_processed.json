  "title": "\"Mesmerismus®: The Ancient Secret School of Hypnotic and Mind Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the ancient secret school of Mesmerism that the author, Marco Paret, and his friend Max Tira were initiated in. They learned about a unique system that is different from modern psychology, and the years they spent exploring different hypnotic and mind techniques were beneficial to them. After years of research, Marco discovered that Mesmerism is not just a technique but a way of behaviour. He also found the complete original model of Mesmerism, which consists of rejuvenating exercises that encompass both physical and mental aspects. The last 200 tokens give insights into the various exercises included in the complete system.",
  "content": "I also met other persons using this technique: among them I will cite the late Erminio di Pisa, who was also one of the last expressions in Italy, and maybe in Europe, of the art of “Fascination” and who was also a true expression of the inner gifts and behaviour of a magnetist. It is important to understand that Mesmerism is not only a technique. It is something strictly connected to the person practising it, more along the lines of behaviour rather than a method. With the guide of my previous knowledge, I could recognize other exercises and ideas completing the basic system and better grasp what, in all certainty, was the complete original model. The books in print each contain only a small piece of this factual ancient and secret (and once even sacred) wisdom. Many times information is given in a coded way as many operators didn’t want to explain everything. Anyway, I had the key. In reality everything is a “Summa de Rerum Natura” which can be understood only if you know what lies behind... The complete system encompasses a lot of exercises, both physical as mental. These exercises are also rejuvenating.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism is not only a technique but a way of life that can expand human potentialities in both practical and spiritual fields. By practicing Mesmerismus®, one can develop life force and rejuvenate both physically and mentally. Take the opportunity to unlock the secrets of this ancient and sacred wisdom for a powerful impact and personal influence."
