  "title": "\"The Symbol of the Green Lion: Time and Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding tokens, the concept of the Green Lion has been presented as a symbol of the recovery of primitive and animal forces in man, linked to nature, and vital force derived from accessing the inner self. Moving forward, the focus shifts to the effects of this attainment on time and reality. While time is a measure of change and transformation, ancient people perceived it as being governed by fixedness under Saturn. However, accessing the quintessence can alter perception and remove the static reference point, leading to a less rigid reality. While programming time is valuable in daily life, its conceptualization is a mutable construct of the mind.",
  "content": "In the view of the ancient people, time did however lie under the authority of Saturn (or Chronos), who represents fixedness. It possesses the “rigidity of the stone”. In order to measure time, in fact, one ought to have a reference point which is both theoretical and static. But at a level (even an initial one) of perception of the “quintessence”, of access to the “sensorium commune”, perception changes and there is no longer a static reference to be found. Reality appears to be less “fixed” and rigid. Naturally, the capacity to program is useful in daily life because, if one has to embark on a journey, time has to be computed. This, however, is a specific and instrumental purpose which is founded on the conceptualization of some elements (for instance, the physical destination to reach). Every conceptualization is created by the mind and can undergo a change.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the measurement of time serves a practical purpose in our daily lives and requires a static reference point, our perception of time can be fluid and subjective. By accessing the quintessence of our experiences, we can gain a deeper understanding of time and its role in our lives, which can aid us in our journey towards personal growth and fulfillment."
