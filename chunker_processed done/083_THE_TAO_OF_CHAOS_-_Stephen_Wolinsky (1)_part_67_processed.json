  "title": "Therapy and Strange Attractions: Integrating Quantum Physics and Chaos",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the therapy sessions were discussed, how the therapist adds their energy in the form of techniques and models to make a significant shift in the energy pattern of the client. In this last segment, the emphasis is on how long it takes to shift energy patterns and a phenomenon of strange attraction. The author talks about integrating Quantum Physics with chaos to develop a unified field theory of human behavior. The text highlights how human behavior can be understood better by working on ourselves or with others, observing, and expanding our understanding of the context. It delves into the resistance of false selves to change, fearing death or disappearance.",
  "content": "This phenomena of strange attractions, whereby interactions seem random, are strangely at- ________________ tracted to the same endpoint. Few therapists would deny that to make a major and lasting change in the energy pattern takes time. Hopefully, over time, clients become more aware of this pattern, and by adding their own energy of awareness to their own system, eventually they might leave the relationship, find a new job, or maybe stop reacting. Why does it take so long to shift this energy pattern? Why does this re-ordering take so long? This is the essence of integrating Quantum Physics with chaos in developing a unified field theory of human behavior. It is working with oneself or with another to wake up the observer and instill the generator of awareness, which leads us to expanding our context that a problem occurs in. This leads us to see the underlying order in the chaos. Unfortunately, as will be discussed later, to I-dentities and false selves this order or Essence seems like chaos, hence an I-dentity or false self resists it out of a fear of death or disappearance.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, integrating Quantum Physics with chaos is essential in developing a unified field theory of human behavior. The process of shifting energy patterns takes time, but by waking up the observer and instilling the generator of awareness, we can expand our context and see the underlying order in the chaos. The resistance to change comes from false selves and identities fearing death or disappearance, but with patience and persistence, we can overcome it."
