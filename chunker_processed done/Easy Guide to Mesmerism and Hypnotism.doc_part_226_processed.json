  "title": "\"Psychological Influencing Techniques: Testing Susceptibility and Fascination\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this segment, techniques for testing hypnotic susceptibility and psychological influence are explored. Various methods are explained, such as making drawing passes on the spine or having a person place their hands on top of the hypnotist's hands. The text also mentions the importance of introducing these techniques in a subtle manner, without revealing the intentions of the hypnotist. The main concepts covered in the text are Testing Susceptibility, Fascination, and drawing passes, as well as the potential of individuals to be influenced psychologically.",
  "content": "The best plan is not to say what you intend to do until you are ready, then say quietly and firmly. “Now you cannot take your hands away.” The struggling and grimaces which follow will afford plenty of innocent mirthfulness to all concerned. This is called Fascination. Or, take his right hand and place it on top of your left hand, and make a number of passes down his arm and over his hand, with the intention of fastening his hand to yours. Continue this for a little time, and then make passes (with your right hand) down in front of his body to his knees, as if charging his body and less with your influence; then, make drawing passes at the knees with the intention of causing him to kneel. In a short time he will go down unresistingly upon his knees much to his astonishment and the amusement of others present, and perhaps of himself. Or, let him sit upon a chair and cross one leg over the other. Right or left leg—it is immaterial.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the use of fascination techniques and experiments should always be approached with caution and consent, these harmless and entertaining tricks can be a fun way to showcase the power of suggestion and hypnotic influence. Remember to always act responsibly and ethically when utilizing these methods, and enjoy the innocent mirthfulness they can bring to those involved."
