  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the importance of selecting the right subjects based on the type of experiment. The author emphasized the use of impressible subjects from the audience for general experiments. In this section, the author provides tips on how to conduct a successful mesmerism demonstration. The author advises starting with a compelling speech, citing authorities, detailing cures, and sharing personal experiences. The author also suggests asking for volunteers from the audience and ensuring their safety when mesmerized. Finally, the author recommends creating a peaceful environment with soft music and dim lighting to enhance the effects of mesmerism.",
  "content": "If you are in earnest, therefore thoroughly interested in your subject, you will soon personally impress your audience, and prepare them to assist you in giving your entertainment. The next thing you do is to ask for volunteers— ordinary people from the audience—to come upon the platform. While doing so, impress upon those you ask “you will see that they came to no harm— you will take every care of them if mesmerised.” Those whom you are not able to get under influence can go back to their seats again and enjoy the performance. With the exception of one, let all the rest of your previously made subjects remain in the audience. It is a good thing for some one to lead the way after you give your invitation. The next thing to do is to especially impress upon the audience to keep as quiet as possible. Direct your musician to play something soft and sweet—kindly music, with “a dim religious light” in it—and thus assist the effect you wish to make on your audience and subjects. These latter can either be seated facing the audience or sitting sideways.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following these simple steps, you can successfully mesmerize your audience and impress them with your performance. Remember to ask for volunteers, ensure their safety, impress upon the audience to keep quiet, and play music to set the tone. With these tips, you can give a memorable entertainment that will leave them wanting more."
