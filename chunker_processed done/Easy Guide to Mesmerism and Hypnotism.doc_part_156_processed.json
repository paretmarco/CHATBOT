  "title": "\"Developing Clairvoyance: Tips for Mesmerists and Sensitives\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discusses the importance of healthy and pure physical and mental faculties in achieving clairvoyance. Now, the author refers to the process of putting a patient under mesmeric sleep and awakening them to achieve somnambulistic or clairvoyant stages. However, the author warns against any \"hot-house planting\" or forcing the development and emphasizes the need for patience and careful observation. The text is a cautionary note to both mesmerists and sensitives, as they can only furnish favorable conditions but not create clairvoyance.",
  "content": "With the foregoing explanatory digressions, I assume that your patient has been put asleep, and that you have been able not only to comfortably accomplish this, but to awaken him—(some fall into apparent sleep, or into a natural sleep. Should you address them, they will either awake or sleep on. Should they, however answer your question—some simple question as “Do you feel comfortable?” in a quiet and intelligent way, the sensitives have, in all probability, passed into the mesmeric somnambulistic stage, which frequently precedes the lucid or clairvoyant stage).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, entering into the mesmeric somnambulistic stage can uncover a greater understanding of the individuality and exalted existence of your patient, allowing them to converse with clarity and wisdom. Being open to this experience may lead to valuable insights into human nature, personal growth, and the destiny of humanity."
