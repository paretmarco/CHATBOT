  "title": "\"Erasing Traumatic Memories without Medication: Recalling and Rewriting\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the power of re-enacting a symptom followed by a \"void\" state to eradicate the symptom altogether was discussed, and the theory was scientifically supported through experiments. In this last part, a research conducted by Elizabeth Phelps of New York University is highlighted. Published in Nature, the study shows that it is possible to erase awfully frightening memories by recalling them first and then overwriting them with a different memory within six hours. This method holds crucial benefits for people that suffer from anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress.",
  "content": "In an earlier study, she had successfully tested the method on a number of small mice. It has been shown in the experiment that all one needs in order to wipe out an awfully frightening memory is by first recalling it. Thereafter, within a six hoursâ€™ time window, one writes over it a memory other than the scary one, exactly as it would happen if we were to tape over an existing recorded base. The important thing is to do it within six hours from the moment when the memory is recalled, for it is within such a time span that fear becomes entrenched again. Anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress are linked to bad experiences which become rooted in the mind. Whenever a certain stimulus reminds one of the experience he had gone through, fear resurfaces and anxiety grows, even though the stimulus is not dangerous per se.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the study has found that it is possible to overcome a frightening memory by recalling it and within a six-hour time span overwriting it with a new memory. This technique can potentially help individuals suffering from anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress to overcome their fears and anxieties by replacing them with positive memories."
