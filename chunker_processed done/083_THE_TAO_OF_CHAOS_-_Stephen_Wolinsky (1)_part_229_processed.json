  "title": "\"The Discrepancy between Who People Pretend to Be and Who They Really Are\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding segment, the focus shifts to the impact of self-deception and vanity on psychotherapy. The author asserts that our fixation on how we want to be seen, rather than who we truly are, often propels us into seeking therapy. Through examples from his Quantum PsychologyÂ® workshop and character analysis, he highlights the painful discrepancy between our created images and our authentic selves. He further explains how people pretend to be present in their bodies, while their attention is fixated outside, self-deceiving themselves to look good to others. The author notes that this internal vacuum, caused by the trauma of loss of essence, fuels our insecurities and fears of being seen as inadequate.",
  "content": "A phallic narcissistic man might sexually be giving, but his attention or O.K.ness is not on himself and his feelings, rather it is how good a lover the partner thinks he is. Hence his orgasms are not complete. Why? Because he is not in his body. We must remember that although people appear as though they are in their body and present does not mean they are. For example, people who exercise are not necessarily \"in their body.\" They might be wondering how good they will look by exercising. Hence they are outside of their body experiencing how others might see them. Practitioners of spirituality or psychology are often becoming healthy, clear, or more spiritual to look good to another, rather than for themselves. This is self-deception and vanity at a more subtle level. At the deepest level, the trauma of the loss of Essence makes the observer/personality dyad feel like there is an internal vacuum which they label as an \"inability to do\" which must be hidden.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to remember that being present in one's body goes beyond the physical level. The need to fill an internal vacuum through constant achievements or dominating behavior can lead to a deep sense of self-deception and vanity. True self-awareness is about acknowledging this internal void and working to heal it from within rather than seeking external validation or over-compensating for it. By doing so, we can achieve true fulfillment and evolve into our best selves."
