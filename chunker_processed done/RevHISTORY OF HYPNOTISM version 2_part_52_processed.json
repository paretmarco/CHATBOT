Such ideas arising through a desire of doing good are heard afar off, and reach the object pointed out by the will, whatever may be the intervening distance.\" Alchemical symbolisms Alchemists used a complex set of symbols in order to transmit their ideas. Symbols were also a system to speak to the non- rational mind and unconscious part of the mind. Words are not the best tools to get in contact with the deeper strata of the human being. This use of symbols can be accepted even in a modern quantistic interpretation. Late modern (Einsteinian) physics insists that what we call “matter” is inseparable from the energetic flux of space-time (E = mc2). In an analogous way the sphere of human “spirituality” is not quarantined from the material sphere – as though we were dealing with two types of substance (material and immaterial) – but wholly entangled within (albeit emergent from) the sphere of materiality.22 Symbols become therefore tools of transformation. Small course in some basic hermetic aspects.",
