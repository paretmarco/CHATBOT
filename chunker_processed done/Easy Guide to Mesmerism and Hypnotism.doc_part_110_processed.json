  "title": "How to Mesmerize: Inducing and Awakening Mesmeric Coma",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we'll learn about the awakening process of a mesmeric coma. The author advises the mesmerist to employ different methods for each patient, as some individuals awaken easier than others. The text also mentions that just because a patient doesn't show signs of being mesmerized, it doesn't mean that the technique isn't working. Furthermore, we're told that there are cases where a patient should be allowed to sleep for an extended period. The author warns that the mesmerist should take care to determine which patients can be left alone during sleep and which ones require the mesmerist's presence.",
  "content": "Should, however, the patient experience a difficulty in opening his eyes, then with the tips of his thumbs the operator should rub firmly and briskly over the eyebrows from the root of the nose outwards towards the temples, and finish by blowing or fanning, taking special care before leaving the patient in that condition judging from the expression of his normal state. As a rule, the patient should not be left until the operator is perfectly satisfied that he is wide-awake. â€œThere are certain cases, however, where the sensitives should be allowed to sleep for two or three hours, or even more, and particularly when lengthened sleep has been prescribed by the patients themselves. Cure must be taken to ascertain that they can be left alone with impunity. The majority may be; but there are cases where the operator should not be absent during the sleep. With a little observation the mesmeriser should be able to distinguish between such cases, and learn to adapt his treatment according to the peculiar temperament or constitution of each patient.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism can be a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled operator, but great care must be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient. By observing their temperament and constitution, and adapting the treatment accordingly, the operator can achieve great results, both in treating specific conditions and in improving the patient's overall health and well-being. With proper guidance and supervision, mesmerism can be a valuable addition to the arsenal of treatments available to the modern practitioner."
