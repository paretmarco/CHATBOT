  "title": "\"Accessing the All-Powerful Whole through Quantic Theory Reflections\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text presents a series of reflections founded on modern quantum theory to explain the concept of the “all-powerful whole”. The Universe is a whole, but our perception only “exercises” some parts of it. This idea is central to the homonymic theory developed by Pribram and Bohm, which states that every sense works like a lens, refocusing the visual waves. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into this concept, discussing the “all-powerful whole” as a likeness to the concept of “omnipotence” and the white light as a quantic superposition. The ancient people linked clairvoyance to this concept, and some nations still observe fire to draw inspiration from it.",
  "content": "We might name this whole an “all-powerful whole”, by using, that is, its likeness to the concept of “omnipotence” which is utilized in the biology of the stem cells that are capable of developing inside any cell of the organism. The white light is an “all-powerful whole”, in that it contains all the colours by virtue of a quantic superposition. What we call reality is only the light which is reflected upon the different objects. In the white light, every visible object is already present in principle. Many experiences share the experiencing of light. When we observe the light, and, even more importantly, when we are able to see white light, or imagine it, even when we close our eyes, we are drawing close to the “all-powerful field”, which is very similar to the concept of \"quantic field\". The ancient people, for example, used to link clairvoyance to it, and there are many nations who up to today observe fire to draw inspiration.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of the \"all-powerful whole\" and its likeness to the quantum field can help us draw closer to experiences shared by many cultures, such as clairvoyance and inspiration. Developing the sixth sense and direct perception of wisdom can aid in accessing these experiences. So, why not try the exercise of looking at polarized light in the mirror and focusing on someone you know to practice your clairvoyance?"
