  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, this edited transcript of a therapy session sheds light on how the observer/personality dyad fixes its attention on seeking flattery and filling chronic emptiness, reinforcing the underlying compensation of pride to a-void the trauma of loss of being. The therapist guides the client to shift their focus to experience the perfection and peaceful connection of Essence, leading to reabsorption of the Observer/I-dentities into Essence. By doing so, the essential quality becomes stable, and the fixation on imperfection and seeking external validation shifts towards exploring the emptiness within.",
  "content": "For this reason the observer/personality looks outside itself for perfection. In fixation of attention strategy #1, the perfection being sought by the observer/personality dyad is found and stabilized in the perfec- tion and peace which is inside in the Essence of their Real Self. I'M O.K. IF YOU FLATTER ME YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU FLATTER ME T his fixation of attention of the observer/ personality dyad is also called the Giver by Palmer, The Helper by Riso, and Egocentric Generosity by Naranjo, and demonstrates a fixation of attention on flattery. In other words, the observer/personality dyad places all its attention on getting flattered or flattering oneself which reinforces the underlying compensation of pride. Furthermore, in order to get attention and flattery from outside this fixation over-compensates for what lies beneath the underlying state of pride which is inadequacy which covers the chronic emptiness. There is no attention on the emptiness, all attention is on receiving attention through flattery, which is an attempt to reinforce pride and a-void the trauma of loss of being. In pop-psychology language it can be seen as a major part of co-dependency. In this observer/personality dyad which develops around the Essence, the trauma and the pain of the loss of Essence is overwhelming.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the fixation of attention strategy #1 and #2 described in this text highlights the tendency of the observer/personality dyad to seek external validation, flattery, and overcompensate for the underlying feelings of inadequacy and emptiness. By turning inward towards the Essence of their Real Self, one can find the stability, peace, and perfection that they seek. Understanding these fixation strategies can help individuals work towards breaking free from co-dependency and false pride, and instead cultivate a strong sense of inner self-worth and independence."
