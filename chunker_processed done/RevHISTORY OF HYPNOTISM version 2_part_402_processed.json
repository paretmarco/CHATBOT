  "title": "Can Mesmerism Induce Delirium and Remove Pain Without Knowledge of the Patient? A Case Study.",
  "first_phrase": "In this final segment of the text, the author highlights the astounding effects of Mesmerism on a patient's memory, recollection of time, and perceptions. The patient's insensibility to pain during surgery, induced by Mesmerism, is further exemplified. This reveals the potential of the practice in medicinal treatment. The author suggests that if surgery can be performed painlessly under Mesmerism, there need not be any hesitation in testing the efficacy of this practice. The text raises questions about the future of Mesmerism and its potential in medicine, with time being the ultimate judge of its success.",
  "content": "The insensibility was produced in a few minutes in the ordinary manner; and while she was talking, and in the middle of a sentence, the seton was thrust through at the back of her neck. She took no notice whatever of it, finished the sentence, continued talking, and evinced not the slightest pain, nor could the least trace of suffering be discerned in her countenance. The wound was dressed, her clothes re-adjusted, and she was then restored to her natural state in a few minutes, perfectly unconscious of having been the subject of any operation, as was evinced by her saying, some time afterwards, that she thought somebody had been pinching her neck, for it felt very sore, and was perfectly astonished when told that a seton had been introduced. Surely this circumstance alone is sufficient to justify an inquiry into Mesmerism. If by this means painful operations may be performed without the knowledge of the patient, why do surgeons hesitate for one moment to put its efficacy more extensively to the test? \"What further advantage medicine may hope to derive from the more extensive adoption of Mesmerism remains to be proved; time alone can solve the question.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism's ability to perform painless procedures on patients who are unconscious of the operation without any visible signs of pain is remarkable. Surgeons should consider extending the use of Mesmerism to test its effectiveness in medicine, and only time will tell what benefits can be derived from it. The case of Hannah Hunter is a testament to the positive results that can be achieved through a combination of treatment types."
