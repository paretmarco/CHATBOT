  "title": "\"The Last Fascinator: Virgilio T. and His Hypnotic Powers\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about Virgilio T.10, the last of the fascinators and an expert in hypnotism and energy healing. He has practiced and perfected his techniques on thousands of people over the years and is still energetic in his eighties. In this final section, we learn about his mysterious and secret exercises that not only help us to become more fascinating individuals but also to develop energy, sensitivity, and wellbeing. We also get to know about Virgilio's own journey of overcoming a congenital heart disease with his exercises. Through a practical experiment in his barber shop, Virgilio shows the power of his gaze and the influence it has on people.",
  "content": "He himself overcame in the past, while he was about 50 years old, a congenital hearth disease that was leading him to die merely because of his exercises. Physicians themselves did not understand how he had been able to overcome that and retrieve his health in full. The first one to meet him was actually a friend of mine, Max, who, having approached him in order to seek information on what hypnotism was, received a very practical reply to his inquiry. Virgilio T., who at that stage worked as a barber, asked those who were present at the barberâ€™s shop whether they agreed to take part in an experiment. Once he received a positive reply to his said request, he closed the door of the shop and firmly fixed his gaze on one of the customers, who had moreover assumed a somewhat defiant look. His defiant posturing only lasted for a very short period. Within a few seconds, in fact, that customer took on a livid appearance. Virgilio told him that cigarette was something bad.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Virgilio T.'s remarkable ability to overcome a serious heart condition and his practical demonstration of hypnotism in the barber's shop have left a lasting impression on those who witnessed it. His power of suggestion and control over the minds of others has been a subject of fascination and study for years, and his legacy remains a testament to the strength and ingenuity of the human spirit."
