  "title": "What were the experiments conducted by Esdaile in proving the transmission of mesmeric fluid through air and its effects at a distance?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the experiments performed by Dr. James Esdaile, a Scottish surgeon, to understand the effects of Mesmerism, a hypnotic technique. The first part of the text highlights Esdaile's belief in the transmission of the mesmeric fluid through a large body of air. In the last 200 tokens, Esdaile conducted various experiments with a prisoner named Janoo, at a distance of up to 30 yards. He also tried to understand if the mesmeric fluid could affect material substances. The text provides an interesting insight into Esdaile's experiments to prove the viability of Mesmerism.",
  "content": "On the following day he got Janoo to lie down with his face to the wall, and employed one of his assistants to engage him in conversation while he went to the other side of the wall and mesmerized him through it. After two ineffectual trials of a few minutes each, Janoo, who suspected nothing, fell into the mesmeric sleep. After this he mesmerised him in five minutes at a distance of thirty yards. By that time Janoo had become sufficiently accustomed to the influence of Mesmerism to be tried with mesmerized water, and Esdaile sent some of it to him by the attendant who usually took him medicine, and who gave it to him as if it were an ordinary dose. In two minutes he was deeply entranced. A peculiarity of Mesmerism in Janoo's case was that when the effect was produced he fell down suddenly, as if shot. Esdaile tried experiments to find out whether the \"fluid\" would affect material substances; for instance, whether it could be deposited upon them, as many magnetisers thought it could.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile's experiments with Mesmerism revealed its astonishing potential to affect both human and material subjects. His findings not only opened doors for new medical treatments but also shed light on the traditional practices of the Faquirs of India, proving Mesmerism's intimate association with religion."
