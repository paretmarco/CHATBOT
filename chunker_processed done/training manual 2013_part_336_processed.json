  "title": "\"Disconnecting Mind-Body Union for Temperament Balance\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of the \"separation of levels\" to disconnect the mind-body union and achieve balance. Now, we delve into the practice of vivifying symbols of elements to transcend temperaments. We will focus on fire, water, air, and earth, and how paying attention to them can help release emotions and bodily blocks. The present moment is the essence of man, and accessing it requires the right mindset and practices.",
  "content": "Let us now discover how we might access it. Vivification of the Symbols of the Elements A powerful method to develop, combine and transcend the various temperaments is to enliven symbols: ? fire and heat, which can be known by paying attention to the heat of the body. The power of such exercise can be further potentized once it is connected with light. We can observe that such type of attention naturally tends to “loosen” many emotions and bodily blocks. It is enough to feel the heat of the body and simultaneously perceive a white light. ? water, which can be known by directing attention to the horizontal direction provided by life, to the assimilation it exercises, and by further directing attention to the weight of the body. It is also the symbol of female sex and receptiveness. ? air, which can be known through relaxation exercises which channel attention to rhythmic breathing, and other ones aimed at creating space for our own selves. ? earth, which can be known via exercises to create tension and relaxation in the body.",
  "last_phrase": "By enlivening symbols of the elements and embracing linguistic-symbolical methodology, we can transcend our temperament and reach the quintessence. Through simple exercises of attention and relaxation, we can dissolve emotional and physical barriers and access higher degrees. The power of words complements this practice and helps us tap into the congealed reality of our existence."
