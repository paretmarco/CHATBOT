  "title": "\"Animal Magnetism and Magnetic Phenomena in Healing and Enlightenment\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discussed how magnetism was used to heal patients in the peasant class suffering from severe and obstinate diseases. We also mentioned Comte de Puységur, who healed an injured dog using magnetic passes. Now we will talk about how magnetism was used to develop somnambulistic faculties, demonstrating the spirituality of the soul and the distinction of two substances. Additionally, we will explore magnetic ecstasy, a state of mind where the ecstatic simply contemplates, and the more they contemplate, the more absorbed they become.",
  "content": "\"Of all the discoveries,\" said M. Deleuze, \"which have, since the remotest times, excited public attention, that of somnambulism is certainly the best adapted towards enlightening us respecting man's nature and attributes. The phenomena it lays before us demonstrate the distinction of two substances—the twofold existence of the inward man in a single individual, a direct proof of the spirituality of the soul, and a reply to all the objections which have been raised in denying its immortality. They are also evidence of that truth, so well known to the ancients, that man is an intelligence served by organs.\" “The external organs of sense are all, or nearly all, asleep; and yet he experiences sensations, but by another means. There is roused in him an internal sense, which is perhaps the centre of the others, or a sort of instinct, which enlightens him in respect to his own preservation.” Magnetic Ecstasy Another wonderful magnetic phenomenon is magnetic ecstasy. Ecstasy is a state where the mind of the ecstatic does not reflect, it simply contemplates; and the more it contemplates the more absorbed it becomes. Maybe we can trace it back to some hermetic-alchemical practices.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the phenomena of somnambulism and magnetic ecstasy offer insights into the intricate workings of the human mind and body. Not only do they provide evidence of the duality of substances and the spirituality of the soul, but they also demonstrate the interconnectedness of different parts of the body, allowing us to tap into our inner resources and energy fields to achieve a state of heightened awareness and contemplation. Ultimately, these discoveries invite us to explore and celebrate the mysteries of our human nature."
