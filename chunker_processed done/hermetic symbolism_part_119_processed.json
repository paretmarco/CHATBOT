  "title": "The Septenary of Metals-Planets and Seven Analogous Personalities.",
  "first_phrase": "In the first part of this text, the author discusses the role of the bodily Spirit and the immaterial Soul as the foundation of life. In the second part, the author introduces the Septenary of the metals-planets and basic colors to explain how each type of Circle (Body, Soul, and Spirit) correspond to a specific color, shaping the individual personality. The last part of the text presents two different types of personalities: The Doer, whose astral body overpowers the Soul and Spirit Circles, leading to a restless, impulsive, and practically intelligent type, while The Dreamerâ€™s phlegmatic character is dominated by a weak Body Circle leading to a lethargic life force and less influenced by Mercury, Mars, and Venus.",
  "content": "The Doer In this way, by moving the Body circle upwards so that it overlaps the normal area of the other two, Mercury , Venus and Mars are favoured at the expense of Jupiter , Saturn , the Sun and the Moon . Here we have an extremely pronounced individualisation, because the astral Body is endowed with an abundant vitality that powers a restless, active impulsiveness . These impetuous and changeable types are characterised by constant movement, working tirelessly to satisfy the demands of their passions, and displaying great practical intelligence. The weakness of the emotional Spirit is manifested in a less scrupulous conscience; while on the other hand, the reduction of the material nature means they will lack positivity and physical solidity: the organism will tire quickly. Martial energy will be more prevalent than solar ideality and there will be more crude sensuality than pure emotion . The Dreamer Contrary to the lively, unsettled type we have the phlegmatic character, whose Body circle is dwindling away. As a result Mercury , Mars and Venus do not have a lot of influence. The individual personality is erased, the instincts are reined in and the life force is lethargic.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the influence of the Body, Soul, and Spirit circles can shed light on our individual tendencies towards impulsiveness, dreaminess, or a balanced nature. Developing self-awareness and working towards balance can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life."
