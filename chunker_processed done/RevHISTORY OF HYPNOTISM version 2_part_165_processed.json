  "title": "Understanding Magnetism: Sensitivity and Synergy in Healing.",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author explores how the practice of magnetism requires developing an inner sensitivity, which allows a practitioner to observe and direct the energy currents that flow through their body, aiding in the healing of others. The editor notes that magnetism is a natural aspect of our being and can be harnessed to create a deep rapport between practitioner and client, leading to positive transformation. The author also discusses the disputes within the scientific community surrounding Mesmer's discoveries and the issue of reductionism.",
  "content": "Slowly pass your hand along your own body, and discover the different sensations you feel. At the beginning it can be difficult, but with the time you will discover different sensations in different parts of the body. Magnetism and the point of view of the reductionists Since the time when Mesmer first brought his discoveries to the attention of the scientific world the students of the phenomena which he evoked have been hopelessly at variance. That they should entertain diverse theories regarding the cause of phenomena so strange and full of mystery is natural. “That they should, in the absence of knowledge of the subject, abuse and vilify each other because of their differences of opinion, was to be expected. Hatred of our neighbor because his problematical theories do not agree with our undemonstrable hypotheses is, unfortunately, one of the salient weaknesses of human nature”86.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, take a moment to explore the sensations of your own body. With time, you may discover new and unique experiences in different parts of yourself. Despite disagreement and criticism, the reality and mystery of magnetism and its effects continue to persist throughout history."
