  "title": "\"Ascending Consciousness: An Exploration of Mirror Work\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the four stages of working with mirrors to gain a deeper awareness of different levels of consciousness. Now, we delve into the symbolic death of the self, which opens up the practitioner's mind to higher dimensions. By transcending physical and emotional states, we can view physical and imagination stages as \"below\" us. This method of self-transcendence is called OPUS 1 and is achieved through a series of steps, from physical to cosmic consciousness. The last 200 tokens discuss the initial step of staring at oneself in the mirror and gradually increasing the intensity and duration of the practice, all while maintaining clarity and consciousness.",
  "content": "We will understand there is an ourself that looks and it is mirrored, but there is also a further higher self beyond the former two. Fourth and last step is the most high level of cosmic consciousness. Let's begin now in finding a quiet room, and look at yourself without blinking. \"Staring at the image in the glass, after a short time you will see the contours of the face, and the contours of the objects in room. They will almost vanish in a milky cloud that will form quickly. During the first few times, until the eye will be capable of withstanding with absolute certainty the burning and the excitation it is necessary, with a in fact mild effort of will, to return to the initial vision, absolutely clear. You can then indulge in this feeling gradually increasing the duration and intensity. One thing is absolutely essential for one who wants to initiate this practice: never lose consciousness,always keeping an unaltered state, perfect clarity, avoiding to fall into hypnotic sleep. Breathing should be complete and long as much is possible but without doing effort.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the exercises mentioned above, we can gradually develop our ability to see beyond our physical self and tap into the higher plane of consciousness. With patience and persistence, we can experience the wonders of the universe that would otherwise remain hidden from us. Remember to stay focused, breathe, and never lose consciousness."
