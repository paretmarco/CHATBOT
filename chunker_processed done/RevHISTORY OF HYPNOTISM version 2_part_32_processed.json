  "content": "I need hardly say that I fully recognise the practical value of much of the work which our Hypnotists have done in some special directions, but I think that their labours would bear more and better fruit were they to lay aside their prejudices, and make themselves acquainted with what others have done in much the same field before Modern Hypnotism was born.‚Äù13 The first step is beginning to accept the reality of the necessity of a more open mind toward new possibilities.

Summary of some differences between Hypnotism and Animal magnetism As we have mentioned, there are currently bodies of national legislation, such as the one in Germany, which grant explicit and official recognition to the existence of alternative therapeutic methods, including those associated with naturopathy or based on magnetism, along with other varieties, which we do not intend to tackle in this context.",
