  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the ego's tendency to alienate from the present moment by dwelling on the past or planning for the future. This split from the body and present moment is due to the ego's individualistic nature, which is programmed to achieve desires and can lead to craving, sorrow and fear. However, staying present is essential for achieving stronger results with clients. In the final part, the author emphasizes the importance of focusing on the body and listening to intuition to achieve \"clairaudience\" and never failing.",
  "content": "Another basis for the existence of such linear time is also the \"craving\". The individualistic ego is also our \"programming mind\" that helps us in getting what we want. Nevertheless, since we want to get “too much”, we will ,actually, remain in our \"programming mind\". As Dhammapada states: \"From craving arises sorrow and from craving arises fear. If a man is free from craving, he is free from fear and sorrow\" 31 STAYING IN THE PRESENT If you and your client will both stay in the present, the resulting effects of what you do will be stronger. For staying in the present the first step is to focus your attention on your body never trying to plan it logically. As you see a client, let your unconscious mind and your intuition say you what to do, you will see that if you follow it you will never fail. This quality is strictly linked to what is called \"clairaudence\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, staying in the present moment and being free from craving can lead to a life without fear and sorrow. To achieve this, focus on your body, listen to your intuition, and incorporate certain rhythms to promote brain coherence. By doing so, you can experience time in a new way, leading to a more meaningful and fulfilling life."
