  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the nature of consciousness and how it differentiates into an observer and observed, causing the illusion of separateness. This concept of separateness is at the heart of much human suffering. In the last 200 tokens, we delve deeper into this idea with the help of East Indian philosophy and the concept of Chitshaki Vilas. The Tao of Chaos encourages us to embrace chaos as a way to explore the play of consciousness and the illusion of separateness.",
  "content": "First that space has different positions and phases or parts (this is why in Chaos Theory it is called phase space). Furthermore, the observer differentiates time into past, present, and future (phase time). The observer then differentiates solidness or mass into phases, more solid less solid (phase mass), and finally differentiates energy into various intensities from very intense to no energy (phase energy). What is fascinating is that although everything is made of consciousness which is condensed emptiness, to the observer there is an appearance of differences where there are no differences. Once an observer arises so do differences. The observer and observed are consciousness, yet to the observer they appear as separate. This concept of separateness causes suffering. In East Indian philosophy it would be said that although consciousness appears to be un object or an observer, consciousness can never lose its true nature of being consciousness. Consciousness can, however, pretend to be separate from itself and thus experience separation. This in the sanskrit is called Chitshaki Vilas; The Play of Consciousness. The Tao of Chaos is asking us to begin to discover this play of consciousness by going into chaos.",
  "last_phrase": "Embracing chaos and the appearance of separateness can lead to a deeper understanding and connection to consciousness, ultimately transcending the limitations of thought and entering into a state of Essence. Remaining in the emptiness prior to the arising of thoughts, as advised by Nisargadatta Maharaj, allows for a glimpse into this deeper reality."
