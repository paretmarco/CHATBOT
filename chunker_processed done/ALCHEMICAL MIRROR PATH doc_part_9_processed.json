  "title": "\"Exploring Higher Self Through Mirror Gazing Practice\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the concept of a higher self beyond our physical and reflected selves. Now, we will explore the fourth and final step towards achieving cosmic consciousness. This involves staring at oneself in a mirror and gradually increasing the duration and intensity of the practice without losing consciousness or clarity. Additionally, the author provides another exercise - standing in a dark room with closed eyes - to strengthen one's psychophysiological reactions. The section also covers the physical phenomena that may occur during mirror-gazing, including the appearance of a fog that slowly becomes denser and darker.",
  "content": "Apart from the exercise with the mirror there is also another exercise that is very useful to be done apart from a few hours: standing, in a room perfectly dark, with the eyes closed, concentrate your mind trying to recall the experience above and trying to recreate the various psychophysiological reactions; whilst keeping the eyes open one may see some forms appear, sometimes brighter, and this appearing will be more precise as the ability develops. Later it will be also possible to develop the vision with closed eyes. FIRST PHYSICAL PHENOMENA - FIRST STAGE (? Earthly phenomena) The phenomena that you may begin to notice in practice with the mirrors are various. Stare at yourself on the third eye, where the nose touch the forehead, or, and some of the phenomena will appear faster, in the left eye. At the begin, a fog will appear around the image. The fog on the image reflected in the mirror slowly will become more dense after total and then goes darkening.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises like gazing at oneself in the mirror or standing in a dark room with closed eyes can lead to experiencing various psychophysiological reactions and visions. While these experiences may not occur immediately or with the same rapidity as reading, with practice and persistence, one can develop their ability to see auras, magnetic and mental energies, and even visions in the fluidic level. By opening ourselves to this new dimension, we can unlock deeper levels of perception and understanding."
