  "title": "What is the Success Rate of Lafontaine's Magnetic Therapy Method and How Was Telepathy Explored?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, it was discussed how Lafontaine's method of magnetic therapy had a success rate of over 80% in various illnesses like paralyses and migraines. Now, the focus shifts to the concept of entanglement between the operator and the patient. The gaze was a critical aspect of Lafontaine's work and was seen to have an immensely significant impact on the outcomes of the therapy.",

This entanglement, when using the gaze, becomes extraordinarily strong. The gaze was central in the work he did.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetic therapy can have extraordinary effects on a wide range of health issues. Lafontaine's method highlights the importance of entanglement between the operator and subject, with the gaze being a significant tool. The development of telepathic powers in subjects was a common practice in early mesmerism that yielded successful results. With thorough investigation, magnetism can prove to be a powerful healing tool in the future of medicine."
