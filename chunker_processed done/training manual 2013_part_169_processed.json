  "title": "\"Phosphatic exercise for equalization of electric conditions\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is part of a larger text about exercises that can improve your health and restore your youth. In the last 200 tokens, the author advises the reader on how to distribute phosphatic fluids to the extremities of the body through a specific breathing exercise. This helps equalize the electric conditions in the body and awaken inactive nerve centers. However, the author warns to avoid shocking sensations that may occur when the fingertips touch. The author also reminds the reader not to become too enthusiastic and run around telling everyone about the exercises, as friends and acquaintances will soon notice the changes and ask about them.",
  "content": "We must forgive the latter; they knew no better, and God in all His mercy will not call them to account, for He is merciful and just and will forgive us all our sins and cleanse us from all iniquities. In going through your exercises you do not want to become enthused and run about the neighborhood and enquire as to your appearance, or brag about the wonderful benefits you are receiving from the work. It is nobody's business what you do. Your inquisitive friends will notice soon enough the great change for the better and will be only too anxious to learn of the methods you use in acquiring such a youthful appearance and such excellent health. They will come to you as you have come here, to learn, and they will yet sit at your feet with eagerness to learn as Mary at the feet of the master was anxious to take in his glorious sayings. And the end of it all will be that they will beg of you to take them to the fountain that they also may drink of its purifying waters.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, forgiveness and humility are important virtues that pave the way to a better life. It may take time for others to appreciate the positive changes in you, but do not be discouraged. Focus on your journey and share the benefits with those who seek guidance. Remember to take the exercise cautiously and in moderation, as with anything in life, balance is key."
