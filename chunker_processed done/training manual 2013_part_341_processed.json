  "title": "Physical and Dynamic Exercises for Increased Mindfulness",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explored the dynamic method of immersing linguistic combinations to create a change in listeners' minds. They suggest that this technique could be implemented secretly to avert problems. Now, they introduce a physical method known as \"Exercise 9: Physicality of the elements\". By stretching and relaxing different muscles while paying attention to essential elements such as air, heat, and weight, individuals can improve their perception of reality. The author explains the perceptive habit that causes the mind to get used to sensory inputs and make reality seems pale and lifeless.",
  "content": "Take care to often shift your attention between these essential elements. The final step is to slowly return to your state of normal wakefulness. Many people to whom we teach this exercise subsequently inform us that reality appears to them to be more vivid, and that colours have a more immediate impact. In truth, reality usually seems to us to be pale and lifeless on account of our “perceptive habit” which causes our mind to become progressively used to sensory inputs. This is the same reason why time seems to us to be shorter than it is. When, for instance, we retrace our steps through a particular road, the latter appears to us to be shorter during the return trip, as a result of the lesser number of the items of information which our mind extracts from the environment.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the dynamic knowledge exercise and separating the elements in your daily life can enhance your overall perception and awareness, allowing you to experience reality more vividly. Take the time to pay attention to the weight of your body, bones, breathing, and heat, and distinguish between sensory realities, emotions, actions, and thoughts to cultivate a greater understanding and intuition towards the world around you."
