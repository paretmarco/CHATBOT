  "title": "Mesmer's Life after Leaving the Harmony Society",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the life of Franz Mesmer, a pioneering figure in the field of animal magnetism, and his struggles with the Harmony Society and the Academy of Sciences. The first part of the text outlines Mesmer's conversation with an acquaintance who dismisses his magnetism theory, despite evidence to the contrary. In the latter part, the text focuses on the economic struggles that plagued the Harmony Society, ultimately leading to Mesmer's departure from France. He spent time in London, Italy, and Germany before the Revolution of 1789 broke out, causing widespread chaos and upheaval. Despite his sympathies with many of the revolutionary ideas, Mesmerism was largely forgotten as events unfolded.",
  "content": "Once he was gone, his opponents went on a rampage, causing Mesmer to spend a lot of time writing retorting libels61 which targeted their accusations62. He spent a short time in London before he set out for Italy and Germany, while still making some trips to France, strictly in disguise. He was for example spotted in Paris in 1793, on the day of the public execution of Bailly, who had been one of his most passionate antagonists and had chaired the 1784 Commission. Mesmer was the only person, amid an audience intoxicated by fury or paralyzed by fear, to cordially greet him 63. Immediately thereafter, in fact, the revolution broke out in 1789. Its avalanche caught his noble disciples as well. Nearly all the members of this cream of gentlemen, perched at that time on the summit of the collapsing building, atoned for their errors. As for the rest, they forgot about mesmerism, embroiled as they were in the unfolding of such colossal drama. Meanwhile, the creator of mesmerism sympathized with many of the ideas the revolution had highlighted.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the tumultuous events of the French Revolution had profound effects on Mesmer and his disciples, ultimately leading to the decline of mesmerism as a popular practice. While he sympathized with some of the ideas of the revolution, he also suffered from political suspicion and lost his fortune. Mesmer eventually settled in Switzerland, where he found peace and anonymity. Despite requests to resume his magnetic treatments, he chose instead to live a simple life, free from the troubles of the past."
