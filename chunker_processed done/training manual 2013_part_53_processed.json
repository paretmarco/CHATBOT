  "content": "“The power of Animal Magnetizing, is in our opinion, a very remarkable and important discovery, on account of the light which it throws upon the whole nature of man—his physical, mental, and spiritual condition. In its application to the cure of nervous complaints, and the relief of pain; in the examination of internal diseases; and in surgical operations, its value has been tested and proved by abundant experiments, which must be familiar to the reader. There is yet a vast field to be explored in this direction, and incalculable, we believe, will be the amount of knowledge which will be gained by future experiments. As a remedial agent in cases of head-ache, tooth ache, tic-dolereau, paralysis, chronic pains, convulsions, nervous debility, and other diseases of a similar character, it has been in the highest degree successful. In cases of violent nervous affections, such as shaking palsy, nervous irritation, titanic convulsions, great wakefulness, Sic, it is the only power that can afford immediate and permanent relief.",

With further exploration and experimentation, there is no doubt that this technique will bring about a wealth of knowledge and contribute to advancements in the field of medicine."
