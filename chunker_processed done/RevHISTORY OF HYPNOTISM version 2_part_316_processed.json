  "title": "What is the phenomenon of convulsive motions and how are they produced in magnetism experiments?",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the phenomenon of convulsive motions induced by magnetism or mesmerism. It begins with the report of an experiment where various individuals directed their fingers towards different body parts of a patient and noticed the production of convulsions, establishing that convulsions could be induced without fingers' approximation. The author goes on to share an example of M. Chales, French Consul at Odessa, whose hair and muscles around his left ear contracted upon being magnetized. In the end, the author presents the case of M. Petit, for whom the convulsive motions were developed with great precision by merely approximating the magnetizer's fingers.",
  "content": "The manipulations were renewed with a single hand, without directing the finger towards the ear, and we perceived in the ear a general and lively ascending motion. The finger was then directed towards the same ear, and no effect was produced. It was principally in the case of M. Petit, tutor (instituteur) at Athis, aged 32 years, that the convulsive motions were developed with the greatest precision by approaching the fingers of the magnetizer. M. Dupotet presented him to the committee upon the 10th of August 1826, informing them that this M. Petit was very susceptible of somnambulism, and that, when in this state, he, M. Dupotet, could at pleasure, and without speaking, by the mere approximation of his fingers, reduce visible convulsive motions in those parts which the committee should point out by writing. The patient was very speedily set asleep, and then the committee, in order to prevent all suspicion of collusion, handed over to M. Dupotet a note written at the moment in silence, in which they pointed out the particular parts which they wished to be convulsed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the experiments conducted by M. Dupotet with M. Petit demonstrated that somnambulism can induce visible convulsive motions. These findings could have potential applications in the medical and therapeutic fields, and further research in this area is warranted."
