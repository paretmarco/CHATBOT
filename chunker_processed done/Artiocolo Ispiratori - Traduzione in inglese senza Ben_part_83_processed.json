  "title": "\"Understanding Induced Hypnosis: Exploring the Realm of Occult Science\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article delves into the concept of induced hypnosis and its connection to the occult. It discusses the ability of some individuals to impose their will on others without speaking a word, as demonstrated by Professor Boirac's experiment with Dickmann. The text also explores the inhibitions that can condition hypnotized subjects, as seen in Dr. Teste's experiment with a magnetized lady. The last 200 tokens examine how paranormal telepathic gifts can enhance a hypnotizer's ability to influence their subjects.",
  "content": "Not all subjects, however, are «susceptible of being influenced» in a normal state. One can, however, presume that «almost everyone» would be susceptible of that once they are plunged in a state of hypnosis. Let us run again through the pages of the text we have referred to earlier: «One day, Dr. Teste mentally instructed a hypnotized woman to bring him some books, while at the same time he thought that a barrier, one meter high, was interposed between him and such hypnotized subject. The magnetized lady picked up the books from the table and was about to bring them to the doctor in accordance with the mental instruction she had received; once she reached the barrier which had only been envisaged mentally, however, she said to herself: «I cannot go further. There is a one meter high obstacle here». In short, there are «inhibitions» capable of conditioning the hypnotized subjects, provided the hypnotizer is endowed with paranormal telepathic gifts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it may be presumable that almost everyone is susceptible to hypnosis, inhibitions can still condition the hypnotized subjects. Further research is needed to determine the nature of these inhibitions and how they affect the patient's psychosomatic life."
