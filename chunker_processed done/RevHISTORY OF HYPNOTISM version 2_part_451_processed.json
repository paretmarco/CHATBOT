  "title": "How did Dr. Kean use Mesmerism to successfully treat patients in a lunatic asylum in the 1840s?",
  "first_phrase": "This historical text explores the use of mesmerism by Dr. Kean at Moorshedabad and Berampore Insane Asylums during the 1840s. The text mentions the success of the practice on blind patients and lunatics, with Dr. Kean eventually treating 74 patients through mesmerism and discharging 64 of them as \"cured.\" The text also suggests the possibility of suggestion being used alongside mesmerism. The use of mesmerism helped maintain discipline and quiet in the hospital. The practice of mesmerism changed the characteristics of the patients and brought great relief, which is why it was accepted and used extensively in the treatment of lunatics in the mid-19th century.",
  "content": "Esdaile says of him:-- \"Dr. Kean, of Berhampore, has for several years used Mesmerism very extensively in his large Lunatic Asylum with excellent curative effects, and finds it of great service in maintaining the quiet and discipline of his hospital.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Kean's successful use of Mesmerism to treat patients in his large lunatic asylum, as well as Esdaile's comprehensive study of the subject, demonstrate the potential benefits of exploring different avenues of medical treatment. By expanding our knowledge and incorporating diverse methods, we may find solutions that we had previously dismissed or overlooked."
