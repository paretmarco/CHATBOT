  "first_phrase": "In this text, we learn about the power of magnetic energy in reducing pain. The author shares different techniques for using this energy to move pain from one part of the body to another. The importance of intention in directing and concentrating this energy is emphasized. The editor notes the role of nonverbal suggestion in communicating with the body. In the final 200 tokens, the text discusses the effectiveness of combining these techniques with gaze to achieve faster results in pain relief. The text encourages the use of these simple methods to begin exploring the power of magnetic energy as a natural pain management tool.",
  "content": "We could even interpret this result of the movement that draws away the pain as a ‘non verbal suggestion’. We speak to the body with the movement, instead of saying anything. It is one of the simplest methods to begin with. This method can be reinforced with the gaze. In our experience it is only with the concomitant use of the gaze that the strongest results are achieved. In this case results are achieved in a few seconds. Without the gaze the methods requires more time. For example, if one has the headache, owing to the tendency of the blood to the head, if the forehead be hot and the feet very cold, by making a few passes from the head to the feet, and others along the legs, the head is relieved and the feet become warm.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the powerful effects of non-verbal suggestion through simple methods like movement and gaze have been proven through experiences of magnetizers and hypnotists. By using these techniques, it is possible to alleviate pain and disturbances and restore equilibrium in the body within a short period of time, making this an effective option for those seeking quick relief."
