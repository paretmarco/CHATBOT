  "title": "\"Breathe is Life\" Exercise for Better Health and Energy",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text describes a breathing exercise that should be done from one to three times per day, for no more than three minutes at a time. It involves inhaling while bending forward, holding the breath while mentally repeating the phrase \"Breath is Life,\" and exhaling while bending backward. It is important to breathe slowly and avoid straining the muscles of the larynx or chest. The exercise should be done in a well-ventilated room with the back turned against the light, and it is recommended not to overdo it. The text doesn't mention any names or concepts.",
  "content": "Repeat the sentence mentally, only somewhat more rapidly, to cover the space of about three or four seconds. Then exhale, repeating the sentence as during inhalation, \"Breath is Life.\" putting emphasis upon \"Life,\" and bend the body backward to its first position. Always empty your lungs thoroughly, yet with control. This exercise is to be done from one to three times, a day, for not longer than three minutes at a time. Of course, it is understood that during breathing exercises the room should be well aired and properly ventilated and that your back be turned against the light. When bending forward seven seconds is to be consumed. Then hold the breath for three or four seconds and exhale for seven seconds or longer in returning to the first position. You do not wish to overdo, but you are apt to lengthen your time of breathing to longer minutes than you would understand a minute to be. We would rather you would take less than overdo it.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember to give attention to these breathing exercises and follow them religiously, as you are the ones to derive the good from their observance. Just one to three times a day for not more than three minutes at a time, this exercise will help you generate and store surplus electric force, which can be used to supply the demand in time of need. However, be cautious not to overdo it; take less time rather than overdoing. Keep in mind that your body has its regulations and that you must follow them to achieve the greatest possible good physically, mentally, and spiritually."
