  "title": "Who was Jules Dupotet de Sennevoy and what was his contribution to the school of magnetism?",
  "first_phrase": "This text provides an account of animal magnetism and its practitioners. It sheds light on the work of F.A. Mesmer, De Puysegur, Baron Dupotet and the Durville brothers, all of whom made significant contributions to the field. Dupotet's methods and belief system are examined, such as his ability to magnetize people in their sleep and his assertion that complete incredulity cannot impede the practice of Magnetism. Additionally, he tested his techniques on various animals such as dogs, cats, and horses. In the last 200 tokens, the distinct levels of Magnetism and the extent of magnetizers' control over the subject is discussed.",
  "content": "He found that complete incredulity was no obstacle to the operation of Magnetism. He said that silk and metals have no counteracting effect, as at that time they were believed by other magnetisers to have. Magnetizing sleeping people Dupotet found that people could react to magnetism even while sleeping. For example, we read124 that after making passes for five or ten minutes over a child who had been put to sleep, he produced slight muscular contractions simply by bringing his finger near the muscles; by placing it near the breast he influenced the breathing, which became laboured; by passing his hand over the whole of the body he produced slight shocks, and finally awoke the child. Changing the breathing of a sleeping person was the first experiment that Dupotet said he had done to effectively learn magnetism125. Magnetizing animals Du Potet obtained similar effects on dogs, cats, even on horses. Different levels of Magnetism De Puysegur had said that the magnetiser will never be able to do more than to \"turn the handle\"; but Dupotet believed that the magnetiser could do more than only act mechanically, because he could to some extent understand and regulate ‘the machine’ itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Jules Dupotet de Sennevoy's experiments on magnetism proved that complete incredulity was no obstacle to its operation, as even sleeping people and animals could react to it. He believed that the wisest magnetisers were those who followed nature's course and did not presume to control it. Although he produced most of the phenomena now called 'hypnotic,' he gave his own peculiar magical explanation for them. Dupotet showed that magnetism is a fascinating and powerful force that requires further exploration and experimentation."
