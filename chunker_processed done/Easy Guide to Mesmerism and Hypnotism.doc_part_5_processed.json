  "title": "\"The Power of Animal Magnetism: Rediscovering an Old School Method\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the authors had introduced the concept of Animal Magnetism and the controversy over its credibility. In the last 200 tokens, the authors delve deeper into their findings and research on the subject, presenting evidence of its reality and power. They highlight how the modern scientific perspective of hypnosis has limitations and how it fails to acknowledge the subjective influence of the operator. The authors reference the work of Professor Bertrand Meheust, who has criticized the limited and biased approach of scientists in studying animal magnetism. They argue that there exists a powerful force that is directly connected to the operator's subjectivity, which is not taught in any university but can be harnessed through Animal Magnetism. Overall, the text challenges mainstream scientific paradigms and invites a new perspective on the power of the mind.",
  "content": "We, however, are not the only ones who believe that the modern scientific point of view of hypnosis has some problems. Professor Bertrand Meheust, a French University Professor, has written a very deep analysis of how science has put aside the paradigm of animal magnetism. He writes of how scientists have based their conclusions on very few laboratory observations, most of which are generally conducted with the goal of simply finding a way of denying these ideas, rather than searching out ways to reproduce these phenomena, and most important of all, how to use them effectively. There exists “something” that is not taught in any university, which we took years to grasp, and that “something” is very powerful. It is directly connected to the subjectivity of the operator. The school of Animal Magnetism is a reality, and thousands of old books about these powerful feats of magnetism can now be read as fact. Even though quantum theory has opened some possibilities beyond ordinary thinking, there is already a strong academic resistance to admitting not only the facts, but, even worse, admitting the positive results of the techniques themselves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while modern science has cast doubt on the existence and effectiveness of animal magnetism and mesmerism, the writings of J. Coates Ph.D. and Professor Bertrand Meheust suggest that there may be a gap in our scientific knowledge. Perhaps there is something unquantifiable yet very powerful that has been lost over time. Despite this ambiguity, it is clear that exploring the history of hypnotism and animal magnetism can reveal important insights into the human mind and the power of suggestion."
