  "title": "\"Mental Exercises for Improved Attention and Perception\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores techniques to enhance perception and attention through exercises that go beyond traditional methods. It starts with an exercise that involves watching slats without counting them, which leads to a deeper understanding of unity and Gestalt principles. The last two exercises focus on enhancing the connection between seeing and watching, which defines powerful attention. Additionally, it touches on the topic of entering a trance while performing eye movements and how to minimize it. The final exercise involves mentally tracking the symbol of infinity, and it might seem simple, but it is harder to accomplish correctly.",
  "content": "First attention: it stands on the particular, on the item. Second attention: it defines the so-called global attention that can reach up to the so-called Ganzfeld (in German, unique field) where there are no more contours. Watching attention focuses on the fovea and is linked to the process of thought and attention to closer elements. Seeing attention is then more global and connected to emotions. A complete and powerful vision combines the ability to see with that of watching because doing so also connects different brain areas. ExitING peripherals Trances We often move eyes in various positions and without realizing it we enter into a trance. The phenomenon has been observed in NLP. The following exercise is useful to minimize this type of \"trance.\" Infinity 1 Here is an exercise that seems easy, but it is very difficult to perform correctly. It is about tracking mentally without discontinuity and for a time growing the mathematical sign for infinity, similar to an 8 lying down. You can do it in the country or in open spaces.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the practice of seeing and watching attention and using exercises like Infinity 1 and 2 can help in developing a more complete and powerful vision. These practices can minimize the experience of trance, promote inter-hemispheric coordination, and enhance focus on the present moment."
