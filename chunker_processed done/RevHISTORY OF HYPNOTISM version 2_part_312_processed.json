  "title": "\"Why do Magnetic Enchantments Require an Agent from Within?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author describes the effects of a magical enchantment that causes a person to be magnetized and perform certain actions. This last part elaborates on the nature of this magical agent and how it operates within us. The author emphasizes the importance of the will and the power of the mind in successfully utilizing this agent. It is necessary to cultivate a spiritual sense and to awaken a fire within oneself to activate this agent. The author reminds us that this is a great mystery, and that success in the magical arts requires a deep understanding of the unknown.",
  "content": "Why must we, for the purpose of seeing clearly, use enchantments ?â€”It is because our Will alone is powerless, therefore must there be employed the resources of an agent that agitates and disturbs the Will. There is required an element to draw it out of repose. But what is it? From where is that agent to be taken? It is within ourselves. It is but a question of finding it, and to know how to set it in action. Do not think to succeed, if your Soul remains as cold as your hand. All must be preceded by an operation in your own mind. It is necessary for your success that there should be within you a fire that lights itself, and burns invisibly, and, as an essential act for reproduction, it should be your brain through which the vehicle should run, but no other organ, awakening within you a spiritual sense, and is it not necessary, as it treats here of unknown things? It is a great mystery.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to see clearly and bring our will into action, we must harness the power within ourselves by finding the agent that agitates and disturbs our will. By lighting the fire within our soul and mind, and using the technique of drawing a disc with coal, we can awaken our spiritual sense and create a well-marked path towards success."
