He is the typical person in whom you would confide the whole of your being merely ten minutes after first making his acquaintance -, is what I am enthusiastically told by a person who had just gone through the “magic” touch of his hands. As soon as he walks in, the smoker is allowed to rest on a couch. The healer is seated in front of him. Herman Michel points the fingers of his right hand in the direction of the patient’s forehead. His hand vibrates just a bit as he brushes the forehead and the temples. It is then that the «de-conditioning» of the hypothetical «nerve centre of smoking», the one wherein the impulse to smoke allegedly originates, is supposed to occur. The «wizard of smoking» takes off his hand from the eyes and, always without uttering any word, he massages the smoker along his arms.",
