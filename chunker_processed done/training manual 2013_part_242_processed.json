  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the use of fascination for regression and healing. Now, in the last part of the text, the author delves into the concept of \"Regressive States and Fascination\" and highlights two methods of regression - bodily or visual. The author also introduces the idea of touch therapy after inducing fascination in the subject. The text mentions the names of Prof. Erminio di Pisa and Faria, a Portuguese monk, who described the points used for touch therapy.",

Energy will be felt in its true nature and not through imagination, as most of the times happens. Therefore all energetic techniques, including magnetism, will have a stronger effect. In specific, Prof. Erminio di Pisa used a special technique where, after having fascinated the subject, he touched him in different points (already described by Faria, a Portuguese monk). These points have a requilibrating effect.",
  "last_phrase": "By mastering the art of fascination and touch, you can harness the power of energy to heal yourself and others. Through a variety of techniques, including spoken and silent regression, magnetic passes, and point touching, you can address anxieties and fears, as well as stop smoking. Try incorporating these methods into your daily routine and experience the astonishing results for yourself."
