  "title": "\"The Power of Activating the Enteric Brain for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about a powerful magnetism technique and how it activates our enteric brain, also known as the \"second brain.\" This enteric nervous system controls most of our physical body's functions and is connected to the solar plexus and hara centers. In this final section, we'll delve deeper into the importance of this second brain, and how cutting-edge research reveals that it even mediates our body's immune response. Get ready to discover the fascinating physiology of the enteric nervous system, and why it has been dubbed the \"second brain.\"",
  "content": "The two centers of solar plexus and hara are connected, and normally for stabilizing the person in the hara we must pass through a procedure of activation at the height of the solar plexus. You must realize that the enteric brain controls the majority of the functions of the physical body and, above all, that is it which created and which continues to nourish the brain17. If it ceases to do so a person becomes incapable of activity, he has a headache or feels drowsy and cannot think any more. Cutting-edge research is currently investigating how the second brain mediates the body's immune response; after all, at least 70 percent of our immune system is aimed at the gut to expel and kill foreign invaders. Just like the larger brain in the head, researchers say, the enteric system sends and receives impulses, records experiences and respond to emotions. Its nerve cells are bathed and influenced by the same neurotransmitters18. Physiology The enteric nervous system has been in fact described as a \"second brain\"19.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the enteric nervous system operates as a \"second brain\" and plays a crucial role in controlling many of the body's functions. The connection between the solar plexus and hara centers is important for stabilizing a person, and cutting-edge research is exploring its role in immune response. By understanding and nourishing our \"second brain,\" we can improve our overall well-being and health."
