  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author explores the concept of energy and healing traditions that deal with energy flow within the body. The author mentions Bioenergetics, a system created by Alexander Lowen, which looks at the body as a system with natural energy movement that can become blocked during trauma. The chronic inhibition of energy flow can cause dis-ease or neurotic behavior patterns. Lowen's work releases the body armor and restores the natural flow of bio-energy. The author emphasizes the importance of exploring these topics further through additional resources, which can be found in the bibliography.",

According to Lowen or Reich, the movement of energy becomes blocked during trauma, and the natural flow of bioenergy is inhibited. This natural flow of bio-energy when habitedly inhibited causes 90 • THE TAO OF CHAOS chronic body armor to prevent the e-motions (outward-motion) of energy. The chronic inhibition of the natural flow of energy can cause dis-ease, or in psychological terms, neurotic psycho-emotional behavior patterns. In the brilliant work of Reich and Lowen, the chronic body armor is removed, trauma released, and the bio-energy restored to its natural flow. This experience of the natural whole body flow of bioenergy, Lowen calls streaming. Alexander Lowen made major advances in Bioenergetics by including the arms and legs as well as the rest of the body in the process of releasing the chronic inhibitors to the flow of bio-energy.",
