  "title": "\"The Art of Magnetism: Techniques and Practices\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author provides practical advice on mesmerism techniques, including how to magnetize and demagnetize specific parts of a subject's body. The author also emphasizes the importance of concentration and visualization when attempting mesmerism from a distance or through solid barriers. Additionally, the author cautions against making direct passes at a subject's head and recommends the use of head passes and drawing passes for maximum effect.",
  "content": "If you intend to study Phrenology, and wish to familiarise yourself with the position of the organs, you should have a good lifesize cast of a human head, and upon each organ gum a small piece of coloured paper, at which you direct your passes, but in practice never make a Direct pass at any Subject's head for the purpose of exciting an organ, as it would be much too forcible. Head-passes are Direct-passes made towards the head of the Subject when you are situated above him, but instead of your fingers pointing out straight at the finish of the pass, they are more rounded, and rather loose. They are principally used when the Magnetiser is on a platform, and the Subject among the audience. They are made for the purpose of loading the Subject with influence, which you afterwards draw back to yourself, along with the Subject, by Drawing-passes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, studying phrenology requires a good life-sized cast of a human head with colored papers on each organ. Direct passes should never be made towards a subject's head, but instead, communicating and lifting passes are useful. Communicating passes can be used in daily interactions to add weight to your words, and lifting passes are helpful for manipulation experiments."
