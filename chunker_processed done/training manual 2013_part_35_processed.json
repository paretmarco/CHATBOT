  "title": "\"The Relationship between Emotions and Breathing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the author discusses how a person's emotions are reflected in the position and shape of their chest. They also examine the relationship between breath and spirit, stating how the Greek philosophy considers them to be the same. The author concludes by advising readers to pay close attention to their breathing and strive towards fuller breaths for better lung development. This final note suggests helpful exercises to extend breathing capacity.",
  "content": "While the breath and the soul are not identical (except in so far as stated Behind Closed Doors), it is true that the breath is essential to life, and becomes life in the chest! (Shaftesbury) FINAL NOTE If your breathing capacity is very small and your ailments many, you must remember that it will be necessary for you to pay more attention to fuller breathing until you will be able to do fully. When it pains you to take long, full breaths, you prove thereby the lack of lung development, and you will have to make it a point to breathe more fully oftener during the day. If you want to extend your breathing capacity, after having filled the lungs to their utmost capacity, raise up your arms in a circular motion, and as high up as you can with ease, at the same time move your tongue as if masticating, smack your lips, and swallow the saliva which has accumulated in the mouth.",
  "last_phrase": "To improve your breathing capacity and ensure a healthy life, pay attention to practicing fuller breathing frequently throughout the day. Use the exercise of raising your arms, masticating, smacking your lips, and exhaling slowly for at least seven times to develop your lungs. Ensure to wear loose garments, so your chest and diaphragm can expand easily, while your abdomen inflates automatically, allowing you to breathe properly."
