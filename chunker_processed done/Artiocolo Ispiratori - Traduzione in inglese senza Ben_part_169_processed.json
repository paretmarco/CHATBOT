  "title": "\"The Power of Light: Sun-gazing and Artificial Light in Improving Health and Psychic Gifts\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the ancient practice of sun-gazing, where people derive energy from the sun by gazing at it for an hour. Apollonius of Tyana, a philosopher, claimed that the sun was the God in person and would pray to it every sunrise or noon. While we don't recommend looking at the sun, artificial light can also stimulate us in similar ways. Dr. Lefebvre conducted research on the power of light in increasing concentration and psychic gifts, and our school has combined magnetism with light to overcome phobias quickly. In this last part, we delve deeper into the physics of light and the importance of light in our lives.",
  "content": "In our school, we utilize light to create the same type of stimulation, and we recommend using artificial light in order to avoid any eye damage. Use of artificial light Following the researches of Dr. Lefebvre, we also recognize the incredible power of light in increasing psychic gifts. He also used it as a help for improving concentration in students, and put it in writing that people would have better results. Starting from some of his ideas and from other ideas of people equally working with light, we have seen that combining magnetism with light can give wonderful results. We can put away phobias in a few seconds and we don not know of other methods as effective as that. Why is light so important? In order to understand the power of light, it is necessary to know something about the physics of light. If we cause the white light of the sun or of the electric arc-light to fall through a prism, the result is a splitting up of the light into its component rays.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, light is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to improve concentration, increase psychic gifts, and even overcome phobias. By using artificial light, we can avoid damaging our eyes while still benefiting from its therapeutic properties. Understanding the physics of light and the power of its component rays can lead to incredible results in various areas of life."
