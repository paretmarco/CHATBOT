  "title": "\"The Symbolism of the Philosophers' Stone\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the symbolism of the Philosophers' Stone in hermeticism. Before delving into the last 200 tokens, the author explains that the true initiate does not seek the admiration of the masses, and instead works in seclusion to prepare the stone. The stone is symbolized by the Square crowned by the Cross, and represents matter that has been refined and surpassed to uphold the manifestation of the spirit. The final surge of the spirit towards absolute emancipation is also explained. In the last 200 tokens, the primary relationships between the three aspects of the stone and the hermetic initiation are discussed. The author emphasizes that symbols are intended to awaken ideas and stimulate thought, and that they are not intended for everyone, especially those who rely solely on dogmatic or scientific formulae.",
  "content": "A symbol can always be seen from infinite different viewpoints, and every thinker has the right to discover a new meaning in it, according to his own reasoning and ideas. Symbols are, in effect, designed to awaken the ideas that lie dormant in our minds. They stimulate thought by way of suggestion, and in this way they force us to uncover the truths that are buried in the depths of our souls. As a consequence, in order for symbols to speak to us, it is imperative that the seed of the ideas - which the symbols aim to make germinate and throw forth shoots - already exists within us. No shoots could possibly sprout if the spirit was empty, inert or sterile. Symbols are not intended for just anyone. In particular, they tend to disorientate those supposed positive spirits, that have become accustomed to basing their reasoning on the rigid fixedness of dogmatic or scientific formulae. We do not dispute the practical utility of these formulae, which have allowed us to build, brick by brick, the whole towering edifice of modern science: to them we owe all the findings of scientific experimentalism and all the marvellous discoveries that are the glory of our age.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, symbols have the power to awaken the ideas that are dormant in our minds and stimulate thought. To fully appreciate symbols, it is necessary to have an open mind and to allow for the ambiguity and elasticity that is inherent in them. While precise formulae have their practical utility in science, symbols offer a complex and mobile reflection of undefined thought that leads to spiritual growth and understanding."
