  "title": "\"The Healing Power of Fascination: The Ancient Technique Unveiled\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, we are introduced to Prof. Erminio from Pisa, a master whose work takes the practice of hypnosis to new levels of healing. He regularly cures dozens of people each week, with most achieving lasting effects in a single session lasting just ten seconds. Prof. Erminio's forceful personality and use of astrological studies help him maintain balance with universal harmony. This technique, introduced to him by Prof. Caravelli, is as ancient as it is beneficial, and will be explored further in the second part of the book.",
  "content": "Even those who were most amenable to recurrent relapses, needed no more than 2 to 3 sessions before the beneficial effects of fascination accomplished through the look embedded themselves firmly in their organisms. Prof. Erminio was a person marked by a forceful personality. In his work methodology, as was the case with the ancient people, he always strove to be in a state of balance with the universal harmony, which he used to discern as a result of his astrological studies. It is thus from him that we have learnt how to employ this art for healing purposes. This is a technique that we are going to lay out in the second part of the book. Prof. Erminio, too, had been directly introduced to this discipline by an existing master: Prof. Caravelli. The latter was a masterful expert in the so-called art of “bi-location”, so much so that he could be simultaneously perceived in two different places. That is how we have made our acquaintance with this technique, which is as ancient as it is beneficial.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the technique of mental fascination through the power of the look is an ancient method that has been kept secret and handed down through the ages. With the guidance of Professor Erminio and his master Professor Caravelli, this technique has been revealed and can be used for healing purposes. The process is powerful and only requires a few sessions to achieve beneficial effects. With the information provided in the second part of this book, readers can learn how to employ this art and access the hidden keys that have remained unknown until now."
