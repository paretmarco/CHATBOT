  "title": "\"VITRIOLUM: Accessing the Inner Self for Well-being\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus shifts to VITRIOLUM, a concept from ancient alchemy that highlights the significance of accessing the interior part of ourselves for well-being. The text explains the meaning of interiora and the enteric part of the body in Latin. It also discusses the communication between the upper brain and the solar plexus, which is likened to a brain in reverse. The text emphasizes that the solar plexus is essential for maintaining balance and order in the body, and that the brain is not equipped to deal with bodily functions until they become very serious.",
  "content": "We could think to the solar plexus as a brain, but a brain in reverse, for in the brain the grey matter is on the outside and the white matter on the inside, whereas in the solar plexus it is the opposite. The grey matter which is composed of nerve cells makes it possible to think, while the white matter, composed of nerve fibres, makes it possible to feel. Thanks to its outer layer of white matter, therefore, the solar plexus can feel everything that goes on in the body, in every single cell, and is therefore able constantly to restore order and balance. The brain feels nothing at all until things have reached very serious proportions, and even then it doesn't know what to do about it. If your heart is beating too fast or too slowly, or if you have a stomach ache, the brain can do nothing about it and, what is more, that is not its job!",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and developing our solar plexus, we can unlock the amazing potential of our inner pharmacy, restore balance and order to our bodies, and truly achieve a deeper level of self-awareness. Don't underestimate the power of this often-overlooked center of our being, and start working on cultivating a strong and vibrant solar plexus today!"
