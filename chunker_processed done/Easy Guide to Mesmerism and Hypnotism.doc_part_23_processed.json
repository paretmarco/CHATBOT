  "title": "\"The Power and Potential Dangers of Hypnotism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, the author presents a series of experiments conducted by Jules Voisin to explore the effects of suggestion in hypnotism. These experiments demonstrate how the physiological effects of drugs and metals can be induced or eliminated by suggestion, and how changes in personality can also be induced through mental suggestion. These findings support the theory of hypnotism (as opposed to animal magnetism) and highlight the role that suggestion and imagination play in hypnotic phenomena. The author acknowledges their personal preference for animal magnetism but recognizes the influence of other factors.",
  "content": "Bourru and Butot, represents the last phase of a hysterical attack, a phase characterized by delirium with delusions, and lasting several months. Similar changes of personality, lasting only a short time, were observed in Somnambulism. They were always preceded by a physical change resembling an attack, and they were apparently induced, by any mental suggestion which accidentally recalled the previous existence of V.— [The italics are mine] The whole of these experiments are for the purpose of supporting. “The Theory of Suggestion—or Hypnotism as opposed to the Theory of Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism”. In the following pages the difference between Animal Magnetism and Hypnotism may be traced throughout every chapter belonging to the old school of Mesmerists. I have a weakness for Animal Magnetism as the primary operating agent in all mesmeric phenomena. At the same time, I have always known and recognised the influence of other agents or secondary causes, such as weariness of flesh and spirit, suggestion and imagination, made so much of nowadays by hypnotists.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the powers of mesmerism and hypnotism may offer effective solutions to alleviate pain and suffering, it is crucial for individuals to exercise caution when engaging with these practices. With the right knowledge and experience, these sciences can offer tremendous benefits, but they can also be dangerous in the wrong hands. It is essential to approach these techniques with care and to seek out qualified professionals who can guide you through the process safely."
