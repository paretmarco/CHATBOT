  "title": "The Science of Mesmerism: Understanding the Energetic Connection between Man and Nature.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, we are introduced to the concept of Animal Magnetism and how it relates to man's energetic connection with nature. Will power also plays a crucial role in this process, acting through both verbal and non-verbal channels. Dr. J. Coates Ph.D., an expert in Mesmerism, further explores this ancient and powerful technique, with the author providing modern commentary. This world of Animal Magnetism may seem intangible to some, but by keeping an open mind and learning more about it, we can experience and utilize it to impact others positively.",
  "content": "The idea of energy is also connected to the idea of “Will Power.” Even the most skilled hypnotists of today recognize the significance of “will power”. If I want something, if I’m totally congruent, then I can get it. The school of magnetism is strictly based on sheer will power. Will power acts not just through non-verbal channels, but also through energetic channels. We will now accompany you in the reading of the work of Dr. J. Coates. We will be at your side, commenting in a modern way, on some of his affirmations. In this way you will have two people, both practising the same technique, who span across the centuries. As Coates knew the most important mesmerists of his century, I can honestly say I searched out and have personally met the few remaining people who know this ancient and powerful technique. INTRODUCTION BY J COATES Ph.D. This work dealing with the science of Mesmerism is written by J. Coates, Ph.D., who says as follows—it is written in every-day language, and may limp a little here and there. For none of these faults do I offer an apology to my readers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of will can be a crucial element in achieving our goals and desires. Mesmerism, with its roots tracing back centuries, still has relevance today, especially with the recognition of energy channels. With the insights of Dr. J. Coates, Ph.D., and the personal encounters with some of the most successful Mesmerists, we can learn valuable lessons on this fascinating subject that no longer deserves to be sneered at."
