  "title": "\"Exploring Three Methods of Imposition and Magnetic Attraction\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author discussed three different methods of imposition of hands and their effects. In this final section, the author introduces \"Exercise n.4 – magnetic passes,\" which involves the person staring at a light before the operator performs magnetic passes to find areas of sensitivity to magnetic attraction. The text emphasizes the importance of practical experimentation and careful monitoring of results. The relevant concepts discussed include curative-passes, direct-passes, and magnetic attraction.",
  "content": "Three—Lay your hand on your Patient's Body, keep it there till very warm, then raise it very slowly, and (describe with your fingers a circle, the diameter of which should be equal to the length of your hand. Work this circle spirally from him to the distance of about one foot, and then draw your hand away, shaking it as after a Curative-pass. The effect is to remove pains and disease from the sick, but when it produces an exhausting sensation you have merely to make full Direct-passes over the spot. EXERCISE TO DISCOVER MAGNETISM Exercise n.4 – magnetic passes The operator asks the person to stare at the light for 20 '/ 30' seconds and then to close his eyes Then the operator performs magnetic passes: his palm hand goes down facing the person. The operator makes the same magnetic passes both on the front and on the sides of the person. The operator pays attention on what happens in the person's body dwelling on the areas where he feels more sensitivity to magnetic attraction.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetic passes can be a powerful tool in removing pains and diseases from a sick person's body. By following the steps of laying your hand on the patient's body till it's warm, raising it slowly, and spirally moving your hand from the patient to a distance of about one foot, you can help relieve the patient of their pains. However, if an exhausting sensation occurs, you can perform full direct passes over the spot. It's also important to pay attention to sensibility to attraction or magnetic attraction, a concept that can create a particular state in animals and humans alike."
