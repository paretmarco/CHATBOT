  "title": "\"Healing through Symbols and Group: Mesmer's Mesmeric Method\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this article, we delve into the mesmeric and symbolical method for healing as elaborated by F. A. Mesmer. This method involves utilizing symbols and forming a group to restore the individual to their true self. Symbols and other elements are used to enhance healing, while the group creates an energy field that facilitates consciousness change and can produce an \"egregore\" with an intrinsic capacity for healing. By examining quantum disciplines, we can understand how coherent concentration of attention can modify ondulatory fields for improved results. Overall, courses and assemblies remain powerful tools for healing and self-improvement.",
  "content": "Besides creating an environment which is more apt to produce a healing, a group likewise gives birth to a kind of energy field. Consciousness of the members get changed in a joint fashion. The group can reate what is called an “egregore”, that is, a form-thought with an intrinsic capacity to facilitate healing, which subsequently produces an impact on the individual subject as well. It is only possible to give an effective explanation of the said phenomenon by examining quantum disciplines. Coherent concentration of attention is capable of modifying the ondulatory fields that are the basis of our explicate reality. If more people act and think coherently results are enhanced. A group is moreover able to help the single persons who comprise it to learn on their own how to develop their potentialities. That explains why, even today, courses and assemblies can act as powerful tools of effecting healing and improvement.",
  "last_phrase": "Creating a healing environment is not only about physical factors, but also about the energy field generated by a group, which can facilitate healing and personal growth in individuals. This phenomenon can be explained through quantum disciplines and the coherent concentration of attention. Mesmer's invention of the bacquet highlights the importance of guided group conditions in healing. By embracing the idea that a healthy and inspiring environment is essential for well-being, we can promote holistic healing and improvement."
