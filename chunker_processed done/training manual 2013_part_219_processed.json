  "title": "\"The Third Eye: A Link Between Physiology and Intuition\"",
  "first_phrase": "The pineal gland is related to intuition and the third eye, a concept shared by many traditions. Dr. Lefebure observed that the third eye corresponds to a position where normal vision is suspended, leading to an amplification of consciousness. The triangle and the third eye are often linked in symbolism, with the triangle representing fire, the element with the highest level of vibration. The third eye, also known as ajna chakra, is present as a perceptive center in humans but is usually in a state of slumber.",
  "content": "According to many traditions, such a third eye is also portrayed as being contained inside a triangle which functions as a symbol of fire as well. Fire is in fact the element endowed with the highest level of vibration 57. This link between the triangle and the eye is similarly present, in Europe, in both medieval and renaissance iconography, in terms of which the eye, often inserted within a triangle, was after all seen as an explicit image of the trinity. We find a similar symbolism in the East, where Buddha (often called \"the eye of the world\") is represented in the form of a triangle known as Tiratna or threefold gem. It is important to understand that such an intuitive center or third eye, though already quite present as perceptive centre in man, and recognized by for instance the Indians as ajna chakra, is nevertheless in a state of slumber in most cases.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the third eye or intuitive center, represented by a triangle and linked to the element of fire, is a metaphorical concept deeply rooted in many traditions around the world. Its development and potential activation require the release of mental blocks and the opening up of intuition, which varies from person to person. Hypnotic practices often use this area as a means to facilitate the task of letting go of oneself and inducing hypnosis."
