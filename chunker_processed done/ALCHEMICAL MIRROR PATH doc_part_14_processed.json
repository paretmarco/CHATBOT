  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the first two stages of the transformational process through which an individual has the ability to exist in multiple planes of reality. In the third stage, known as lucid dreaming in the waking state, the individual becomes aware of two realities at the same time, beyond their normal ego and thoughts. This state requires overcoming the risk of vertigo and being carried away by the flow of dreams. Those who successfully reach this stage can navigate between the two modes of being, leaving their physical body in a state of apparent death to live another life and then regain conscious awareness of their primitive state. Various techniques can be used to achieve this state, but the force of impression must be managed and directed towards the ultimate purpose.",
  "content": "In fact, passing beyond the threeshold of this \"death\" they may, after a barrage of trials, get even used to the vertigo itself and not suffer it, rather almost no notice at all, and therefore lead with perfect lucidity the gap between the two modes of being, leaving the physical body in a state of apparent death to live another life, and then regain consciously the primitive state. You will stay on two worlds at the same time. Note, the same results can be reached by other means, including where, for example, the rotation of the head at an angle, the breathing performed with particular rhythm, they can also be used certain reactions of sexual union, feelings of love, etc.. the latter methods are not advisable to apply for the rapid dangerous violence, not allowing a gradual development of control (in alchemy they are called \"corrosive waters\") In all these ways, however, you must be able to direct the force that is impression for your purpose. Strange phenomena are occurring at perception in the course of these experiments.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, with the right techniques, it is possible to transcend the physical body and experience a new mode of being through conscious detachment. While this process can be daunting, it can be approached with curiosity and control. It is important to remember that precaution and gradual development of control are essential, and certain methods should be avoided due to their potentially dangerous nature."
