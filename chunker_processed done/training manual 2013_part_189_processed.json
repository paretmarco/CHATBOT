  "title": "\"The Power of Music and Magnetic Ecstasy Techniques\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we learned how music can enhance results, and about the therapeutic goal of Magnetic Ecstasy technique – to develop a more detached view of the world by directing energy towards the brain and quieting the senses. Now, let's dive into the two phases of the technique, starting with the sealing of the senses and crossed passes, followed by the ecstasy phase where magnetic passes are done from the third eye to the center of the head. We also get insights on how this technique can be used to help people relax and heal during a therapeutic session.",
  "content": "Let the subject looks at a light (optional) Close his senses working with downward passes from his head ears (as you were moulding them) nose eyes You can use this state to give him a wellness and healing suggestion Bring the person to the present Magnetic passes – crossed at the heart Make cross passes downwards from the shoulders to the hips PHASE 2 - Ecstasy Magnetic passes – Head Do magnetic passes from the third eye to the center of the head (crown chakra in Yoga) NOTE : this exercise is very similar to the Pi Quan exercise used in ch’an to develop presence to a wider dimension or to the exercises for bringing the “sun in the saturn”. The practitioner should practice before on himself these exercises and get the “feeling” of it before attempting this one. 2.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the eye is remarkable, and through simple exercises like downward passes and magnetic passes, one can tap into this power to achieve a state of wellness and healing. However, it is crucial to practice on oneself before attempting to fascinate others and bring the \"sun in the saturn.\" Remember, the eye has a potent influence, so use it wisely and ethically."
