  "title": "The Relationship Between Space and Thought: An Exploration",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored how changing the phase of inner space can affect the existence of thoughts and feelings. In Chapter 9, we will dive into Time, but for now, let's delve into what happens when internal state changes with space. Noted Sufi Master Idries Shah emphasizes that the property of the system, both internal and external loses its power if the space or time is changed. This exercise is part of The Tao of Chaos (Exercise #6), where we explore the phase of space that our thoughts or feelings occupy, and how switching that space can alter our existence.",
  "content": "Notice what happens. If you recall in Quantum Consciousness what Einstein had demonstrated, that \"everything is made of emptiness and that form is condensed emptiness,\" then the thought would only be able to occupy a particular space. Why? Because it is made of that space. If you move it to another space, the space would not be able to hold it. Therefore the thought or feeling would disappear. Why? Because the thought or feeling is condensed emptiness and can only exist in a very specific phase of space. Since the space and the thought or feeling are one, separating the thought or feeling from the space dismantles it and hence it has no space to exist in. Space: the unlimited or indefinitely great receptacle of things, commonly conceived as an expanse extending in all directions (or having three dimensions), in which, or occupying portions of which, all material objects are located) Space has been, and will probably continue to be, one of the most intriguing areas of human existence. Our individual mind finds it incomprehensible to imagine space going on forever, not to mention having no beginning, middle or end. Space, as with energy, gets defined and limited.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our understanding of space is limited by our human minds, but it is important to acknowledge that everything, including our thoughts and feelings, exist within a specific phase of space. By recognizing the interconnectedness of space and our existence, we can better navigate the boundaries and definitions we create for ourselves and our surroundings. Notice what happens when we expand our understanding and embrace the infinite possibilities of space."
