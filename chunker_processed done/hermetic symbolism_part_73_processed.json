  "title": "The Illusion of Self: Alchemical Symbols and the Nature of \"I\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, we delve into the concept of the \"I\" as a phenomenon of interference, rather than an objective entity. The author discusses the illusionary nature of the self-consciousness and how it is a mental trick of our minds. Before this, the text explores the alchemical symbols used to evoke complex ideas, particularly the two hieroglyphs that represent the descent of the Divine Essence into the soul and the ascent of infernal Fire made divine by purification. The Empress is also touched upon, who points the vessel downwards to catch mist rising from the earth and converting it into ideas by virtue of the cross.",
  "content": "It is necessary to meditate on these two figures, the hieroglyphs representing the descent of the Divine Essence into the purified soul and the ascent of the infernal Fire, which is made divine by the fulfilment of its task of purification. The Personality19 Self-consciousness produces the feeling of the \"I\". Each one of us feels himself as owner of a domain which belongs exclusively to him. The I, as God reigns on what it thinks is its own But , is our I a being , an objective entity ? Contrary to current opinion, the \"I\" is nothing by itself , it is just a phenomenon of interference , a mental optical illusion . It should therefore come to say \"I know that I am nothing ,\" in the same way as Socrates said : \"I know that I know nothing .\" But if the individual I is an illusion as actual spiritual essence of effective objectivity, nevertheless exists in a way similar to a concentration chamber , where the intellectual rays entering our psychic sphere are refracted.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while our sense of \"I\" is not an objective entity, but rather a mental illusion formed from various factors, it remains an integral part of our being. Though we cannot be certain of its persistence beyond our physical existence, the intuitive belief in the indestructibility of life offers hope for its continuation in some form. Ultimately, by meditating on the descent and ascent of the Divine Essence, we can strive for purification and transcendence of the limitations of our individual \"I\"."
