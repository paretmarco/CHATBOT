  "title": "\"The Ordering of Chaos: Steps 3 and 4 in the Development of a Unified Field Theory of Human Behavior.\"",
  "first_phrase": "The third and fourth step of personal growth are often overlooked in psychology. Step three teaches individuals to recognize their own order within chaos, while step four is about the discovery of self. Chapter 1 introduced the idea that chaos has its own order, and in this section, the concept of \"attractors\" within chaos theory is introduced. These \"valleys\" of energy serve as a form of order in chaotic systems. However, the habitual repetition of patterns to seek order can move us further away from our true selves. Therapists must help clients recognize their own energy patterns and realize their own order in chaos to aid in self-discovery.",
  "content": "For example, a child might learn to control her anger energy and turn it into a smile (valley) to order the chaos of an abusive parent, rather than yell at the mother which would appear as a hill. This attraction to order causes repetitive patterns which later in life move us further away from ourselves rather than closer. In other words, our chronic habit of hiding our feelings behind a smile moves us further away from our true self rather than closer to our true self. In the above example, the child organizes and orders the anger energy into a smile to get closer to Mom. In the future, this attempt becomes habitual and rather than the chaos of anger being used to bring us closer to connection, we feel habitually more disconnected because we have to hide our true feelings behind a smile. In order to do this it becomes the task of the energy pack- ________________ age called therapist to offer ways and means for the client to recognize their own energy pattern or to teach the energy package of client to realize their own order in chaos so as to develop a better understanding of who they are.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to break free from the chronic habit of hiding our true feelings behind a smile, it is important to recognize and understand our own energy patterns. A therapist can guide us in this process and teach us how to observe and become aware of the order within the chaos of our emotions. With this new understanding, we can discover our true selves and reconnect with others in a more authentic way. Remember, awareness is the key to recognizing our own energy patterns and unlocking our true potential."
