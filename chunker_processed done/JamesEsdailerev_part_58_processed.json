  "title": "\"Somnambulism and Magnetic Ecstasy: Understanding Human Nature and Attributes\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the fascinating phenomenon of somnambulism and its implications for understanding the nature of human consciousness and spirituality. According to M. Deleuze, somnambulism is a direct proof of the spirituality of the soul and the twofold existence of the inward man in a single individual. The text also delves into magnetic ecstasy, where the mind simply contemplates and becomes more absorbed, and the athanor, a symbol of the human organism in which the great work of regeneration is effected. The concept of the three tan tien is explored, and a connection is made to the pituitary gland and the thalamus, suggesting that in magnetism one can attain an expanded state of consciousness.",
  "content": "An ancient Western tradition is represented by the athanor. The athanor is a three-tier oven, and it is the symbol of the human organism in which the great work of regeneration is effected.20 The three-tier symbol21 is the same as the Eastern concept of the three tan tien, which differentiates between three areas of the body (cinnabar fields), corresponding to the area of the navel, the heart and the head.22 In the Chinese tradition, one finds a manner of operating which gradually ascends from the lower to the higher tan tien. In magnetism we can equally bring energy to the top of head. We create in this way what is called “magnetic ecstasy”. Physiologically this point of the body (also called ‘vertex’) could be envisioned somewhat connected to the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones to communicate to the rest of the endocrine system and also connects to the central nervous system via the hypothalamus. The thalamus is thought to have a key role in the physical basis of consciousness. In magnetism we can do the same and get to expanded state of consciousness.. The results depend on practice. Music can enhance results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ancient Western tradition represented by the athanor and the Chinese concept of the three tan tien have similarities in the way they operate in gradually ascending from the lower to higher levels. In magnetism, it is possible to reach an expanded state of consciousness by bringing energy to the top of the head, which is connected to the pituitary gland and thalamus. Practicing this technique with music can lead to incredibly restoring and peaceful experiences, and the theories of Puysegur suggest that somnambulism can be produced through the diffusion of electric fluid."
