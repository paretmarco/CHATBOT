  "title": "\"Understanding Mesmerism, Hypnotism, and Emotional Change Through Words\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the connection between words, emotions, and hypnosis. The first part delves into how the use of certain words can cause emotional shifts. The next section differentiates between Mesmerism, where physiological changes lead to emotional changes, and hypnotism, where the hypnotist's willpower and expectancy play a significant role. This last section provides a historical example of how these ideas manifest in the figure of Abbe Faria, who didn't believe in magnetic fluid but incorporated hypnotic techniques. Overall, the text establishes a foundation for understanding the relationship between language, physiology, and hypnosis.",
  "content": "Even animals are able to enter in states called “animal hypnosis.” Animals will not react on words; they will react on SPECIFICAL NON VERBAL STIMULATIONS. NON VERBAL STIMULATIONS Archetypal (genetically encoded): gaze reaction, touch etc… Learned: animals can learn new stimulations which will bring them in hypnosis easier. What we mean by “Hypnotism” Hypnotism, as described by Coates, is something different from modern hypnosis. It is a state in which we can observe many phenomena that we don’t observe in communicational modern hypnosis. Furthermore, something is not said. In Coates’ time, the preparation of the hypnotist gave a lot of importance to the expectancy and will power of the hypnotist. In other words, even the operator should concentrate and be monoideistic. However, we know from other works that these are the same conditions required for generating the “fluid”. In this way we have another state, in some way intermediary between “Mesmerism” and “Modern Hypnosis.” A clear example is Abbe Faria. Abbe Faria didn’t believe in the magnetic fluid.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal hypnosis is a real and fascinating state that can be induced through specific nonverbal stimuli, both archetypal and learned. In terms of hypnotism, Coates' description of the hypnotic state differs from modern understandings, with the hypnotist's willpower and concentration playing a crucial role. The power of suggestion, expectation, and confidence cannot be underestimated in inducing hypnosis, and the debate regarding the use and existence of the \"life fluid\" continues to this day."
