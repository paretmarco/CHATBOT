  "title": "\"Experiences in Magnetism: Laying of Hands Technique Explained\"",
  "first_phrase": "The previous section details the magnetizer's initial phases while performing magnetic practices to heal others. In this final section, the author highlights the similarities between these practices and ancient initiations, exploring the deeper meaning behind the preparation and isolation required in both. The author, unnamed, shares these insights in the booklet \"Laying of Hands\" and describes how the magnetizer enters a state of exaltation, akin to the state Paracelsus sought to achieve in his extraordinary cures.",
  "content": "Naturally, at this point it is natural to lift the head, and let go one of the two hands of the sick person.” “In this first part, the magnetizer is passive. It is the negative pole of a force that he draws toward him. Occultists could say that he call forth the \"astral light\" from which become saturated, to get, in this case, in a state of exaltation, as he was drunk, similar, without any doubt, to the state that serached to attain Paracelsus as he realized his marvelous cures.” We can see a similitude between this first part and the first part of some ancient initiations, the apprentice phase. You must concentrate on yourself and being isolated from everything around you. In allegorical terms it means go away from the prophan world and enter in the temple.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism therapy can be a powerful tool in restoring the balance and harmony in a sick organism. By concentrating on oneself, isolating from the world, and tapping into the astral light, a magnetizer can create a magnetic field that treats the patient's illness. With practice and experience, magnetizers can diagnose and locate the root of the problem, and just rely on the forces accumulated to restore health."
