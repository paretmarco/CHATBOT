By undertaking personal experimentation, the author believes that medical professionals will be better equipped to appreciate the potential of Mesmerism fully.",
  "content": "He encourages his professional brethren thus:- \"I have never seen, nor have any of my acquaintance ever seen, any bad effect accompany or follow operations performed during the magnetic sleep, of which the influence is essentially strengthening instead of being depressing. It fortifies the patient for the operation, secures him from pain during its performance, and facilitates his recovery, inasmuch as it admits of the wound being dressed without pain. It is the best and most prompt sedative when he suffers from local pains, for the system becomes very sensitive during convalescence from serious operations, and a few â€˜passes` often act in a more speedy and efficacious manner in procuring sleep and alleviating pain than the most powerful narcotics.\" To surgeons he says:- \"In surgery, the benefits of Mesmerism are not confined to the extinction of pain during an operation, but are of the greatest general and particular advantage in the after treatment of surgical diseases.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism or magnetic sleep has been proven to be a powerful tool in the medical field, capable of reducing pain during surgery and aiding in the recovery of surgical diseases. It is an effective sedative and has the potential to treat mental illnesses such as epilepsy and insanity.
