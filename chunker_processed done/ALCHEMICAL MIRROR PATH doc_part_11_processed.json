  "title": "\"Visions and Dreams in Fluidic Level: Exploring Perception and Beyond\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author described the first stage of fluidic visions, where the operator could observe auras and energies around physical objects. However, the second stage takes us into a new dimension known as \"the waters,\" where the operator can achieve communication and vision of distant people. By intensely focusing on their image, the outline appears in the mirror, even of people in the past or future. The figures do not speak, but the operator experiences their vibrations. As the vision progresses, a complete darkness envelops the operator's consciousness.",
  "content": "Focusing intensely the thoughts on the image of a person will soon draw in the outlines of it in the mirror, until, becoming more precise, it will show up in the way in which our thought create it, or even as it is in the moment of the experiment (that in this case we could call of far sight). By the same process it is easy to recall past events, as well as having a clear vision of the future. It is important to note that the figures mentioned do not speak, which is very obvious, but the operator has clear conscience, and it is as he could feel the vibrations of the words inside. You can easily see your body or the body of imagined people almost like a mass of a dark gray, more intense here and there, surrounded entirely by a band of slightly brighter light. The vision of the more or less rapid varying degrees of lights and colours ends with the perception of a complete darkness where the conscience of the operator seems. to dissolve.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of focused thoughts can lead to extraordinary experiences of recalling the past, visualizing the future, and even creating entities in the present. However, it is important to be mindful of the potential hallucinations and dangers that may arise along the path. Continuously persisting and staying firm is the key to unlocking the wonders of this new world without getting lost in it."
