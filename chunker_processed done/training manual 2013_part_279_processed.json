Now, let's explore three more exercises that can help in strengthening and improving focus. Exercise 11, called Necklace, involves counting the grains of amber or glass necklaces without any disturbances. In the absence of a necklace, beans or hazelnuts can also be used. Exercise 12, Thumbs, requires shooting the right thumb on the left one isochronously while keeping the mind focused. Exercise 13, Fists Closed, involves opening each finger slowly and paying attention to its motion.",
  "content": "The Indians, to whom this exercise is familiar, not infrequently count many thousands of grains not minding about what is happening around them and without diverting mind on other thoughts. In the absence of a necklace, you can practice to count, in the manner above described, dried beans, hazelnuts, etc. Exercise 12. Thumbs. Sit, cross your fingers and start shooting right thumb on the left with isochronous. The exercise consists in keep your mind focused on what you are doing without ever diverting it.
