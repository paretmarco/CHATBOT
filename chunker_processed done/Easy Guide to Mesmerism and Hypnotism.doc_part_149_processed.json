  "title": "Guide to Mesmerizing Patients through Hand Contact and Directed Passes.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the importance of confidence and decisiveness in the mesmerism process was emphasized, stating that a patient should instinctively feel that the mesmerist can be trusted. In this last portion, the method to mesmerize is described in detail. The process includes calmly and steadily exercising your will towards the desired end of sleep while making physical contact with the patient through easy handholding and placing your hands on the patient's head for several minutes. This process, like others, can result in peculiar sensations such as drowsiness that should not be resisted.",
  "content": "Next, for five minutes or so, take hold of his hands in an easy, comfortable manner, or he can place his hands upon his knees, and you can lay yours with a just perceptible physical pressure on the top of them. Remain thus in contact until there is no apparent difference in temperature between your hands and his. Direct your eyes to his, or, rather, to the organ of “Individuality,” or that portion of the head just situated between the two eyebrows, at the root of the nose. Exercise your will calmly and steadfastly towards the desired end—sleep. Gradually remove your hands from his, and place them on his head for two or three minutes, covering his forehead at each temple with the hollow of your hand, with fingers resting on head and your thumbs converging towards “Individuality,”—Slight pressure with the hands on the temples is desirable, as it tends to heck the inflow of blood to the head per the temporal arteries.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these simple steps can help you achieve a peaceful and relaxing sleep. By gently connecting with another person and calmly directing your will through physical touch and passes, you can promote a state of restful slumber. Give it a try and see how it works for you."
