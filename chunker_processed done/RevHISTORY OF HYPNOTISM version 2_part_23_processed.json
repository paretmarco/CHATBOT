  "content": "Georges Sandby, In “Mesmerism and its Opponents” Georges Sandby describes his own personal experiences with animal magnetism and their influence on his opinion of the genuineness of the phenomena. Using cases from the mesmeric literature, he emphasizes both the benefits of and potential dangers of animal magnetic practice, emphasizing the need to counter superstitious attitudes in those who participate. Sandby also suggests techniques for the use of magnetizers Colquhoun, with Isis Revelata Colquhoun was an ardent partisan of animal magnetism. He attempted to show that just as with many great scientific discoveries (Galileo, Harvey, etc.) in its early stages animal magnetism had been linked in the minds of its critics with magic and superstition and rejected by the scientific establishment. As these discoveries proved to be of great benefit to mankind, so will it be with animal magnetism. To substantiate this view, Colquhoun ranges through the history of the rise and development of animal-magnetic practices, harking back now and again to analogous phenomena in previous eras of history. Ashburner, A London physician, and a friend of John Elliotson who wrote articles for Elliotson’s mesmeric journal, the Zoist. Ashburner had become convinced of the reality of animal magnetism in the 1840s.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, studying the experiences and techniques described by writers on animal magnetism, and reading biographies of healers, can provide valuable insights into the benefits and potential dangers of these practices. As evidenced by the success stories of King Hussein of Jordan and Shimon Peres, modern magnetic healers like Vincenzo Campanelli can also be effective in helping individuals overcome ingrained behaviors like smoking. Whether seeking to understand the rationale behind hypnotism or seeking relief through magnetic healing, learning from the experiences and knowledge of these writers can prove invaluable."
