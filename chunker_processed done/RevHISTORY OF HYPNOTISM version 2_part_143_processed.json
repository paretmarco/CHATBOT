  "title": "\"Magnetism and Healing: Exploring De Puysegur's Legacy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the origin and history of animal magnetism as a healing treatment. Now, we will explore the observation made by Alphonse Didier de Puysegur and his successors regarding the ability of magnetized individuals to self-select their treatment for illnesses. Additionally, we will discuss the innate capacity of primates, including humans, to find what can heal them. We can use this capacity in hypnotherapy to help people find their own solutions. The text also mentions that magnetic healing works not only on humans but also on animals, as exemplified by the Comte de Puységur's healing of a dog. Finally, we will delve into developing somnambulistic faculties.",
  "content": "There was no public exhibition, nothing was done to strike the imagination; there was no selection of subjects from among silly or melancholic women. The patients of the marquis were patients of both sexes of the peasant class, and were often suffering from severe and obstinate diseases. In fact this kind of treatment worked even on animals. Magnetism on Animals For example, the Comte de Puységur, brother of the Marquis de Puységur, was second in command of the Regiment of Languedoc when he practiced animal magnetism to heal a dog which had been injured by an angry soldier. The Comte de Puységur approached the animal, which seemed to be barely alive, and applied magnetic passes. The dog was restored to good health in the space of a few minutes. This seems to be one of the first examples in the literature of animal magnetism of the application of magnetic healing to an animal79. Even Deleuze observed that a dog that had been previously magnetized for some slight pains, came back, and by its demeanour seemed to require the same remedy.80 Developing the Somnambulistic Faculties.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism and somnambulism have been proven to be effective in treating both humans and animals alike. Magnetic ecstasy is another fascinating magnetic phenomenon that warrants further exploration. These discoveries shed light on the spirituality of the soul and the distinct existence of two substances in a single individual, serving as evidence that man is an intelligence served by organs."
