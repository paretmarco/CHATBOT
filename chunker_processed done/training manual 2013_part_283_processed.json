  "content": "You can easily use any page of this book, but it will be better to use a book that you are not familiar with and even better if you never read it. Put the book away as usual to read extensively and focus at the pinhead. These done, try to see as many words as you can, close to pinhead, without moving even for an instant your eyes from the point above mentioned. At this moment, you will feel an almost irresistible desire to direct your gaze on the words themselves, but do not support it. Imprint in your mind the words as they appear and when you have sent to memory every word possible within the radius of your vision without moving the gaze, close your eyes quickly and write on a piece of paper the words memorized. Later you can check this list confronting it with the words on the page where the needle was plunged and if you do not match will be a sign that you were not be following exactly the prescriptive instructions and it would be good to repeat the exercise.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises can help improve both memory and focus. By using unfamiliar texts and learning to see without counting, we can train our minds to work more efficiently and effectively. Try these exercises regularly to see an improvement in your mental performance."
