  "title": "Ancient Healing Practices: Prophets, Dreams, and Laying of Hands",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author delves into the practices of seers and prophets in ancient Israel, including dreaming and visions, divination, and the laying of hands for healing. The author notes that while such practices were accepted in ancient times, they are often dismissed by modern-day practitioners of Christianity, who attribute healing solely to imagination or suggestion. In the last 200 words, the author offers examples from the Bible of miraculous healings by Jesus and his followers and argues that such healings had no occult basis, but were the result of the faith and expectation of the individuals involved. The text challenges readers to consider the role of faith and expectation in the healing process.",
  "content": "His wishes through the seer, but He communicated with man during dreams and in the visions of the night, to warm “man of the evil he doeth, and to instruct him on the way he should know.” “Healing by the laying on of the hands was common among the Jews, and was practised by the Founder of Christianity and His immediate followers with marvellous results. ''Many were astonished that such mighty works were wrought by His hands” {Mark vi, 2). “Lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover”' (Mark xvi. 18). “The Lord granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands” (Acts xiv. 3). As illustrative of what I wish to point out in the light of modern science—held in consistently by professing Christians.—Naaman, if cured, was cured by imagination or suggestion, while the cures of Christ and the apostles are placed in the category of effects which had no occult basis other than in the '“dominant idea” of the “operator” and the “expectancy” of the subject.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of hands-on healing has been a practice that dates back centuries, with evidence from ancient Greek and Jewish cultures. Even in modern times, this healing method is still applied and has proven to be effective. It is worth considering the power of suggestion and the dominant idea in the cure of illnesses. A simple touch can sometimes be enough to bring comfort and relief to those in pain."
