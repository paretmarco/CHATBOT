  "title": "\"Magnetism and Somnambulism: The Influence on Quantum Mechanics\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Abbot G.B. Loubert's observations on magnetism and somnambulism were discussed, including the ability of a magnetized person to perceive and describe distant individuals' sicknesses or conditions. Loubert notes that a somnambulist's heightened nervous sensibility allows them to react with superior vividness to sensory stimuli. These findings had a profound impact on Schopenhauer and the German Naturphilosophie, later influencing the development of quantum theory. This last section of the text notes how this research not only led to new healing practices but also came full circle to connect to human understanding through works like Fritjoff Capra's \"The Tao of Physics.\"",
  "content": "At that stage, in fact, the soul of such person might turn into a faithful interpreter of the things he examines, the presence of which stirs up his sensibility, regardless of whether such examined things come from his body or from that of another person, or even from medicinal substances. In this regard, he frequently provides anatomical descriptions characterized by thorough exactitude». These effects transcending the senses made a strong impression on Schopenhauer and the German “Naturphilosophie” (Natural philosophy), which in turn influenced those German and Danish experts of physics who, as is the case of Bohr and Schroedinger, lie at the root of modern quantum theory. In essence, these experiments opened up the way not only to new therapeutic dynamics, but even to the research which lead to quantum mechanics, the same which, in its last phase, through such works as Fritjoff Capra’s “The Tao of Physics”, comes back to man, thereby bringing a perfect circle to completion.",
  "last_phrase": "The research conducted by AFEM revealed intriguing findings and opened up new avenues of inquiry, particularly in the realm of psychokinetic action and magnetic factors. Through these experiments, we have gained valuable insights that can help us not only in achieving success but also in understanding the mysteries of the universe from quantum mechanics to the nature of the human soul."
