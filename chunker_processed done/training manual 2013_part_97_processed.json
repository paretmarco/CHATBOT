  "title": "\"The Power of Passes: Communicating Beyond Words for Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve deeper into the primal nature of passes and how they can heal beyond words. By going beyond the division between internal and external, we can tap into a primal mind that can only be spoken to through physical actions like passes. We also explore how passes change the mental state of the operator and make them more sensitive to the subject. It's important to remember to always be aware and feel the client while doing passes.",
  "content": "Most of the time can be done at a distance. Therefore, we have to focus the attention outside the body for having a wider dimension. 3. Passes speak to a primal mind in a physical way, the only one that our primal mind understands We cannot easily ask (with word ) our non rational mind to act in a direction, rather we can ask it through the movement (such as touching) and through physical actions. In further details, by passes we can activate also our enteric brain, that works in our body like a second brain. 4. Passes change also the mental state of the operator and make him more sensible to the subject. As we don’t operate physically, we must change our way of doing and thinking. Therefore, we go in a new reality, the “trance reality”, where healing is possible. IMPORTANT SECRET: since you do passes, remember always to feel your client and the action of them. Be aware. 5.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning and practicing passes can be an effective way to activate our primal minds, change our mental state, and concentrate our will. By focusing our attention outside the body, we can access a wider dimension and enter a trance reality where healing is possible. Remember to be aware of your client and their actions and to understand the subtle energy that is present everywhere to effectively practice animal magnetism."
