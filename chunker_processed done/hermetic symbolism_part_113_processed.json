  "title": "\"The Royal Art: Spiritual Achievement of Self-Transformation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author delves deeper into the concept of spiritual royalty. They argue that true artists are not mystics who have lost their heads, but rather individuals who have sacrificed their selfish desires and conquered their radical egoism. By doing so, they free themselves from the tyranny of selfish instincts and become lords of everything, drawing their will solely from divine intentions. This marriage of the spirit incarnate and the divine princess takes effect when one's volition becomes sacred. The immediate objective is the preparation of Philosophical Gold, which symbolizes individual perfection. To achieve this, one must seek refuge from personal disturbances, seek tranquillity, and purify themselves through tests of initiation.",
  "content": "It takes effect in us when our own volition becomes sacred, when we as Sons of the Father take up the paternal cause, dedicating ourselves to the Great Work of creation. Because the true Great Work is that which has been going on since the beginning of time itself. It is the Redeeming Work which gives rise to evolution, to progress, to the coordination of chaos and the construction of a better human race. The immediate objective is the preparation of Philosophical Gold, the symbol of the perfection that each individual may realize. Every one of us can carry out the transmutation of bad into good within their own selves if, once their consciousness has been enlightened, they act accordance with what it tells them to do. What is it that is asked of us? That we learn to know ourselves in the midst of the confusion wrought by the personal disturbances pertaining to all individuals. That we seek tranquillity and seek to refocus ourselves. If a refuge is offered to us, that we take it. That we leave the hubbub behind and enter inside ourselves: that we then submit to the tests of initiation and work to fully purify ourselves.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, the Great Work of creation is the ultimate objective of our existence, and it starts with the transmutation of our own selves. We must seek to know ourselves, seek inner peace, and follow our consciousness to achieve purity. By recognizing our concrete task and performing it religiously, even in a small way, we contribute to this work, producing the gold of our own virtues that benefits everyone around us. Let us strive to be both human and divine, carrying out our part in this eternal process."
