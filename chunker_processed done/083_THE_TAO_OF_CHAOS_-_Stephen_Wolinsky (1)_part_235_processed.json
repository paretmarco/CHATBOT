  "title": "The Importance of Uncovering Self-Deception in Relationships",
  "first_phrase": "In this therapy session, the therapist helps the client uncover the lies they told themselves about their partner Bill. By addressing self-deception, the client can avoid feeling like a victim and empower themselves to change. The fallacy of change, a thinking distortion in cognitive therapy, suggests that people often lie to themselves about who their partners are to try and fill their internal void. By acknowledging and addressing these lies, clients can focus on changing themselves rather than manipulating others.",
  "content": "To empower ourself, the lies we tell ourself must be uncovered first. To explain further, most people feel empty inside. To resist the emptiness they lie to themselves about the people they are in relationship with. In short, they try to get others to fill their emptiness, and lie to themselves about who people are so that the imagined, made-up person will fill the empty space. Later, they lie that they lied to themselves, and then get angry and try to change their partner. This is called the fallacy of change and is considered a thinking distortion in cognitive therapy. \"The only person you can really control or have much hope of changing is yourself. The fallacy of Change, however, assures that other people will change to suit you, if you just pressure them enough. Your attention and energy are therefore focused on others because your hope for happiness lies in getting others to meet your needs.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To truly empower ourselves, we must first confront the lies we tell ourselves and resist the fallacy of change, which convinces us to focus our attention and energy on others instead of ourselves. By recognizing and addressing our own thoughts and feelings of emptiness, we can begin to fill that void through self-improvement and self-care. So if you're feeling empty inside, take some time to introspect, nurture yourself, and seek professional help if needed to ensure a brighter, more fulfilling future."
