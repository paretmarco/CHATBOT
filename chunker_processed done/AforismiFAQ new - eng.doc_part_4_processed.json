  "title": "\"The Importance of Acknowledging Gifts from the Universe\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we learned about the importance of acknowledging and welcoming the gifts that the Universe bestows upon us, with Magnetism being one of them. This last part delves deeper into the relationship between the body, energy, and the self. It includes aphorisms from various sources, such as Puysegur, on the body and the non-verbal nature of the self, and describes how magnetism is born when we have a surplus of nervous potential. It also discusses the importance of not thinking and focusing on doing, as well as the role of vitality in magnetism. Lastly, it emphasizes the value of being present and aware to feel the natural energy around us, as searching for something that is innate to us is unnecessary.",
  "content": "Other Aphorisms More aphorisms on the subject of “not thinking” Thinking is the activity of the exterior self. It ends up being no more than an inner dialogue which delays and conceals the self-perception which, on the contrary, knows what to do and how to do it It is preferable not to think and to do One would do better to concentrate on doing than on doing well Aphorisms on Energy Energy is natural. What is unnatural is not to feel it, but the truth is that modern man lives an unnatural life and must therefore learn how to feel it all over again The wise man is the master of his own attention, just as the undeveloped man is its slave Magnetism is linked to a surplus of vitality. A 70 year old man might have greater vitality than a youth of 20 Whoever searches shall not find, and whoever finds searches for nothing Energy is. Whoever lacks knowledge searches around, but he is foolish, as he cannot see in front of his nose. Accordingly, he finds nothing, and will never find anything by searching. Whoever finds is in no need of searching.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these aphorisms remind us of the importance of accessing our essential inward being and concentrating on doing rather than overthinking. They also highlight the naturalness of energy and the need to learn how to feel it once again. Ultimately, we should focus on non-verbal reality and strive for less rather than more in our pursuit of self-mastery."
