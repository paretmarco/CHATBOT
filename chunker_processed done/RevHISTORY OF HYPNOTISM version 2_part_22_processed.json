  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the article reflected on the history of hypnotism and Mesmer Hypnosis, which has been overlooked compared to its derivative, animal magnetism. The piece emphasized the importance of researching and understanding multiple paths in hypnosis, including those outlined by Braid, Fahnstock, Sunderland, Bods, and Mesmerists. In this concluding section, the author suggests reading some of the works found on Gallica.fr and Google Books. The article mentioned the names of authors such as William Gregory, Chauncy Hare Townshend, Deleuze, and Du Potet, who have contributed to the field of Mesmerism.",
  "content": "Here are the names of some authors: William Gregory, with: Letters to a Candid Inquirer, on Animal Magnetism. Gregory, a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh and a well-respected scientist, was an enthusiastic supporter of animal magnetism. In this book he gives a clear description of the mesmeric state and the relationship between the magnetizer and magnetized. He discusses both the ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ phenomena of mesmerism and describes many cases illustrating both. Townshend, Chauncy Hare, with: Facts in Mesmerism with Reasons for a Dispassionate Inquiry into It. Townshend, a clergyman of the Church of England, was one of the most articulate British writers on animal magnetism. This book went through many editions in Britain and the United States, and it proved to be very influential in making animal magnetism a legitimate subject of interest. Deleuze with “Practical Instructions for the study of Animal Magnetism. Du Potet with: Introduction to the study of Animal magnetism Du Potet was a powerful magnetizer, and travelled to many cities giving lectures on Mesmerism.",
  "last_phrase": "In short, these authors played a significant role in the study and promotion of animal magnetism during the 19th century. Their works provide valuable insights into the theory and practice of mesmerism and helped pave the way for its acceptance as a legitimate subject of inquiry. By reading their books, we can gain a deeper understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and its potential benefits and dangers."
