  "title": "\"The Three Phases of the Philosophers' Stone Work\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the following text, the author discusses the Work of the Wise or the creation of the Philosophers’ Stone through three phases. The central idea revolves around the purification of salt, the coagulation of mercury, and the fixation of sulfur. The author also emphasizes the importance of finding the right material and purifying it before enclosing it in the hermetically sealed Philosophical Egg. The subject, upon dying, is split into two parts, leaving behind a residue with endless possibilities. The author delves deeper into the idea of transmutation and turning the ordinary into something extraordinary.",
  "content": "The important thing is knowing how to uncover it, because one cannot extract Mercury from just any substance, and it may be that the first rock we come across does not possess the necessary resistance that the Constructors demand of the stone to be used for the Work. There are certain initial vices that will disqualify the profane before any sort of test. Let us supposed that these preliminary difficulties have been overcome: the artist has found the material to use for his project. Firstly he cleans it, such that no foreign bodies will cling to its surface (cleaning of metals). When this has been done, the subject is closed inside the hermetically sealed Philosophical Egg (chamber of reflection). Thus removed from all mercurial stimulation, the Fire of life diminishes, languishes, and eventually goes out (Death of the Recipient). Upon dying, the subject is split in two: all that is ethereal within it separates, leaving behind a “shapeless and empty” residue, like the Earth before it was fertilised by the breath of the Creator (Genesis I, 2).",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, obtaining Mercury requires finding the right substance that meets the required resistance, cleaning it thoroughly, and subjecting it to the Philosophical Egg to die and undergo putrefaction. From this chaos, a seed is sown, and the Son of Putrefaction is born again, leading to the formation of life. Remember, the process requires patience and attention to detail, but the rewards are worth it."
