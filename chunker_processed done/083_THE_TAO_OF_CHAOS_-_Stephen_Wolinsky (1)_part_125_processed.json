  "first_phrase": "This text explores various ancient healing systems such as Acupuncture, Ch'i Kung, and Lowen's Bioenergetics. The author explains how these systems view the physical body as containing energy meridians and how the flow of energy in these meridians can be enhanced through specific physical body positions. The last 200 tokens focus on the similarity between Lowen's stress postures and Acupuncture's bifurcation points. The author elucidates how adding energy to this bifurcation point disperses physical mass and dissolves energy blockages in the body. In the same way, Bioenergetics techniques add energy to the body's armor, dissipating blockages and revealing past trauma.",

Translated, Chi Kung means the cultivation of energy. Chi is the chinese word for energy, and Chi Kung, like Lowen's bioenergy, uses particular physical body positions to enhance the flow of energy and hence shift dis-ease. Earlier I commented that in Sanskrit depression is defined as a lack of energy.",
