  "title": "\"What are the stages of magnetic condition and how does suggestion work in the lucid somnambulic state?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the text, we delve further into the mechanics of magnetism and suggestion in relation to the lucid somnambulic state. Colonel de Rochas pioneered the study of Magnetism and discovered that there are twelve stages of magnetic condition, separated by unconsciousness. While suggestion is possible in the earlier stages, it ceases as the sleep deepens into the lucid degree. Interestingly, in the lucid state, the will or intention of the hypnotizer seems to count for more. Teste's experiences provide a fascinating insight into the possibility of magnetized patients remembering previously agreed upon information upon awakening.",
  "content": "The Suggestionists contend that the will of the hypnotiser counts for nothing in Suggestion; but in the lucid state his will or \"intention\" seems to count for a great deal, and the will or intention of the operator may be the force that operates in persuading the subject to make a magnetic promise. Teste, who thought that the art of the magnetiser consisted in \"knowing how to impress his will opportunely,\" and who does not seem to have been aware that if a lucid subject promised to remember his experiences when magnetised he would do so, relates that on one occasion he wished a lady whom he had magnetised to know certain medical facts about which he felt a delicacy in speaking to her. When awake; he explained this to her, and she told him that if he wished it very strongly she would remember what he said. He explained the matter to her with a strong desire that she should remember all about it when she awoke, and she remembered it perfectly well. He adds \"since that period, which formed an epoch in my magnetic studies, I have many times repeated the same experiment, and always with the same success.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these examples show that the will or intention of the operator plays a significant role in the power of suggestion, even in the lucid state. If you wish to make a magnetic promise or help someone remember something, you can do so by impressing your will on the subject with a strong desire. It's quite simple, but essential to have a proper understanding of this phenomenon."
