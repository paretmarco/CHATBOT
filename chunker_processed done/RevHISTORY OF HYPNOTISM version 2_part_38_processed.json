What matters is that one should recognize it. When it comes to knowing what it actually is, we are legitimately entitled to follow what Lao-Tse has to say: “Knowing not to know is the quality of the sage. Thinking that we know is a disease”. We do not actually know what this reality we call fluid, which is moreover augmented by developing one’s consciousness, precisely amounts to. Energy is natural.",
