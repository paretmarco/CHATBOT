  "first_phrase": "This last part continues the discussion of hypnosis techniques introduced earlier in the text. The author emphasizes the importance of being precise in giving suggestions to the subconscious, avoiding negations and confirming commands through ideomotoric signals or repetition. The technique discussed in this section involves non-verbal cues such as changing breathing patterns to induce hypnosis. The author reminds readers that hypnotherapy training is necessary for those seeking advanced skills and confidence in hypnosis.",
  "content": "One possible way to reformulate this suggestion in a positive way could be “You are free of any need to smoke”. Please notice that in the first induction phrase of Hypnosleep is a negation (you can hear me but you can’t wake up), but this normally works, maybe because the sentence is repeated several times; if it does not work for you, you might want to reformulate the suggestion so that the negation is avoided, like in “You can hear me, but you keep on sleeping…” This was a raw introduction to some hypnosis techniques that might be valuable for you as a first “hands on”. Lastly, only a proper hypnotherapy training, like one you can attend at the ISI-CNV can help you to become highly skilled, widen your horizons, make your suggestions more powerful and let you gain more confidence in your abilities. Hypnosleep – non verbal method This simpler technique is very similar and more efficient. It is based on non verbal reactions. Simply look at the sleeping person and change your breathing. Look not at his face, but at his breast. For better results try for a small time to pace with your breathing the sleeping person.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnosis can be a powerful tool for self-improvement, but it requires proper training and practice to become highly skilled. The non-verbal technique of hypnosleep can be a useful starting point. By changing your breathing, you can influence the subject's unconscious and guide them towards positive change. However, it's important to remember that hypnosis should only be practiced by trained professionals."
