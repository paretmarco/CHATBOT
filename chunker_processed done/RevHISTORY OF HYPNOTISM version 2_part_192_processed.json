  "title": "\"Deleuze's Method: Achieving Results Through the Power of Gaze and Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the efficacy of magnetism as a method of healing physical ailments. The author argues that magnetism used in conjunction with a gaze produces better results than when the gaze is not used. The method involves the magnetizer making passes on the affected part of the body to balance the equilibrium. The text provides some examples of successful cures using this method, notably the case of Oudin, an old soldier, who had been paralyzed from the hips to the feet. Despite previous unsuccessful treatments, his wife's use of the Deleuze method resulted in remarkable improvements in just a few days. These examples highlight the simplicity and effectiveness of magnetism as a healing method.",
  "content": "It is useless to search out the causes of these facts, it is sufficient that experience has established them, for us to conduct ourselves accordingly, when we have no reason to do otherwise. Some examples of cures done with the method of Deleuze The method of Deleuze is very simple. 1st. Oudin, an old soldier, â€¦ was paralyzed from the hips to the feet. He could walk only by the aid of crutches, and his legs trembled continually. He had most violent pains in the loins. He had been treated unsuccessfully at the Hotel-Dieu, afterwards in the fourth dispensary of the Philanthropic Society, when Deleuze directed his wife, (although she was very feeble,) to make slight frictions, almost without touching, from his hips to his feet. From the first day, the feet which were very cold and white, grew warm and red, as when sinapsisms are applied, and a few days after, the legs ceased to tremble. The pains in the reins were always very sharp, when the physicians apprised me that the disease originated in the spinal marrow.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the method of Deleuze, as evidenced by these examples, can yield positive results in relieving pain and discomfort. While the causes of these effects may not necessarily be understood, the practical application of this simple technique can bring relief to those who suffer."
