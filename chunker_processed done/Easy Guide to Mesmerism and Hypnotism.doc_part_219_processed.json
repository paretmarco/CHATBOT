  "title": "\"The Power of Hypnosis: Creating a Dreamlike State\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author has outlined a series of experiments that can be conducted with subjects who are under mesmeric influence. Moving on to the final part of the manuscript, the author suggests leading the subjects into a cemetery or necropolis, where they can reflect on their past, grieve for lost loved ones, and come to realisations about their behavior. The author notes that they have successfully convinced many subjects to give up bad habits in this state. Following this, lively dance music is played, and the subjects are observed as they forget their previous sorrows and begin to dance. Finally, the author suggests creating a sharp noise to fix the subjects in a specific position, creating an interesting and impressive tableau. The author does not recommend releasing subjects after each experiment and instead suggests catalepsis as a means of transitioning to the final stage of the performance.",
  "content": "You can continue this pleasing experiment, with its various manifestations in the different subjects, for some little time. Make your musician play some lively dance music, and in a short time the crying, sobered, and distressed ones will forget all about the graveyard and its associations, and commence with hearty energy to trip the light fantastic toe in the gay exuberance of the merry dance. As soon as you observe them all in interesting or statuesque attitudes fix them suddenly therein, by a sharp noise (such as the clapping of your hands together and the stamp of your foot on the platform would make, the music suddenly ceasing at the same time). The effect is remarkable. Your audience will follow each change suggested with interest, and greet the final tableaux with hearty, unstinted applause. Some operators release or de-mesmerise their subjects after each experiment. This is unnecessaryâ€”a waste of time and energy, without compensating effect. You may then take a subject and catalepse him, make his body, or any portion thereof, as rigid as a board. Take one of the foregoing subjects, de-mesmerise his legs and body by lateral and upward passes. Get him to stand erect in the centre of the platform.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnosis can be a powerful tool for creating fascinating and entertaining experiments. If you choose to continue this practice, be sure to follow the steps carefully and don't waste time and energy releasing or de-mesmerising your subjects after each experiment. With practice and skill, you can create remarkable effects that will captivate and entertain your audience."
