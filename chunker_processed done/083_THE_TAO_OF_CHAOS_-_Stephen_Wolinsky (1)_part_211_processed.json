  "title": "Working from Essence: A Therapeutic Approach",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the text, the therapist helps the client explore the emptiness he feels, eventually leading to a sense of peacefulness. The therapist notes the importance of starting with essence instead of personality and asks the client to inquire with the different layers of their identity. The client seeks safety and purpose to feel okay. This Tao of Chaos approach aims to reach a feeling state rather than working through personality to reach essence.",
  "content": "For that reason, we work from Essence to personality, rather than from personality to Essence. For example, most therapists feel that if you work through personality, you will reach your Essence. However, few people, even after years and years of therapy, do reach their Essence. THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 169 The Tao of Chaos asks us to work from Essence making it our starting point rather than our finishing point. In contrast, most therapists have personality as the starting point in hopes of Essence being the finishing point. Therapist: From \"back there\" in the peaceful space how do the different layers and I-dentities in the foreground seem to you? Client: They seem less significant. Therapist: Ask the first I-dentity, the one who feels powerless, \"what you are seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: To know things are okay. Therapist: Ask the I-dentity, \"If you felt okay, what would that feel like?\" Therapeutic Note We want to get to a feeling, so we always ask, what would that feel like? Client: Safe and like everything had a purpose and was perfect.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, working from Essence rather than personality, as suggested by the Tao of Chaos, can be a valuable approach in therapy. By focusing on the client's core identity and needs, therapists can help clients achieve a sense of peace, purpose, and fulfillment that goes beyond mere behavior and personality."
