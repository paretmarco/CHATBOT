  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of magnetism and its relation to gratitude. Now, we present some interesting researches that shed light on the power of healing energy. One example is the work of Bernard Grad, a researcher who found that the healing energy of Oskar Estebany could influence the growth of barley seeds and the healing of wounded mice. Moreover, other studies suggest that the mood of the healer can impact their work. In this way, we can observe how the energy of a person can affect the environment, even at the molecular level.",
  "content": "The water from each person was used to water a group of seeds. A control group of seeds received water that had not been held by anyone. \"...the seeds treated by the psychiatrically normal man grew better than did all the other groups of seeds....When the mood of the neurotically depressed woman improved she, too, showed an ability to influence the seeds.\" None of these people were known to have healing abilities. In any case, other studies indicate that a healer's positive or negative mood can affect the results of his/her work. During the relaxed summer pace of Rosary Hill College (Buffalo, New York), M. Justa Smith, PhD, a biochemist, was amazed to find that healer Oskar Estebany increased the activity of enzymes in a solution simply by holding its container. The enzymes had been purposely damaged by ultrasound irradiation. Months later when Estebany was dealing with stressful circumstances, he was unable to affect enzyme activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these studies and experiences suggest that our emotions and energy have a significant impact on our environment and those around us. Whether it is through watering plants or impacting enzyme activity, there is evidence to support the idea of energy transference. Understanding and harnessing these techniques can lead to improved well-being, both for ourselves and for those we interact with."
