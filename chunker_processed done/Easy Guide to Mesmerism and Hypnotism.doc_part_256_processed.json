  "title": "Comparing Mesmerismus with NLP and Yoga Techniques: An Overview",
  "first_phrase": "This text compares Mesmerismus with NLP and Yoga techniques. It discusses how NLP is based on sensory perception and language shaping reality, while Mesmerism concentrates on the operator and has a stronger focus on extra-sensory perception. The complementary nature of Mesmerism and Yoga training is explored, as knowledge in different elements of Yoga could enhance results working with mesmeric techniques. Finally, the author discusses the many enemies that Mesmerism has had throughout history, who often base their judgments on the possibility that some of Mesmerism's feats could be achieved through suggestion.",
  "content": "For example, many NLP trainings are held around the world, but very few are the persons to report to have had extra sensorial perceptions through these trainings. Instead, 90% of the people training in Mesmerism report strange facts. The reason is that Mesmerism concentrates on the operator, while NLP concentrates on the strategy the operator uses to get a result. It is our opinion that training in Mesmerism could be complementary to training in NLP and enhance its validity. Comparison between Yoga techniques and Mesmerism There is a rarely studied field called “Indian hypnotism,” strictly bound to Yoga. These are the techniques used by certains fakirs to create illusions in their audience. Yoga training is very complementary to Mesmeric training. In Yoga training there are different elements and branches: * Asanas * Pranayama * Prathyara * Dharana * Mantra Yoga * Raja Yoga * Etc… Knowledge in the aforesaid elements could enhance results in working with mesmeric techniques. Enemies of Mesmerism Mesmerism has had many enemies along the centuries. Most of them base their judgement on the possibility that some of the feats of Mesmerism could be also obtained through what is called - with a much undefined term - “suggestion”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, exploring and training in different techniques such as Mesmerism, Yoga, and Magnetism can offer complementary and diverse approaches to enhancing our abilities and understanding of the human mind and interaction. By opening our minds to these possibilities, we can expand our knowledge and potential in ways we never thought possible."
