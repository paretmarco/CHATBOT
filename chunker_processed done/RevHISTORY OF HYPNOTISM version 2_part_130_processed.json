  "title": "The Discovery of Puysegur's Magnetic Fluid Theory and Somnambulism",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we delve into the study of Magnetic Healing in the 18th century. Before the Marquis de Puysegur, Franz Mesmer proposed the theory of the Universal Fluid. However, Puysegur believed in the concept of Magnetic Fluid and described its flow in the human body. He used techniques like breathing and eye fixation to impart vital magnetism to patients. In this final part, we explore the Puysegurian theory of Magnetic Fluid and learn about the directions given by him to conduct the operation.",
  "content": "Changes in theory As Mesmer left the scene, the theory of the universal fluid underwent a considerable modification, inasmuch as the agent was soon believed by the Magnetiser to be a peculiar vital fluid, secreted or accumulated more or less in the brain, and of which the nerves acted as conductors. This fluid was described as being subservient to the Will of the Magnetiser, who by his act of volition could control its influence, propel it externally or internally, and direct it so as to accumulate in any part of the living body. In accordance with these views the following are the directions- which the- Marquis de Puysegur gave for conducting the operation: 'You are,' said he, 'to consider yourself as a magnet, your arms, and particularly your hands, being its poles, and when you touch a Patient by laying one of your hands on his back, and the other in direct opposition in front of him, you are to imagine that the Magnetic fluid has a tendency to circulate from- one hand to the other through the body of the Patient.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the theory of universal fluid underwent significant changes after Mesmer, and the discovery of somnambulism by M. de Puysegur opened new doors for understanding the power of magnetism. The technique of magnetic fluid circulation, the belief in a vital fluid, and the ability to control its influence continue to inspire research and experimentation in modern times."
