  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text focuses on personal magnetism exercises, which are useful in interpersonal situations like therapist practice. Before delving into these exercises, the author recommends a morning breathing exercise that clears the passage and increases power. The exercises work on three levels: perception, activity, and presence. The first exercise involves visualizing a circle around you and the person with whom you interact; the second involves visualizing a tube connecting your navel to the other person's, and the third is to be present to yourself and bring attention to one or more parts of your body. These techniques can help increase your personal magnetism and improve your interactions with others.",
