  "title": "\"The Six Degrees and Modes of Procedure in Mesmerism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter III of the book, \"The Philosophy of Mesmerism and Electrical Psychology,\" the author explores the various phenomena associated with animal magnetism or mesmerism in individuals. The chapter titled \"Modes of Procedure\" provides detailed explanations of the six classifications of degrees that describe the effects produced on the subject. Starting from the walking stage, where there are no visible effects, to the fifth degree, where the subject experiences lucid somnambulistic stage with clairvoyance and thought-transference, the author details each degree, including the methods of inducing and understanding them.",
  "content": "3rd Degree.—THE SLEEPING STAGE.—In which the mesmeric sleep, or coma, is complete. The senses refuse to perform their respective functions. The subject is, therefore, unconscious to pain. In this stage he can be catalepsed, and his mind automatically influenced, by whatever position his body may be placed by the operator. 4th Degree.—THE SOMNAMBULISTIC OR SLEEP-WALKING STAGE.—Under which the subject “wakes up', within himself. The faculties become responsive to mesmeric influence, direction, and suggestion, the sensitive becoming largely an irresponsible agent—thinking, seeing and hearing only as permitted or as directed by the mesmerist. It is in this stage that the phenomesmeric and mostly all other experiments are conducted, whether deemed mesmeric or hypnotic. The lower form of the degree is designated by the mesmeric-psychological state. 5th Degree.—THE LUCID SOMNAMBULISTIC: STAGE.—In which, in addition to the phenomena indicated in the 4th Degree, that of lucid vision, or clairvoyance (including thought-transference, introvision, and prevision), is manifested.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the different degrees of mesmeric sleep is important in conducting successful experiments. The first four degrees are common and well-known among mesmerists, while the fifth and sixth degrees involve more advanced phenomena. Utilizing these stages can provide insight into the patient's physical and mental state, allowing for informed diagnoses and suitable treatments to be prescribed."
