  "title": "Mesmer's Theory of Animal Magnetism and its Success",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about Mesmer's extraordinary success in curing diverse diseases. His cures were so remarkable that people vied with each other to attend his séances. Now, in the last part of the text, we delve deeper into Mesmer's theory of Animal Magnetism. According to him, a subtle fluid exists that can penetrate everything and cause all kinds of motions and impressions in the human body. This fluid, with its immediate action on the nerves, produces phenomena similar to those produced by the loadstone, hence the name ANIMAL MAGNETISM. By means of Animal Magnetism, Mesmer believed that he could cure not only nervous diseases but all disorders, explain the action of medicaments, and operate the crisis.",
  "content": "“The reciprocal effects are analogous to the ebb and flow. “The properties of matter, and of organization, depend upon reciprocal action. “This fluid exercises an immediate action on the nerves, with which it embodies itself, and produces in the human body phenomena similar to those produced by the loadstone, that is polarity and inclination. Hence the name ANIMAL MAGNETISM. “This fluid flows with the greatest quickness from body to body, acts at a distance, and is reflected by the mirror like light, and it is strengthened and propagated by sound. There are animated bodies which exercise an action directly opposite to Animal Magnetism. Their presence alone is capable of destroying the effects of Magnetism. This power is also a positive power. “By means of Animal Magnetism we can effect an immediate cure of the nervous diseases, and a mediate cure of all disorders; indeed, it explains the action of the medicaments, and operates the crisis.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Animal Magnetism was a controversial and inadequately studied medical phenomenon that attracted many advocates and detractors during its heyday. While some researchers found evidence of its efficacy in treating nervous disorders, the concept lacked the scientific rigor necessary to gain widespread acceptance. Despite this, it remains an intriguing chapter in the history of medical science and a testament to the creative thinking of its founder and followers."
