  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Dr. Esdaile speaks highly of Mesmerism's potential in medical treatment, elucidating its benefits in managing conditions like nervous pains, convulsions, and inflammation. He highlights its use in treating chronic inflammation, functional nervous system problems, and as a general tonic in diseases of debility. He also provides valuable insights into the restorative powers of mesmeric sleep. In the last part, Dr. Kean reports the successful use of Mesmerism on seventy-four patients in the years 1847 and '48, with sixty-four patients discharged as cured.",
  "content": "The chronic exhibition of Mesmerism, as a general tonic in diseases of debility, promises to be of great service, especially in functional derangement of the nervous system, and I am hopeful that we have at last got a direct nervous remedy, hitherto a desideratum in Medicine.\" Of the sleep he writes:- \"Mesmeric sleep simulates perfectly sound natural sleep, and is more refreshing even if it has been resorted to for soothing pain or disturbance of the system, and can be had recourse to when it would be improper or useless to administer common narcotics, over which it has the advantage of not inducing a disagreable constitutional derangement after the specific influence has ceased. The restorative power of mesmeric sleep seems to depend upon an animal infusion of nervous vigour into the body, and when induced is a remedial agent; this may account for its superiority over common sleep.\" Of the good effect of Mesmerism, when no sleep or coma is produced, Esdaile says:- \"The refreshment from sleep, often not otherwise to be procured, and the sedative influence of the trance would alone constitute Mesmerism a valuable medical agent.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism exhibits promising benefits as a direct nervous remedy, especially in functional derangement of the nervous system. Its ability to induce a sleep-like state without side effects presents a viable option for patients who cannot tolerate narcotics. Additionally, stimulating the nervous system can provide relief even when sleep or coma is not induced. Mesmerism is indeed a valuable medical agent."
