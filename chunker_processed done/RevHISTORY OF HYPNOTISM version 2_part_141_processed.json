  "title": "\"De Puysegur's Observations on Artificial Somnambulism and Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of artificial somnambulism and the observations made by De Puysegur and Cloquet. This practice involved inducing a trance-like state in patients, who were then believed to possess supernatural powers and the ability to cure diseases. In the last 200 tokens, the author provides further insight into the abilities of somnambulists, such as their ability to accurately diagnose illnesses and choose appropriate remedies. They can also feel the pain of patients they touch and trace an illness to its cause. The text sheds light on the fascinating world of somnambulism and its potential for therapeutic use.",
  "content": "He observed, or thought that he observed, that during the crisis, the patients possessed a supernatural power which entitled them to be called physicians; it was, in fact, enough for them to touch through his clothes the sick person presented to them, in order to feel the part affected, and to indicate fitting remedies. The somnambulist” … “points out the remedies by which his fellow-creatures can be cured, or relieved of their sufferings. I have met with patients of such extreme delicacy of taste, as to be able to choose their remedies with extraordinary sagacity. Hippocrates has said: \"In our dreams we can perceive those aliments which best suit our constitutions.\" A somnambulist, on touching a patient, generally feels at the instant the pain of the latter in the corresponding part of his own body. This pain is only momentary; sometimes, however, it lasts until the somnambulist awakes. A somnambulist can trace an illness from its beginning, and sometimes discover its cause at very remote periods.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the observation made by de Puysegur and his successors about the ability of a magnetized person to indicate the necessary treatment for their illness is a fascinating discovery that reveals a dormant human capacity. This innate ability has also been observed in animals like primates who have the ability to self-select plants for their own healing. It is possible that human beings possess a similar ability to find remedies that can heal them."
