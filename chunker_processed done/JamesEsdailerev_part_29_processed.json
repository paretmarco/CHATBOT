  "title": "\"The Art of Awakenings and Pitfalls of Subconscious Language\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author warns about the potential pitfalls of using subconscious mind language in hypnotherapy, particularly when giving suggestions during hypnosis. The subconscious mind interprets language very literally, like a child, and may not respond as intended if commands are not given clearly or if complex triggers are used. The author advises to be careful when using these techniques to avoid unintended consequences or misinterpretations. Additionally, the author provides guidance on how to properly awaken someone from hypnosis to ensure they are fully out of trance and avoid any potential risks.",
  "content": "I am sure you want to avoid this… Pitfalls of the subconscious mind language Giving suggestions to the subconscious mind, in particular at trance depths like Hypnosleep, presents some peculiarities, because of the literal interpretation of the spoken words. The subconscious can be somehow considered a nine-year-old child. If you ask a subject in trance: “Would you mind standing up?” the subject will respond with a “No” (because (s)he doesn’t mind) and will not stand up, because you literally did not ask for that. The right command would have been: “Please stand up”. Things could get so far that if you tell the subject “say you love me”, (s)he could respond “you love me”. You will need some experience to get acquainted to this. Be careful especially if you want to use complex triggers.",
  "last_phrase": "To avoid pitfalls when giving suggestions to the subconscious mind, it's important to be precise in your language, avoid using complex triggers or negations, and confirm important commands. Keep in mind that the subconscious mind interprets language literally, like a nine-year-old child. By following these guidelines and gaining experience, you can effectively communicate with the subconscious mind for positive changes."
