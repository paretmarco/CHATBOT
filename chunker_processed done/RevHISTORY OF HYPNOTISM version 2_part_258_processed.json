  "content": "We constantly read in the papers of last century of a death under chloroform, followed by the verdict at the inquest, dictated by the doctor, of \"died from failure of the heart's action\" -all deaths come from \"failure of the heart's action,\" or else \"from want of breath,\" but neither coroner nor jury ever seem to see the doubtless unintentional medical joke.115 The academy and magnetism116 “There is a measure of incredulity from our ignorance as well as from our knowledge” Robert Chambers I need not dwell upon the opposition of the Faculty generally as a cause of the eclipse of Hypnotism in its mesmeric form, for that is known to everyone. However mistaken and unreasonable that opposition may seem to us, we must remember that in most instances it was perfectly conscientious; for the doctors really and truly thought that their own system was right, and that the magnetizers were a set of humbugs and frauds; or else were a pack of deluded fools. But while the doctors may claim to be held blameless, on conscientious grounds, for their opposition, they cannot be acquitted of the prejudice, ignorance, stupidity, and conceit which caused them to err conscientiously.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the opposition of the medical community to the practice of hypnotism or magnetism may have been rooted in conscientious beliefs, but it was fueled by prejudice, ignorance, and fear of losing profits. However, with the accumulation of evidence, even some of the resisting doctors became inclined to adopt magnetic treatment. It is a reminder that while we may hold onto our beliefs fiercely, we must remain open to new information and be willing to evolve our understanding."
