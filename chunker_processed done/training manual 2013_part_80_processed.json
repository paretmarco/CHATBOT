  "title": "\"The Connection Between Solar Plexus, Hara, and the Second Brain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we dive into the fascinating world of the enteric nervous system, also known as the \"second brain.\" We learn that the enteric system controls most bodily functions, communicates with the central nervous system, and has an autonomous operation. By exploring its physiology, evolutionary history, and interface with the immune system, we gain a holistic view of its significance. Dr. David Wingate, a gastrointestinal science professor, explains how the gut's nervous system is too important to not have two brains. This text builds on the previous discussions of the solar plexus and hara, highlighting the role of the enteric brain in regulating physical and emotional health.",
  "content": "There are several reasons for this. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the parasympathetic (eg, via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (eg, via the prevertebral ganglia) nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that even when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function. Evolutionary data In evolutionary terms, it makes sense that the body has two brains, said Dr. David Wingate, a professor of gastrointestinal science at the University of London and a consultant at Royal London Hospital. \"The first nervous systems were in tubular animals that stuck to rocks and waited for food to pass by,\" according to Dr. Wingate. \"As life evolved, animals needed a more complex brain for finding food and sex and so developed a central nervous system. But the gut's nervous system was too important to put inside the newborn head with long connections going down to the body,\" says Wingate. Offspring need to eat and digest food at birth.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the enteric nervous system does communicate with the central nervous system through the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, it can also operate autonomously, making it an important and independent circuit within the body. Furthermore, evolutionary data suggests that nature has preserved this system as a means of ensuring newborn offspring can eat and digest food immediately after birth."
