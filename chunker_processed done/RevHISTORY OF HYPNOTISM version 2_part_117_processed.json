  "title": "\"Magnetism: A Turning Point in European History\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the history of animal magnetism and its recognition by scientific institutions in France during the 19th century. The author discusses Mesmer's contribution to this field and the impact of his treatment on society. The text includes a poem praising Mesmer's abilities and the regrets caused by his departure. In the last 200 tokens, the author reflects on the significance of the scientific institutions' acknowledgement of animal magnetism despite the conflict and hostility surrounding it. The text highlights how the truth was eventually acknowledged, even if it had to overcome criticism and rejection.",
  "content": "If we leave aside all the irritating aspects one can discern in those attacks and the replies thereto, I believe we will find greater usefulness and significance in paying intelligent attention to the fact that the issues were studied and acknowledged by the scientific institutions, first and foremost the Royal Academy of Medicine in Paris itself, as it was forced, by the sheer logic of plain facts, to pay tribute to the truth. Mesmer's absence was in fact long regretted by a large section of the upper and middle classes. Referring to the effects produced by his treatment, and the regrets caused by his departure, a highly-esteemed poet of that day expressed himself in the following terms :â€” \" Tous se felicitoient de leurs metamorphoses, La vieille Egle croyoit voir renaitre ses roses ; Le vieillard decrepit, se ranimant peu-a-peu, D'un retour de sante menacoit son neveu ; La jeune homme a vingt ans, ride\" par la mollesse, Se promettoit encore quelques jours de jeunesse. Mesmer courut ailleurs porter son art aimable ; Chaque malade au fond de son appartement Tout seul avec ses maux s'enterra tristement, Et des remedes vains implorant la puissance, II perdit le plus doux en perdant l'esperance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, despite the controversy surrounding Mesmer's treatment and the resulting backlash, the emergence of magnetism marked a significant turning point in European history. Through philosophical, practical, and scientific means, this discovery has shed light on long-held mysteries and pointed the way towards future breakthroughs."
