  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author emphasizes that all natural phenomena are based on scientific laws, and understanding them dispels superstitions.

The exercise expands thinking capabilities, leading to a realization that one is one with God and nature. The recommended position for the exercise is kneeling behind a chair with hands and body relaxed, spinal column firm. This exercise can be done for three minutes, not more than three times a day.",
  "content": "Don't fall upon the knees; do it as gracefully as you perform all previous exercises. Have the chair about three feet from you so you can take hold of the upright bars at back of chair, one in each hand. Hands as well as body are to be perfectly relaxed, and spinal column firm. After the prelude breaths, inhale fully and deeply, at the same time tightening the grasp upon the chair bars. Inhale as long as you can conveniently without the use of effort, and without causing unpleasant feelings to any part of the body. Retain the breath as long as you can with ease, still holding tightly to the chair, and as you exhale gradually release your hold upon the bars. Exercise in this position for three minutes at a time, and not more than three times a day. You may take this exercise in the evening.",

Remember to do it gracefully, holding the chair for three minutes at a time, and not more than three times a day. Take it at your own pace and enjoy the benefits it can provide."
