  "title": "\"The Prejudices and Misconceptions Damaging Magnetism and Phrenology\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author explores hindrances to the progress of Magnetism, particularly the exaggerations made by some magnetizers, causing the facts to be dismissed outright. The author points out the differences between Mesmer and the Italian wonder-worker, Cagliostro, whose performance of powerful healings are often overlooked by critics. The author also talks about the introduction of Phrenology into Magnetism in England through Elliotson and Engledue, which caused division among magnetizers due to its surprising claims and perceived atheistic nature. This prejudice against Phrenology was mainly due to how it was believed to lead to materialism and the loss of moral responsibility.",
  "content": "For truth’s sake it is necessary to state that even Cagliostro performed powerful healings, and that critics throughout the history of magnetism very rarely want to deal with what really matters (the healings) but love to dwell more on ‘why’ something happens instead on ‘what’ in fact happens. Phrenology and Magnetism A conspicuous instance that also brought attention away from truthfully examining magnetism individually, was the incorporating into Magnetism of the struggling \"science,\" Phrenology, which was effected in England chiefly under the auspices of Drs. Elliotson and Engledue. Not only did the surprising claims made for Phreno-magnetism prejudice a sector of the public against Magnetism itself, but they were a cause of division among magnetizers, many of whom looked upon Phrenology as a pseudo-science. The chief reason for the prejudice against Phrenology at that time was that it was regarded as \"atheistic,\" a belief in it being thought by many people to lead infallibly to materialism. The phrenologists contended that men always act according to their own natural dispositions, and to their heredity and their environment, and this seemed to take away moral responsibility.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while critics of Magnetism may focus on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\" of the practice, it is worth noting that even historical figures like Cagliostro were known for their powerful healings. Furthermore, the incorporation of pseudoscience like Phrenology into Magnetism caused division and prejudices, distracting from the true potential of Magnetism to heal and help individuals. Despite these obstacles, it is important to observe Magnetism through pure observation and without bias."
