  "title": "\"The Connection Between Self-Deception, Objectification, and Judgement\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author underscored the negative consequences of objectifying and dehumanizing others through self-deception, which results in losing our humanity and compassion. The solution? To sit with people and appreciate them as human beings with their unique thoughts and emotions. However, the path to self-awareness is impeded by lies, self-hatred, and overcompensation, which often lead to judgment and envy. For instance, the author shared with their client how envy could fuel criticism of others.",
  "content": "If I lie to you about who I am, I am saying at some level that I hate who I am, and I want to convince you through my lying that I am not the way I really am. The simple solution to lying to another is to ask yourself, \"By telling this lie, what am I resisting or hating about myself?\" Becoming aware of the I-dentity that hates itself for being a certain way allows us to see how we over-compensate by presenting an image that is acceptable. For example, if I see myself as selfish, and deny its existence, I judge it bad or wrong. I will then probably present an image of generosity to another as a way of defending and compensating for the self-hatred. To take apart judgement, we must first confront our lies, self-deceptions, overcompensations, and criticisms of others. Judgement = Envy Often times we find ourselves criticizing others when in fact we are envious of others. For example, recently a client of mine told me that when she was young she was highly critical of wealthy business people. Years later, as an attorney, she became exactly like the wealthy business people she was so critical and judgmental about.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome judgment and self-hatred, we must confront our lies, self-deceptions, overcompensations, and criticisms of others. By becoming aware of the \"I-dentity\" that hates itself and identifying what we resist or hate about ourselves, we can break free from the cycle of negative self-talk and envy. Letting go of judgment is a powerful step towards self-acceptance and inner peace."
