  "title": "The Three Schools of Animal Magnetism and Slanders Against It.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the division of animal magnetism into three separate schools after 1800: Mesmer's school, the Chevalier de Barbarin's school, and the Marquis de Puysegur's school. Despite their differing theories, all three schools produced the same practical results. The text also mentions a secret report submitted to the King in 1784, in which the Commissioners expressed their belief that practicing magnetism could be dangerous to public morals.",
  "content": "Notwithstanding the magnetizers divided themselves into these different sects, they all maintained the same fundamental principles: they differed in theory, but each school agreed in producing the same practical results. In fact the knowledge of the processes and of all the conditions necessary for the efficient use of magnetism, is independent of the opinions which serve to explain the phenomena.98 Slanders about magnetism The Commissioners of 1784 had sent to the King a secret and supplementary report, which said that 'the practice of Magnetism would be attended with danger to the public morals.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, despite the divisions among magnetizers, they all agreed on the fundamental principles of producing practical results. The accusations of sexual immorality and insanity were baseless and fueled by ignorance and depravity. We should not let such false claims discourage us from exploring the benefits of magnetism."
