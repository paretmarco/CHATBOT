  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the importance of breathing and how it relates to our overall health. The author emphasizes that breathing deeply and fully is crucial for lung development, and provides an exercise to help increase breathing capacity. The final note also notes the importance of wearing loose clothing to allow for easier breathing. This information can be helpful for anyone looking to improve their breathing habits and overall health.",
  "content": "Just before exhaling, bring your arms down and, throwing them behind, begin to exhale slowly. Empty your lungs as much as possible and repeat this exercise seven or more times. Once having gone through this exercise perfectly, you will gladly make it a point to follow it regularly, for the benefits derived from it will be beyond even your most sanguine expectations. Remember also that physical breathing cannot be done properly unless you allow your body to be perfectly free from all pressure. The garments must be loose, very loose, so that the chest and diaphragm can expand easily to their utmost, while the abdomen inflates of its own accord. Use no effort, no strain. Breathe out first, and then breathe in fully and regularly as you feel able to do so. Breathe when walking or sitting, when you eat or drink, when you work or play --- breathe, breathe, breathe.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporate deep breathing into your daily routine, and it will have a tremendous impact on your overall well-being. Remember to wear loose clothing and breathe naturally without any strain. By taking a few minutes to breathe every hour, you can improve blood circulation, purify your blood, and remove feelings of discomfort. With persistence, you can gradually accustom your system to deeper inhalations and reap the benefits of healthier breathing habits."
