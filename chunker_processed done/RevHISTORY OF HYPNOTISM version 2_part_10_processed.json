  "title": "\"The Power of Animal Magnetism: Uniting Minds and Healing Bodies\"",
  "first_phrase": "Animal magnetism is a discipline that creates a general movement from the operator to the patient, relieving illnesses and empowering the patient's own conservative principle. Despite the accumulated 300-year track record of success, skeptics still explain its effects with other systems such as imagination, but magnetizers aim to help others feel better. In this last 200 tokens, the writer discusses the popularity of animal magnetism and how it works on animals, and no modern psychological conception of the mind can explain it.",
  "content": "“To magnetize is to direct one's thought upon a patient with a persistent will to relieve him; there then results a general movement communicated from the magnetizer to the magnetized, in which the former is principal, and is able to accelerate or to moderate the interior movement of the latter, and consequently to strengthen the conservative principle.” A. Didier An interesting fact is that part of the popularity of magnetism is that it is able to cure some illnesses that cannot be cured easily with classical treatments. Another fact behind its popularity is that it cannot be but salutary, it has no counter indication. But strangely, despite an accumulated track of 300 years of records of successes beyond every possible doubt, this discipline has always tended to provoke strong reactions. There are people who are spontaneously enthusiastic and others who are spontaneously skeptical and want to explain it with other systems such as imagination or suggestion. Even if this were the case, it would still be very useful to learn, as it works on animals as well, and no modern psychological conception of the mind can give it an explanation. Magnetizers most of the time, have only one goal: to help other people feel better.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Animal Magnetism has been a popular discipline for over 300 years due to its ability to cure illnesses without any counter indications. Despite skeptics, its benefits have been proven beyond doubt and its practitioners have only one goal - to help people feel better. The positive intent it is based on has a profound effect, even demonstrated through quantum entanglement effects in animals. Let us acknowledge the merits of these practitioners and the wellbeing they bring about."
