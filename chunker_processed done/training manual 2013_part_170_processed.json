  "title": "\"The Power of Forgiveness and Mindful Exercise\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of staying humble and not seeking validation from others while on a path towards self-improvement. The author encourages the reader to be prepared for others to notice the changes in them that come from their efforts, and to be willing to share their methods with those who are curious. This sharing of knowledge is seen as a duty, as others will need to follow a similar path in order to achieve similar results. The author also provides guidance on the frequency and intensity of the exercises being discussed, cautioning the reader that they can be quite powerful if overdone. Additionally, the reader may notice unexpected physical effects such as a phosphorescent glow at the fingertips. It is important, however, for the reader to stay grounded and not get caught up in superstition or the paranormal.",
  "content": "For though it is for you to tell them of your experiences, it is your duty as well to point out the way to them. They must tread the same path that you have trod if they would reach the goal. A thing not worth going after is not worth having. This exercise can be taken three times a day, but do not take it oftener to begin with, nor with more than seven breaths. It is a very powerful exercise, so much so that it will make the fingers burn if you overdo it. After some time you will notice a peculiar phosphorescent glow at the fingertips when entering a darkened room. For that reason it is better to close the hands after taking this exercise so as not to scare people. They might think that you control spooks and such things. It is our object to get away from all spook business and learn to comprehend all things in their proper, natural way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is your responsibility to share your experiences and guide others towards achieving the same goal. Remember that worthwhile things are worth the effort, but be cautious not to overdo any exercise, as it may cause discomfort. Always keep in mind that natural laws govern everything, and understanding them is key in eliminating superstitions. Don't forget to practice reverence and continue expanding your thoughts for a better understanding of your being and your connection with the universe."
