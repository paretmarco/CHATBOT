  "title": "\"Victor's Clairvoyance: A Magnetic Healing Phenomenon\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, it was illustrated how magnetism relieved pain and cured illnesses. In this final part, the extent of the phenomenon is showcased through an account of a peasant's healing. The peasant, who had inflammation on his chest, was cured of his ailment through magnetism. Notably, the author also demonstrated \"clairvoyance\" by identifying the treatment he needed for his illness while in a deep sleep.",
  "content": "I made him get out of bed and magnetised him.‚Äù After a quarter of an hour to my surprise I saw this person fall into a tranquil sleep in my arms, free of pain or convulsions. I urged on the crisis, which caused him some giddiness in the head: he spoke aloud of his ordinary affairs. When I thought his ideas might affect him disagreeably, I stopped them, and began to inspire him with others of a more pleasant and lively turn. It required no great efforts on my part to accomplish this. Then I saw him quite happy, fancying that he was dancing. I cherished these ideas in him, and thereby I forced him to move himself with considerable activity on his chair, as if he were to dance to an air which, by singing mentally, I made him repeat quite loudly. By these means I made the patient sweat profusely from that day. After an hour's crisis I quieted him, and left the room.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, using a combination of magnetism and positive suggestion proved successful in overcoming the patient's illness and improving his overall state. Simple methods like these can often lead to positive results, and it's important to consider all options for improving health and wellbeing."
