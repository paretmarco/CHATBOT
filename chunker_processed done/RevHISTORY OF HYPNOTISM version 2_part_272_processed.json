  "title": "How did France and the United States contribute to the development of Magnetism and its relation to Spiritualism and Hypnotism?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the history of Magnetism and its developments, particularly in France and the US. It highlights the role of laypeople in shaping these developments, particularly in the direction of the psychological side of Animal Magnetism. The text also discusses the conflict between Magnetism and Hypnotism, and how the latter's physical approach proved more efficacious. The final 200 tokens further explore the association between Magnetism and Spiritualism, particularly Spiritualistic Magnetism founded by Cahagnet. This school of thought emerged out of clairvoyance and mixed revelations from lucid somnambulists, Swedenborg's system, and Modern Spiritualism with a touch of ceremonial magic.",
  "content": "Magnetism and Spiritualism Magnetism as a healing agent also became associated in the public mind with a certain type of Spiritualism, which advertised itself as a branch of Animal Magnetism. This school of Magnetism (so-called) or branch of Magnetism, was found chiefly in France, and came to a head in the 1840, thus overlapping modern Hypnotism, although ante-dating it in origin; and in some way was considered by some injurious to Animal Magnetism because it introduced into it matters against which strong prejudice existed. I allude here to Spiritualistic Magnetism, the best known exponent of which is Cahagnet (1809-1885). L.A.Cahagnet This was quite a different thing from the early ‘Spiritualistic’ school of Faith Healers. It grew out of clairvoyance, being founded on the revelations of lucid somnambulists; and was a mixture of those revelations, of the system of Swedenborg, and of Modern Spiritualism, with a dash of ceremonial magic118. The origin of this school is contemporary of Puysegur.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while magnetism as a healing agent was associated with animal magnetism, a school of thought developed in France that intertwined the revelations of lucid somnambulists, the system of Swedenborg, and modern spiritualism with ceremonial magic. This spiritualistic magnetism was different from the faith healers of the early Spiritualistic school and was associated with the Chevalier de Barberini and Monspey. Their focus on the preparation and state of mind of the magnetizer, and their ability to feel the ailments of those they treated, is reminiscent of modern theories of mirror neurons."
