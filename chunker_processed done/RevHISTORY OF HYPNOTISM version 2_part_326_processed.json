  "title": "\"What is the Cervical Plexus and How Can You Recharge it Through Magnetism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This last part describes a concentration exercise aimed at recharging the cervical plexus with energy. The author suggests visualizing imaginary threads spreading from the solar plexus to the cervical plexus while focusing on a red point. Once the visualization is clear, the recharging session lasts no more than 3-4 minutes. The text mentions Charles Lafontaine, author of \"L'Art de Magnetiser\" and a great magnetizer and propagandist of Magnetism, who played a significant role in keeping Animal Magnetism alive after Mesmer's death.",
  "content": "After you have repeated it a few times, you will carry it out more capably. Once that subsequent level is reached, you will perceive the point of the cervical plexus with greater intensity. Shortly thereafter you will feel a sensation of heat once more, whereupon you will have to feel that you have managed to accumulate such a strength that, should you wish, the like of a laser beam might flash out from you. The recharging session should not last more than three or four minutes. Recharging other plexuses: The same system applying to the cervical plexus shall be used. Notice should be taken of the fact that two plexuses, the carotid and cardiac ones, are susceptible of being recharged live in nature. Charles Lafontaine and the power of Concentration How Lafontaine became a magnetizer Another great magnetiser and propagandist of Magnetism was Charles Lafontaine, born in 1803, and the author of \"L'Art de Magnetiser.\" It is hard to say whether Dupotet â€“ or Lafontaine did the most to keep Animal Magnetism alive after the death or retirement of Mesmer and of his immediate pupils; but they differed not only in their sentiments in regard to Magnetism, but also in their field of operations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, incorporating Lafontaine's techniques for magnetising may take time, but with repetition, you'll become more capable. Once you've reached the subsequent level, you'll perceive the cervical plexus with greater intensity, and will have accumulated the strength to recharge other plexuses. Remember, the recharging session should last only three or four minutes, and similar systems should be applied to the carotid and cardiac plexuses. With determination, you too can harness the power of Concentration, just like Charles Lafontaine."
