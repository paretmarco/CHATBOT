  "title": "\"The Life and Works of Mesmer: Scientist, Controversy, and Legacy\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text tells the story of a German scientist who gained immense power and recognition in France but faced envy and hatred from the erudite society due to his resistance to the prevalent general opinion. He announced his intention to return to Germany, which worried the aristocracy, and declined a generous offer from Louis XVI to stay. He retired to Spa’s thermal baths but was soon summoned back by the Harmony Society, a group of noblemen, scientists, and jurists who wanted to learn and disseminate his doctrine. In the last 200 tokens, we see how the society grew and evolved under his guidance, despite facing obstacles and criticisms.",
  "content": "Louis XVI, under pressure to persuade him to stay, which was brought to bear by the high echelons of the kingdom, offered him a stable allowance of sixty thousand “livres” together with a splendid dwelling, which jointly amounted to a capital in excess of one million “livres”. This austere man declined such offer, stating that he wanted no favour, but only the scientific examination of his discovery. Having retired in 1781 to Spa’s thermal baths, where he once more embraced forests and Nature, and where, in 1782, the Marquise de Fleury urged him to open up a nursing home, he was soon summoned back to his trade by the intelligent voice of some four hundred good-hearted people, the pick of noblemen, scientists and jurists, who raised funds in order to be initiated to his doctrine, and set up an association called the Harmony Society in order to disseminate the benefits derived from it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmer refused Louis XVI's offer of a lavish lifestyle and instead focused solely on the scientific examination of his discovery. With the help of his students, he established the Harmony Society and set out to create a network of free treatment centers across France, which eventually spread to other parts of the world. His theory, as outlined in \"Théorie du monde et des etres organisés,\" continued to gain popularity and the benefits of his method were disseminated far and wide."
