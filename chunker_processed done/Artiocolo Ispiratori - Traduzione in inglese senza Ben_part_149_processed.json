  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the power of ocular concentration and fascination in entering a state of void. This state enables one to empty their thoughts and rid themselves of limiting beliefs. In the last 200 tokens, the process of healing by Professor Erminio Di Pisa is discussed through a quantum lens. The healing process can be explained using a quantum metaphor. As the subject recalls their pain, the professor measures and entangles himself with the situation. Through fascination, both the professor and the subject enter a state of \"no thought\" and \"no reality\" where intention gains full meaning.",
  "content": "In an analogous manner, when fascination is resorted to, the subject enters a state of void where an automatic rebalancing might occur, and where one can rid himself of limiting thoughts. The process is as mental as it is physical, so much so that one can fascinate even while he is standing quite far from a person. A quantum view And finally a quantum view of the healing process of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa. We could use the quantum metaphor to easily describe the process. As he ask the subject to recall where he feels pain, he is doing a “measurement”; he and the subject are together observing something, and touching the point, he entangles himself with the situation. As the subject get fascinated, he and the subject go very fast through a moment of “no thought” and “no “reality”. In this moment he/she is outside ordinary reality in the implicate level. Here the intention get full meaning. The operator want to see the subject well.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the process of fascination can lead to an automatic rebalancing of limiting thoughts, both mentally and physically. The healing process of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa can be described through a quantum metaphor, where the intention of the operator becomes an act of creation that modifies reality. Ultimately, this perspective offers a unique and powerful approach to healing and self-improvement."
