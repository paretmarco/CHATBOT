  "title": "Healing Through Quantum Physics and Alternative Medicines.",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author explains that although the theories and scientific proofs behind healing are interesting, they must always give place to the facts. The author, a Hypnotherapist and a representative of a union that works to defend the rights of people practicing alternative medicines, believes that there is a need for a comprehensive book on the topic of healing. The author has a vast background in modern therapies and has trained many people in the field. They believe that the historic books only show a part of the whole and try to see the past through the lenses of the present. The author further explores the idea of \"entanglement\" between the operator and subject in healing, using the terminology of quantum physics.",
  "content": "Actually in our modern world there is a vast series of healers who continue using the techniques with success under different names (Magnetism, pranotherapy or even just as ‘healers’) and continue their traditions by forming new practitioners. The author I myself am representative of a union that works to defend the rights of people practicing alternative medicines. I am also a Hypnotherapist, and have a recognized school for forming both hypnotherapists and psychotherapists. I also have a vast background in what are called ‘modern therapies’ such as NLP, EFT, EMDR and many others. In our institute I have also assembled a library of many thousands of books, both modern and ancient, that I believe are rarely found elsewhere. Therefore, after having myself practiced as well as having trained many people, I obviously continue practicing each year and so I believe I have all the authority needed for writing such a book. I think there is a need for this, as most of the historic books speak only of a part of the whole and try to see the past through the lenses of the present.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the world of alternative medicine is vast and diverse, with a rich history and tradition of healers using different techniques such as magnetism and hypnosis to treat patients. By combining these ancient and modern therapies, practitioners can benefit from a wider range of approaches to help those in need of healing. With continued practice, study, and collaboration between different practitioners, the future of alternative medicine looks promising."
