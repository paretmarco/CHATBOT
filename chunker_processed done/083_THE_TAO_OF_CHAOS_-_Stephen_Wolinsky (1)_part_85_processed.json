  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the idea of phase space in Chaos Theory and how it applies to measuring objects in the physical universe. In this last part, we'll apply this concept to our thoughts and emotions. We'll see how a thought or emotion, such as \"I feel bad,\" occupies a phase of space, has energy, and a solidness to it. We'll dive deep into the concept of phase space and how it plays a role in our mental and emotional states.",
  "content": "(Chaos, James Gleick, p. 49-50) What phase space means for our purposes is that if we have a rocket that is travelling from earth to the moon, then the rocket occupies a particular space. In other words, as the rocket takes off from earth and goes to the moon the first ten seconds might occupy a phase of space of one hundred feet and the next ten seconds might occupy a phase or part of space that is one thousand feet. In the next ten seconds it might occupy a phase of space or a part of space that is ten thousand feet. So in order to measure a rocket, you would measure the phase of space or the part of space that it occupied at any given moment. Let's take as an example, a thought called \"I feel bad.\" That thought has a phase of space that it occupies. If you could watch the thought, it would arise, it would occupy a phase of space in different points of space, and then it would subside.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of phase space allows us to understand that all experiences, thoughts, and emotions can only exist in a specific and defined space. By recognizing this, we can begin to approach our experiences with a greater awareness and understanding of the role that space and time play in shaping our perceptions and realities. So, we must learn to be mindful of the phase space of our thoughts and feelings in order to better understand ourselves and the world around us."
