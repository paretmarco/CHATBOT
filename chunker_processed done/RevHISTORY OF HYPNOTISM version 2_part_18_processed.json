  "title": "Healing Principles: Integrating Different Disciplines Beyond Science's Explanation",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text of roughly 300 tokens, the author delves into the integration of various disciplines to address a range of problems stemming from dissociation of the body. They identify magnetism as enhancing body awareness and leading to a state of balance. However, this principle doesn't account for all cases of healing, notably those of animals. In such cases, love and operator energy play a significant role. The author asserts that theories and scientific proofs must give way to facts. The conclusion remains that healing power lies beyond the scope of standard medical frameworks. In the following 200 tokens, the author explores how quantum physics can shed more light on healing phenomena. They describe the entanglement between operator and subject and the creation of coherent states in the operator's brain as essential elements of this phenomenon.",
  "content": "This other explanation can be expressed by using the terminology of quantum physics. In quantistic terms, we can see that between operator and subject there is some sort of ‘entanglement’ which is very similar to what is described in quantum physics. The creation in the operator’s brain of ‘coherent states’ might be a fundamental element. In any case, theories and scientific proofs, though interesting, must always give place to the facts. Modern researchers (Meheust 2005) have asked: is it better to know the reason why, and not be healed, or not to know the reason why, and be healed? Science has often crossed the path of such healings. Physicians have often worked together with healers who worked with the main tenets of Animal Magnetism, but nevertheless the reason why is still now an open territory. An important scientist named Prof. Malizia in stated in 1990: it is unexplainable in normal terms through the use of standard medical frameworks. It is the same as saying that even if we don’t know completely what electricity is, we can still make it work.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while theories and scientific proofs are interesting, the fact remains that there are healers who work successfully using different techniques. It's important to note that even though the reason behind their success is still an open territory, it is possible to access a vast library of books that delve deep into various techniques. As we navigate the different options available, it's essential to remember that healing is not just about knowing the reason why but understanding what works best for each individual's unique situation."
