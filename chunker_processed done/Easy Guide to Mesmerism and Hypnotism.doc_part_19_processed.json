  "title": "\"The School of Magnetism: Harnessing Will Power for Success\"",
  "first_phrase": "The science of Mesmerism is explored in the work of J. Coates, PhD. In the previous text, it was suggested that will power is the key to achieving one's desires through this method. Now, as we continue reading, we will gain an insight into the personal experiences of Coates with famous Mesmerists of the past, including Captain Hudson, Dr. Spencer T. Hall, and Harriet J. Martineau. Additionally, we will learn about Dr. Roth's contributions to the British Homoeopathic Society, which admit the reality of Mesmerism. These contributions and admissions are significant since they could influence public opinion.",
  "content": "I ask them to take it as it is—as something more than a mere introduction to a most interesting and important subject. My personal relation to the greatest and most successful Mesmerists of the day—both in private and public life—Captain Hudson, Dr. Spencer T. Hall, Captain John James, Dr. William Hitchman; the friends and contemporaries of Drs. Elliotson, Braid, and Gregory; Harriet J. Martineau, H. G. Atkinson, F. G. S, and others—has not been without a marked —shall I say “Mesmeric”—influence on myself, contributing in no mean degree to my acquaintance with the subject experience, and well known career as a public Mesmerist. Dr. Roth, President of the British Homoeopathic-Society, admits the facts of Mesmerism, and contributes learned articles on the subject to the Society and its journal. He declares: “We cannot any longer afford to sneer at the miracles performed at the institution, known by the name of Bethshan, since we have healers in our midst who dispense with both physic and faith. These healers are medical men.” These are important contributions and admissions. They will have some influence with the public, who are always more or less influenced by the opinions of the Faculty.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to approach Mesmerism and Hypnotism with caution and responsibility, especially when conducting experiments on patients. While there are notable figures who endorse these practices, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being of patients and only engage in curative and uplifting experiments. Let us learn from the mistakes made in other countries and ensure that these practices are used for the betterment of individuals rather than for abuse or exploitation."
