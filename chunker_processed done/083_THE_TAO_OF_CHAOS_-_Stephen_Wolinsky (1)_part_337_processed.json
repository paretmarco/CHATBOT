  "title": "\"Dismantling Observer fixations through Attention Training\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final segment of \"Quantum Consciousness: Volume I,\" the focus turns towards dismantling the observer as a fixation of consciousness. This fixation is explored as a trance-like state that fixates on and becomes the experience it observes, preventing the emergence of objective consciousness. Before delving into observer trance, the characteristics of attention and observation are explored. Noted Sufi Master Idries Shah highlights how attention operates in transactions and how the desire for attention can generate motivations for transactions. Shah's insights are used to explain the various strategies used by the observer and I-identities in relating.",
  "content": "That this attention factor is operating in virtually all transactions. 2. That the apparent motivation of transactions may be other than it really is. And that it is often generated by the need or desire for attention activity (giving, receiving, exchanging). 3. The attention activity, like any other demand for food, warmth, etc. when placed under volitional control, must result in increased scope for the human being who would then not be at the mercy of random sources of attention....\" (Learning How to Learn, Idries Shah, p. 85) Here Idries Shah is saying that the observer and I-dentities have three primary strategies in relating. One, they can give attention to a person, object or event. Second, they can receive attention from a person, object or event; or third, they can exchange attention with a person, object, or event. \"Confusion is caused by the fact that the object of attention can be a person, a cult, an object, an idea, interest, etc. Because the foci of attention can be so diverse people have not yet identified the common factor - the desire for attention.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the power of attention and its influence on our behavior and relationships is crucial to our personal growth and freedom. By recognizing and dismantling habitual patterns of attention, we can break free from the constraints of our past and expand our possibilities for the future. Advanced Attention Training is a powerful tool for achieving this transformation."
