  "title": "\"The Sensorium Commune: Reconnecting with Nature through Meta-Sense\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, we delve deeper into the concept of the \"Sensorium Commune\" and its role in shaping perceptions. Mesmer believed that it was the \"sixth sense,\" capable of perceiving elements that eluded single senses. This meta-sense is essential when we cannot solve situations through rational senses. We must establish contact with this quintessence, which resides beyond single elements, to attain a state that transcends physical reality. In doing so, we can free ourselves from disturbances, reconnect with nature, and become capable of dropping old ways of acting.",
  "content": "It consists in the attainment of a state which, while being in the physical reality, nevertheless transcends it. It is this capacity to transcend the situations, be in control of oneself in the contingent circumstances, and free from fears, which represents a first essential step. This step can only be actualized if we are in a state of presence. Thereupon, instead of freeing ourselves from the senses, we might free ourselves in the senses, that is, make use of them freely. The Sensorium Commune and the reconnection with Nature This quintessence, therefore, is natural. It is man, with his mental superstructures, who has distanced himself from it. Indeed, instead of dominating activities by the senses, he allows them to perturb him and drive him away from balance. By contrast, the more we able to remain in the basic state, the more we become capable of dropping the old ways of acting.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the attainment of a transcendent state requires the ability to transcend physical reality and be in control of oneself, which can be actualized through a state of presence. By reconnecting with nature and utilizing our senses freely, we can drop old ways of acting and allow our central self in contact with our true nature to make decisions congruous with our being. Access to the Sensorium Commune and a state of harmony can be achieved through techniques such as animal magnetism, enabling the rediscovery of our primitive, animal dimension. With these steps, we can reach a state of balance and harmony with ourselves and with the world around us."
