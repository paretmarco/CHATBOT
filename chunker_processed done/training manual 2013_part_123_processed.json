  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author addressed the concept of magnetic attraction and rapport, which is similar to quantum entanglement. In this section, the author delves deeper into exercises that can increase magnetic sensitivity and the importance of being present in the NOW to fully utilize energy. The text discusses the idea that time is a construct of the mind and events simply ARE, rather than becoming. The author suggests that being in the present is crucial for practicing magnetism and fascination. The section ends by highlighting how the perception of linear time can put pressure on us.",
  "content": "MASTERING THE KEY OF TIME The power of Now For practicing magnetism as well as fascination we must be in the present, in the NOW, and this because only in the present we can feel and use energies. Each situation is a new situation and we must never resort to past experiences for doing magnetism. We cannot \"anchor\" this state of NOW. We must practice for being in the present. The ordinary man obeys to the law of becoming and to the law of time. However, the idea of time is a construct of our mind. Quantum’s physics and ancient wisdom coincide. With regard to the time, in supreme knowledge there certainly cannot be any. In this knowledge, events do not « become », rather they ARE. There is a process producing in us that sense of time as we perceive it , and its perception is linear. The fact that time flows in this linear direction constantly puts a pressure on us.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the key of time means being in the present moment, free from the constraints of past experiences and future anxieties. By understanding that time is a construct of the mind and varies among different populations, we can enhance our sensitivity to energy and practice magnetism. Remember to always be mindful of the Now and stay present to fully tap into the power of time."
