  "title": "\"The Power and Techniques of Virgilio and Rolando\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author shares his experiences with Virgilio, a medical diviner with a special sensitivity to energies. The author became Virgilio's intimate student, and learned that Virgilio's powers came from disciplined work on the self and a series of techniques learnt from his master, Rolando. The author describes Rolando as a painter and a man with a very strong gaze who possessed amazing telepathic abilities. In this last part (200 tokens), the author focuses on Virgilio's life story and how he learned his art from Rolando, using his master's techniques in his work as a healer, particularly during his time in the army.",
  "content": "Here are two anecdotes which enable the readers to understand what Power Rolando, who was also a painter, exactly as Virgilio, too, was gifted with. This is the first such anecdote: His look was so forceful that it could overpower the reactions of those people who were deemed to be insane. Because of that, doctors would seek to draw help from him so as to calm down the inmates of a nearby mental asylum. The second anecdote is the following: He was regaled with an amazing telepathic ability. Once he caused a collective hallucination among a whole group of children, who firmly believed that they had seen a priest flying. Rolando as depicted by a contemporary photo The story of Virgilioâ€™s life is similarly full of such events. Virgilio had learnt his art from Rolando, and, for some time, he even used techniques devised by Rolando in his work as healer. Especially during his compulsory stint in the army, he was frequently called upon to cure his fellow soldiers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the extraordinary abilities of Power Rolando and the influence he had on Virgilio's life and career demonstrate how one's talents and passions can lead to unique experiences and accomplishments. Learning from others and practicing required skills can open doors to new and unexpected opportunities."
