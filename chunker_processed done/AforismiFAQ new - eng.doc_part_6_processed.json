  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the relationship between self and essential being, and how accessing the essential inward being leads to mastery over the self. We learn that words can be a barrier to reality and that a non-verbal dimension is denser, leading to triumph. The concept of mirroring and magnetism is also discussed, and we end with Virgilio's Aphorisms on conquering emotions and understanding reality versus appearance. In the last 200 tokens, we delve into the symbolism of life as a movie house and playful game of mirrors, and how conquering emotions can lead to success.",

You should avoid giving voluntary answers. Rather, let your body answer unconsciously. Reality and appearance Reality is simply what one imagines. Life is a movie house, and the mirror is the symbol of it Life is a movie house and a playful game of mirrors.",
