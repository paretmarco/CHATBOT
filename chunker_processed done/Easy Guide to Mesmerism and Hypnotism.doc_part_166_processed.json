  "title": "\"Thought Reading and Psychometry: Understanding and Developing Spiritual Perception\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explains psychometry, a psychic ability that enables people, with a highly developed spiritual perception, to perceive a thing's history and associations. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses thought-reading and its relation to modern spiritualism and conjuring. They distinguish between the performances of Mr. Irving Bishop and Mr. Stuart Cumberland, which were a \"compound of trickery,\" and Mr. Edwin James, who genuinely reproduced scenes. James claims only to reproduce thoughts given a physical shape. The author explains that thought reading is still in its elementary stage, and mesmeric subjects in the waking state and young children make the best sensitives.",
  "content": "Travesties of modern spiritualism, and conjuring in any form, are ignored by this gentleman. Of course he finds the pin, blindfolded, and reproduces much of the time and patience-killing experiments of the other two gentlemen. He is much superior to them in this. He disclaims being a thought-reader, and claims only to reproduce such thoughts to which a physical shape has been given. If three or four of his audience are formed into a striking group upon the platform representing a tragic, dramatic, or domestic scene, should his medium picture the incident well upon his mind, he (Mr. James) can reproduce the scene by replacing the aforesaid individuals exactly in a similar position to that in which the committee had then previously. He accomplishes this by a twofold process, psychological impressions, and by muscle indications. His exhibition is the most genuine of the class. Thought reading is necessarily in an elementary stage just now. Mesmeric subjects in the waking state, and young children who have not been mesmerised, make the best sensitives. The editor of the Nineteenth Century formulated an ingenious theory about twenty years ago in the Spectator, to account for the phenomenon.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while some may still debate the scientific explanation behind thought-reading, Professor Barrett's dedicated research and the genuine exhibition of Mr. James prove that the phenomenon is indeed real. Whether done through psychological impressions or muscle indications, the ability to read and transfer thoughts is a remarkable feat that continues to fascinate many."
