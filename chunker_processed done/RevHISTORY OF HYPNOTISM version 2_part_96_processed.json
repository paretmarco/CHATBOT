In some instances, it is even possible to extract results from partly sceptical subjects. That is due to the fact that we operate at a level which is not directly linked to the conscious mind. We can see the bodily points where we experience the emotion as the ‘trapping point’ of energy, or even, by utilizing an alternative set of terms, as the point in which the emotion becomes absorbed into the body and lives inside it. In quantum point of view these points are gateway to a deeper level, and, the moment the problem is overcome, the subject feels an increase in energy and well-being. ** SUGGESTED ADDITION ** Due to the re-direction of energy from its dissipated channels of expression, into a total overall flow, thus restoring health. Our second brain A very important physical point in this regard consists in the epigastrium. Modern science confirms the fact that such area hosts a kind of ‘second brain’.",
