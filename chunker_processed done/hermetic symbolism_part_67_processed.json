  "title": "\"The Three Phases of Human Life and Hermetic Symbolism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the stages of human life, from growth to decline, and the development of spiritual powers as the body weakens. In this final part, the author discusses the Hermetic Initiation and the symbolism of the Philosophers’ stone, represented by the square crowned with a cross. The stone represents matter that has been refined and sublimated to uphold the manifestation of the spirit, which in turn surges towards absolute emancipation. The author provides a summary of the relationships between the three aspects of the stone and their corresponding stages of life.",
  "content": "These are not always Wise Men, because the true Initiate does not seek out the masses, or their admiration, which means nothing to him: he works in the midst of silent seclusion to prepare the Philosophers’ stone. This stone is given the symbol of the Square crowned by the Cross , a clearly indicative sign, given all that has already been said about the signs of Saturn , Antimony and the Achievement of the Great Work . The reader should see here the image of matter that has been sublimated, refined and surpassed to such an extent that there is nothing left but the strictly necessary structure required to uphold the manifestation of the spirit – which, starting from this bond that still holds the spirit to the physical plane, makes its final surge towards the kingdom of absolute emancipation. We will summarize the primary relationships between the three aspects of the Stone as follows: Rough Stone Cubic Stone Philosophers’ Stone Apprentice J Youth Learning Acquiring Arriving Birth Brahma Companion B Virility Practicing Organising Acting Living Vishnou Master M Old age Teaching Restoring Leaving Death Shiva The Hermetic Initiation Our aim here is not to provide the key to all possible interpretations in hermetic symbolism.",
