  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about Campanelli, an Italian healer who trained under Hermann Michel to help people quit smoking using magnetic and hypnotic techniques. Notable patients included Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, King Hussein of Jordan, and actress Mariangela Melato. In the last 200 tokens, we delve into the history of smoking and the origins of magnetism or mesmerism, a Western technique that uses vital energy to promote well-being. The first person to disseminate knowledge of magnetic methods, Franz Anton Mesmer, could not have tackled smoking as it did not yet exist in his time.",
  "content": "The thanksgiving telegram sent by King Hussein of Jordan Magnetism or mesmerism is a Western technique that works with the vital energy, which is called Chi by the Chinese and Prana by the Indians. The aim of magnetism is to reawaken the natural orientation to the well-being of oneâ€™s organism, so that it can intuitively realize what is harming it. Naturally, the doctor Franz Anton Mesmer, the first person to disseminate knowledge of the magnetic methods, could not have tackled the habit of smoking, as nicotine was not yet diffuse in his days. The birth of the cigarette is in fact placed by historians between 1831 and 1841. It is said to have been invented either in a locality called San Giovanni d'Acri, or by the Muslim soldiers who, in the course of the 1831-2 siege, seemingly replaced the arghile or hookah with small tube-like pieces of paper which had been emptied of gunpowder by them, or possibly by the Englishmen who had landed in 1840, again in San Giovanni d'Acri, as part of a military campaign waged against Egypt.",
