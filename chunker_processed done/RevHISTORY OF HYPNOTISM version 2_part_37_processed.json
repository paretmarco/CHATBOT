  "content": "Science’s acceptance of the concept of “vital force” has first occurred at the hands of ethnologists (R.H. Codrington - 1891) who were busy studying the Indonesian and Polynesian regions. Thereafter, it was taken up by the founders of religious ethnology (R.Marett, M.Mauss and E. Durkheim). It was in fact discovered that this force was present as an essential principle in most diverse cultures ranging from Asia and Africa to the American Indies. As stated by Mauss in this connection, “this composite idea of force and environment eschews classification in terms of the rigid and abstract categories of our language and reason. From the viewpoint of an intellectual psychology of the individual, such composite idea eludes explanation. Let us however investigate whether a psychology of the individual within a collective unit, which is not steeped in intellectualism, might concede and explain its existence” What is garnered from reading Mauss’ words is that it is important to understand that these studies might be carried out without the need to pose the question as to whether or not such ‘vital energy’ can be proved at a physical level.",
