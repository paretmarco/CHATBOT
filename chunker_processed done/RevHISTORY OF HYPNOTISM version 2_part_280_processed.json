  "title": "What is the connection between Dupotet and Lafontaine and the development of Magnetism after Mesmer?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the complexities of the practice of Magnetism, due to the difficulty of distinguishing between physical and mental cause and effect. The text also touches on the different branches of Magnetism: Magnetism, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, Suggestionism, and Psychometry. The last 200 tokens focused on two significant figures in the field: Baron Dupotet de Sannevoy and Mons. Lafontaine. Both men are considered to have done extensive and valuable work in Magnetism after the death of Mesmer. The author discusses the contributions and personalities of Dupotet and Lafontaine and notes that some believe that the field of Magnetism might have been forgotten had it not been for their efforts.",
  "content": "– Dupotet: How he became a magnetizer – His school of Magnetism in Paris – He visits England – His theory – His \"Magic Telegraph\" Experiments in \"suggestion\" – The \"spiritualist\" Magnetism of Cahagnet – The \"magic mirror\" - Dupotet`s method of magnetising. Lafontaine: How he became a magnetizer – His belief in the ‘fluid’ – He magnetises the lions in the Zoo – A strange experience – His interview with Pius IX. – His personality The new or Puysegurean school of magnetism is intimately connected with the names of Baron Dupotet de Sannevoy, and Mons. Lafontaine of Geneva, who, of all ‘the great magnetisers,’ undoubtedly did the most extensive and valuable missionary work during the forty years that followed the death of Mesmer. No one else had the courage, enthusiasm, or ability to do what they did. It is sometimes said that “but for Dupotet magnetism would have been forgotten after Mesmer, as it was after Van Belmont”; that is equally true of Lafontaine, and before I pass on to the consideration of Braid's work, I must say something about these two missionaries.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the pioneering works of Dupotet and Lafontaine in the field of Magnetism have left an invaluable contribution to the history of this practice. Their extensive missionary work and dedication to advancing the theory and techniques of Magnetism have ensured its survival and development. Through their unique methods and experiences, they have shown that anyone can tap into their magnetic power by simply connecting with nature and the energy within them."
