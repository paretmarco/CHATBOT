  "title": "\"Campanelli's Revolutionary Method to Quit Smoking\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the life and work of Advocate Campanelli, who emancipated over 1,000 doctors, including high-profile figures such as King Hussein of Jordan and Shimon Peres, from the habit of smoking through his unique method. The method involved touching the smoker's neck, sternum, arms, and hands for a few seconds without explanation. Professor Enrico Malizia, a renowned toxicologist, conducted research on Campanelli and concluded that his results were exceptional. The success of his treatment extended to famous movie directors, politicians, military leaders, and more. In this last part of the text, we learn how Federico Fellini, the iconic Italian filmmaker, expressed his admiration for Campanelli's work.",
  "content": "Federico Fellini’s greetings The advocate “healed” through the medium of an incredible system. Campanelli would meet with the smoker, whereupon he would touch him with his hands on the neck, sternum, arms and hands: It was a ritual which lasted but a handful of seconds, usually fifty. The said method was carried out without tendering any explanation or uttering any word. Professor Enrico Malizia, a Scientist and Toxicologist of worldwide renown, studied Campanelli in 1986, when he held the post of Director of the Anti-poison Centre at Rome’s “La Sapienza” University. In the report he drew up after the conclusion of his research, he said among other things the following: “It is indisputable that Campanelli manages to “cure” the habit of smoking successfully … I am an orthodox doctor, and as such I do not accept methods and practices which are not scientific in a traditional sense. In spite of that, I have to admit that the results achieved by Advocate Campanelli are exceptional.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, even renowned scientists and specialists have admitted the exceptional results achieved by Advocate Vincenzo Campanelli's unconventional method of \"curing\" smoking. While the method's effectiveness still eludes traditional scientific evaluation criteria, a simplified version of the method can be used to achieve greater self-awareness or help a friend."
