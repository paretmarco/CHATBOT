  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we read about the use of different poles in magnetism, such as the mental pole, the eye pole, and the hands pole. These poles, when used in combination, can create equators that contribute to improving the body's health. Now, let's discuss the tools that a magnetizer uses, such as the sound of the voice, the fire of the eyes, and magnetized water. Additionally, we will also learn about how to touch a patient in a way that they can feel the magnetic effects. Lastly, we will explore how to determine the seat of the pain and the cause of the patient's illness.",
  "content": "We must put ourselves in face of this patient, with our back toward the Northern side, and put our feet against his feet; after we must put without pressing, the two thumbs on the nerve of the solar plexus, and the fingers on the \"hypocondres\". It is good from time to time to move our fingers on the sides, and mostly toward the (rate) and to change place to the thumbs. After 15 minutes in this way, we work in another way and this on the basis of their health state. It is always good to have a hand from one side and the other from the other side. If we have a general illness we go with our hands from the top of the head and along the shoulders until the feet. === At the begin you must put the hands on tyhe shoulders, and aftrer bring them along the arms until the points of the fingers. After having done it 2 or three times you can bring energy until the feet. At this point we look for the seat of the pain and of the cause. The sick says the seat of the origin, sometimes the cause.",
