  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the use of light in schools to increase concentration and psychic gifts while avoiding eye damage. The authors refer to the research of Dr. Lefebvre and others who studied the therapeutic attributes of different colors or rays of light. In the last 200 tokens, the physics of light is explained, including its superposition of colors and the existence of thermic rays. This information helps us understand why light has such a striking effect on the mind, as demonstrated by clinical and spectroscopic observations.",
  "content": "Technically, the arrangement of the component rays of white light is known as the solar spectrum. It has been shown that the spectrum of the arc-light is practically identical with that of the sun, the difference in the light being one of intensity and not of kind. The physical and therapeutic attributes of the solar and arc-light can reasonably be supposed to be the same. Clinical and spectroscopic observations have confirmed the correctness of such supposition. The seven different colours or rays of light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These rays are known as the visible rays in contradistinction to numerous forms of invisible light-energy situated beyond either end of the spectrum (infra-red and ultra-violet rays). Some of the rays, notably those emanating from the red and more especially from the infra-red fields of the spectrum, produce heat and are, therefore, known as thermic rays. Light has a striking effect on the mind Quantum Physics Light is a superposition of different colours. A white photon does not exist.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the solar spectrum and arc-light, consisting of seven different colors and thermic rays, have similar physical and therapeutic properties. Additionally, quantum physics has revealed that light, a superposition of different colors, has a striking effect on the mind and consciousness. Understanding the nature of light and its impact on human health and cognition could have practical applications in various fields."
