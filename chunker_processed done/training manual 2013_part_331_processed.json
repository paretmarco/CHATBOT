  "title": "\"The Power of Persistent Attention for Elevated Consciousness\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed various methods of elevating one's consciousness, but emphasizes that sustained attention and vigilance can also lead to the ultimate result. In the last 200 tokens, the author uses the symbol of \"the wheel's fire\" to describe how uninterrupted attention can melt away the ego and reveal true reality. By focusing on the present moment, one can recover the primal dimension and exit time, as children do. The author quotes the philosopher Origen, who values the moment of his own transit over the purpose of life.",
  "content": "It is also in this light that one might read the evangelical sentence “blessed are the children, since theirs will be the Kingdom of the Heavens”. Indeed, the child who has yet to create his own reality and his own ego lives time differently from an adult, and is situated “outside time”. In an analogous way, we might recover such primal dimension and “exit time” through the medium of persistent attention to the now. Alternatively, if you prefer, you might quote the Alexandrine philosopher Origen: “What matters to us is not to ascertain the purpose of life, but rather the value of life. If my life is nothing more than the fleeting glow of a firefly, or the explosion of an aerolite in the darkness of a summer night, I would not care whether night is eternal. I would only be concerned with the moment of my own transit.",
  "last_phrase": "As you expand your ability to perceive the world through your right hemisphere and language of intuition, you can exit time and recover a primal dimension. Remember the importance of being present and experiencing the now, as well as finding personal meaning in your own actions. By doing so, you can increase your magnetism and improve your hypnotic skills."
