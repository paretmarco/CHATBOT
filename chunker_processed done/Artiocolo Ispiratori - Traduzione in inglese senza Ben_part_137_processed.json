  "title": "Simple Method Heals 97% of Patients with Lasting Results",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author describes a technique of healing that has yielded remarkable results. He talks about a practitioner who demonstrated this technique in front of 300 people in Milan and achieved lasting results in 97% of the people he treated. The technique involves guiding the patient beyond their rigid positions and mental habits and entering direct contact with their unconscious. The final 200 tokens of the text explain the methodology behind this technique in detail.",
  "content": "After we have caused the patient to indicate to you where he is experiencing pain, we fix him intensely so as to fascinate him, for the explicit purpose of taking him “beyond the point”, that is, beyond rigid positions and mental habits which represent the sum-total of his personal problems. At some stage, one feels intuitively that the patient’s pain has vanished. He is then woken up by a simple rapid knock of the hand over his shoulder. The most positive aspect of it all is that the person is feeling better! That seems impossible to the person who is merely watching. From a technical point of view, it is, on the contrary, very natural. The pains and the other problems we have referred to represent “fixed realities”. The moment we look at the subject, we settle his attention upon some other space. We would say that we are now in direct contact with the unconscious, if we wished to borrow Erickson’s terminology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this technique of taking the patient \"beyond the point\" has shown promising results in relieving fixed pains and personal problems. It involves settling the patient's attention upon some other space, which allows direct contact with the unconscious and ultimately guides them to a new life dimension. With further studies being conducted by Nice-based school, this technique may become a more widely accepted form of healing."
