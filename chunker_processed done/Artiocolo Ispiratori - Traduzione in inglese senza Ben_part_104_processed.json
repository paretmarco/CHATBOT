  "title": "\"The Fascinating Power of Hypnosis: The Experiments of Donato\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the power of hypnosis and its effects on the human body and mind. The writer explains how the subject loses the ability to control certain bodily movements and experiences deep disturbances in their intellectual functions. They also describe Donato's unique ability to induce wonderment and produce imaginary feelings in his subjects. The last 200 tokens emphasize the importance of effort in producing results through hypnosis and quote Cavailhon's description of Donato's eyes as predator-like in their charm. The writer leaves us with a warning about the ease with which hypnosis can work and its potential dangers.",
  "content": "He conjures up unthinkable hallucinations, engenders deceitful sensations, and makes one experience imaginary feelings: He causes a person to see and touch non-existing objects, transforms a voiceless individual into a melodious tenor, or a taciturn one into a chatter-box. He scoffs at the austere persons, moves the jovial fellows to tears, sends shivers through those who are feeling hot, and forces perspiration on a numb man. Under his influence, frivolous talks are engaged in by normally serious persons ...”. Dear friends, we have seen from this example how easily fascination works, and how relatively simple it is to produce it in nervous subjects. Cavailhon used to say the following of Donato: “Donato’s power descends from the charm oozed by his eyes, which sparkle and flash the way the eyes of a predatory beast do at night”. I would only like to add the following to Cavailhon’s words: “As in any other scientific field, no result can be achieved by hypnosis without making an effort”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the power of fascination and hypnosis can be easily produced in nervous subjects, it requires a great deal of effort and experimentation to achieve results. Donato's experiments may have stirred up doubt and controversy, but they also highlight the need for careful study and practice in any scientific field."
