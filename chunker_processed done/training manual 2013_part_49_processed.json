  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we delved into Emotional Release Method 2, a process that helps individuals gradually release emotional issues and expand their consciousness. In this section, we explore the key role of muscular tension in boosting mind power during magnetism sessions. By creating a specific rhythm through increased tension, we can stimulate coherence in our neuron activity, leading to enhanced cognition. This section also emphasizes the importance of conscious attention and gradual changes to allow for a quantum shift in one's state of being.",
  "content": "speaking for a movement saying it’s ok In such a process, if carried out well, it is possible to gradually lead to the energy being allowed to flow out beyond the usual circumscribed schemes, as well as to a progressive expansion of consciousness. A conscious attention not interfering with the process, in fact, breaks the link between bodily tensions and thought processes, and leads to a process of transformation. 4. The Key of muscular tension Every physical movement begins as an electric impulse in our brains, i.e., neurons firing in the sensorymotor cortex. As we do fascination or magnetism there are moments where we must activate our body to an higher level. Muscular tensions can increase our mind power. If we increase the tension until we begin to vibrate we will also create a specific rhythm (one sixth of second) that will stimulate some quantum reactions in our mind that we could call of “coherence”. It is as a large numbers of neurons beginning to work together in synergy.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, by consciously allowing the energy to flow and breaking the link between bodily tensions and thought processes, we can achieve a process of transformation and expand our consciousness. Muscular tensions play a key role in increasing our mind power, and by using them in fascination, we can achieve more strength. Try the simple exercise of stiffening and relaxing your arms to experience how muscular tensions can enhance your mental clarity and depth of imaging."
