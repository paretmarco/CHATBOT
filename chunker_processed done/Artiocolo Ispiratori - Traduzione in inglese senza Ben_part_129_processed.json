  "content": "He was, above all, always prepared to fascinate and hypnotize. He would attract his client through his smile and amiable personality. If we talk of vibrations, well, he was a man sending out strong vibrations. He was quite a charismatic person. Everything he said was imbued with the tone of certainty. He loved to wear very flashy ties, as he knew they would create at once a focus of attention for whoever he happened to meet. At the same time, Prof. Erminio Di Pisa was also fond of joking and fascinating while in informal contexts. Sometimes, when he was at the restaurant, he caused people he had seen for the first time to quit smoking within a few seconds. He would ask any such person if he wanted to give up smoking, whereupon he would implement his methodology. He used to deal with physical pain in the same fashion. If someone was feeling pain somewhere, he would remove it from him. He used to create a state of fascination we have subjected to a specific study.",
