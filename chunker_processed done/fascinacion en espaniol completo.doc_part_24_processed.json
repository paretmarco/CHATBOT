  "first_phrase": "In this text, the phenomenon of fascination is discussed - how certain individuals have the power to captivate and influence others, even to the point of paralysis. This phenomenon has been reported throughout history by various scholars, such as Olao Magno and Pietro Garsi, and is often connected to tales of magic and sorcery. The last 200 tokens mention how the ancients compared this phenomenon to a substance or fluid that emanates from the body of the mesmerizer, and how it can be easily linked to the power of fascination. The people and concepts mentioned in this text include the legends of the so-called Cimber, as well as numerous researchers and scholars from the Middle Ages and beyond, who have reported episodes of extraordinary healing and influence linked to the power of fascination.",
  "content": "Algunos de ellos también admitió la fascinación desde la distancia, otros lo negaron por completo, como Marcello Donato que vivió en el siglo quinientos. [22] El fenómeno “estaba fascinado” por los antiguos se lo comparaba con una sustancia, un fluido que emana del cuerpo de la hechicera, y que iba a caer en el encanto individual. Este líquido se compara a veces a vapor.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the phenomenon of fascination with the ancients was compared to a substance that emanates from the body of a sorceress and falls upon the individual. This liquid is sometimes compared to vapor, and to fascinate, one must activate the central fire of consciousness and excite the body to emit the element of air in the form of vapor. Understanding the theory of the four elements and the connection between body and soul is crucial in comprehending the power of fascination."
