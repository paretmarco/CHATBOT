  "title": "\"Understanding and Harnessing Ga-Llama: The Foundation of Your Existence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, Dr. Hanish explains the importance of systematic and concentrated breathing. He highlights that breathing not only purifies and circulates blood but also takes in Ga-Llama, the centralizing life principle. In this last 200 tokens, the author further describes Ga-Llama, which has been acknowledged as a life principle by ancient cultures. Ga-Llama is not the same as the Logos or modern philosopher's spirit. It is the foundation of our existence and fills all \"Zarvan Akarana\". Though we may lose it if we don't understand it, we can attract it and become harmonious with the universe. Every breath we take brings in new life, and every expiration returns that force to the universe as a tribute of thanks to the Eternal One.",
  "content": "Ga-Llama is not the Logos of the Greek, or the spirit of the modern philosopher. This Ga-Llama is the very foundation of your existence, and fills all Zarvan Akarana. You breathe it, yet in your inability to understand and comprehend its presence, you may not always keep it, but lose it, because of the rapidity with which it is partaken, and when lacking the power of attraction. As soon as you become conscious of it and feel the desire to draw it unto you, you become filled with it, and through its accumulating presence get into harmony with the universe which unfolds your individuality to infinity. With every indrawn breath you take on new life. With every expiration you return that force to the universe, that you may pay a tribute of thanks to the Eternal One.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of Ga-Llama is not just a philosophical idea but is the very foundation of our being. By becoming conscious of it and learning to draw it in, we can attain harmony with the universe and unleash the full potential of our individuality. The practice of inhaling for seven seconds and exhaling for an equal period can help us establish our Individual Breath and free ourselves from the limited Mother Breath, ultimately leading to a fuller and more purposeful existence."
