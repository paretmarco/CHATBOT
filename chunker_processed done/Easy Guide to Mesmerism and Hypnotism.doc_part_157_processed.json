  "title": "\"Exploring the Mesmeric State: Conversations with Sensitives\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explained the process of putting a patient into a state of mesmerized sleep, leading to a clairvoyant stage. The author emphasized that the patient in this state is not just a subject but a sensitive person with an individuality that was not apparent before. The author states that in this state, the patient can converse as a self-possessed, far-seeing being, sharing insights on various aspects of life, including self-improvement, the power of the human soul, and the destiny of the race. In the last 200 tokens, the author clarifies the importance of the clairvoyant stage and the potential benefits of exploring the deeper dimension of a sensitive person.",
  "content": "Having gained confidence, and satisfied yourself of your ability to proceed, you will learn two or three things—one, perhaps, the most surprising of all, viz, that he or she is not your subject in the sense in which the term is used—a sensitive, rather—who has a distinct and exalted individuality, of which you and he were not conscious before, lit this state he will converse with you as a self-possessed, clear-headed, and far-seeing being, from whom you may learn something about yourself, your life conditions, how to improve them, about the powers of the human soul or spirit, and the destiny and well-being of the race here and hereafter. Whether you are prepared to accept this or not will greatly depend upon your individual experience in such matters.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the steps outlined and approaching the subject with sensitivity, you may discover surprising insights about yourself and the human spirit. With patience and careful questioning, you can work with your subject to improve their lucidity and understanding, while gaining valuable knowledge about the potential of the mind and the destiny of the human race."
