  "title": "\"The Art of Mesmerism: Mastering Control and Commanding Your Audience\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last section of the text discusses the importance of a mesmerist having perfect control over themselves and their audience, while being able to entertain and minimize failures. It also highlights the dangers of fraudulent confederates in the audience and the need for the mesmerist to be clever in exposing them. The author shares a personal memory of a successful demonstration in Edinburgh with a large, but potentially hostile audience.",
  "content": "The majority of audiences being composed of persons who come more for fun and amusement than instruction they are ready in consequence to enter into the spirit of the thing, which, if successful, may amuse, the audience but it means ruin to the entertainer. He must detect the fraud, and be ready to seize a good moment to expose the humbug, and completely turn the ridicule upon him. By a clever movement the mesmerist will gratify his audience, secure their confidence, and continue to amuse them, and what is very important, with profitable results. I remember in the city of Edinburgh a brilliant audience of nearly 2000 persons, in Newsome's Circus, Nicholson Street, was assembled to witness one of my mesmeric demonstrations. There was, however, a turbulent element present. Mesmerism, or Hypnotism, not being so fashionable then as now, a good number of medical men were present, as well as some three hundred and fifty of four hundred students. Some fun was anticipated by them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while mesmerism or hypnotism can be a profitable profession, it can also be ruined by fraudulent elements when performed in front of an audience seeking amusement. To successfully entertain the audience and secure their trust, the performer must be able to identify and expose any fraudulent acts while still providing an entertaining experience for the audience."
