  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the concept of parallel universes and their structures is explored. The commentary by E David Peat explains how different universes could exist alongside our own, with no physical means of communicating between them. J.G. Bennett, a Sufi teacher, encourages us to see the depth of objects, which reveals the space they exist in and the connection between everything. The text also includes an exercise that prompts readers to see emptiness and overcome negative feelings.",
  "content": "14.) Here Bennett is telling us to focus on the depth of an object. What occurs when we attempt this experiment is that the space which objects are in becomes foreground, and the objects background. Bennett says it this way: \"There is one thing that you do get a glimpse of with this experiment, and that is seeing emptiness. You begin to be aware that what feels to be empty is not empty because it is how everything is connected.\" To illustrate this experientially: 50 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS Tao of Chaos Exercise #3 Step I Close your eyes and see the emptiness in front of your eyes. Step II As a thought goes by see it as a bubble. * Step III Next as you open your eyes and see your furniture in your house, the \"I don't get it\" world may seem not real, but check to see if you still might carry the energy of the \"I don't get it\" planet in your chest, jaw, arms, or as a feeling of despair. *For example, let's say a thought goes by that says, \"I don't understand.\"",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing Bennett's experiment, we can gain a glimpse of emptiness and see how everything is interconnected. The Tao of Chaos exercise #3 can help us see the world from a new perspective, where objects become background and space becomes foreground. By letting go of our beliefs and feelings, we can connect with the emptiness and feel the interconnectivity of all things."
