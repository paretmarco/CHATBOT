  "title": "The Power of Hypnosis and Vital Energy: Insights from Dr. J. Coates",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, the text explores the misleading terms and concepts related to hypnotism and animal magnetism. The author explains that the hypnotic state can also be induced through fascination, and that the vital fluid or animal magnetism is not a physical fluid but a more subtle level of connection between man and nature. The importance of the operator in this process is highlighted, as they are a source of change. The author also suggests that some scientific hypnotists may have unknowingly restored the power of animal magnetism. The text references notable figures such as Abbe Faria and Coates.",
  "content": "It is something to understand in its real sense. Today man is very detached from nature and animality. In the past this was different. Animal Magnetism is something that even animals possesses in various degrees, and is diffused in the nature. We connect to the others not only through words, but also at a more subtle level, referred to as “energetic.” When we are in harmony with nature and with life we are at this energetic level. We impact on this level through our will power, our emotions, etc… Therefore, the operator is very important in this process, as he is a source of change. Even if it’s called a “fluid”, this is not a fluid in the real sense of term. The word “fluid” helps us understand and helps the mind to work with it: in other words if you open the mind to the possibility of a vital fluid, and of a connection between man and nature, you can experience it and be able to act with it on other people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of animal magnetism and its connection to nature and the energetic level can greatly impact our interactions with others. By cultivating our willpower and opening our minds to the possibility of a vital fluid and connection with nature, we can use energy to influence others positively. Dr. J. Coates' work provides valuable insights into this fascinating subject. Let's explore and practice these concepts together."
