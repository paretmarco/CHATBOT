  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about the reality of natural clairvoyance and the powers of mesmeric subjects. However, the public began to associate clairvoyance with charlatanism, as Magnetism was soon invaded by quacks and pseudo-clairvoyants. This last 200 tokens focus on notable clairvoyants such as Alexis Didier and Alphonse Didier, who were capable of astounding results and powerful cures. Additionally, the text highlights the importance of distinguishing between different cases, including the power of healing and the power of finding healing remedies.",
  "content": "The patient, he says, had previously been treated \"by one of those somnambulists who live privately on the credulity of fools, or of hopeless invalids, and who sometimes make us blush at being magnetizers;\" \"a more strange, complicated, and barbarous treatment could not be devised,\" he thinks; and no wonder, for that treatment consisted of \"live pigeons with their throats cut\" applied to the feet; plasters all over the body, and \"drugs, tisans, mixtures such as no apothecary ever made up.\" This reads much more like the orthodox treatment of that day than like Animal Magnetism; but it was by such outrages on common sense that Magnetism was often judged without really enquiring about its real power. In spite of all, there were many serious clairvoyants. Among them were Alexis Didier and Alphonse Didier. Recently in France a book has been published on the former, who was capable of astounding results and powerful cures111. The power of healing and the power of finding healing remedies We must in any case make a distinction between different cases.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, while some may have judged Animal Magnetism without fully understanding its power, there were serious clairvoyants who were capable of achieving astounding results and powerful cures. The power of healing and finding remedies is not limited to humans, as even modern science has discovered that many animals have this capability. Therefore, it is important to listen to the intuition and guidance provided by clairvoyant patients when it comes to their treatment, as it may lead to better outcomes."
