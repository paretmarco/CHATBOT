  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we saw how the theory of Mesmer's universal fluid was modified to include a peculiar vital fluid that could be controlled by the magnetizer. In this last part, we'll explore the fascinating discovery made by Marquis de Puysegur in May 1784, when he observed a new phenomenon while magnetizing a young peasant named Victor. During his sleep, Victor displayed remarkable intelligence and could communicate telepathically, inspiring cheerful sentiments. This discovery led to the development of a new theory of somnambulism.",
  "content": "You can vary the position, but always act where the greatest number of nerves converge.” Puysegur’s discovery of somnambulism In May 1784, M. de Puysegur71, living in retirement on his estate of Buzancy, near Soissons, magnetized and healed several persons successfully in the preceding way, but then on one occasion he chanced to observe the production of an entirely new72 phenomenon!73 A young peasant named Victor, twenty-three years of age, who had been suffering for four days from inflammation of the lungs, was thrown by magnetism into a peaceful sleep, unaccompanied by convulsions or suffering. He spoke aloud, and was busied about his private affairs. It was easy to change the direction of his thoughts, to inspire him with cheerful sentiments. He then became happy, and imagined that he was firing at a mark or dancing at a village fete. In his waking state he was simple and foolish, but during the crisis his intelligence was remarkable; there was no need of speaking to him. Some sort of telepathic communication was at work since he could understand and reply to the thoughts of those present.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism was a revolutionary breakthrough that allowed for the healing of physical ailments through telepathic communication and clairvoyance. As the position of magnetism could be varied, this practice could potentially provide a practical and alternative solution for those seeking medical treatment."
