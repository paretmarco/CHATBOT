  "title": "\"The Concept of Presence: A Traditional Approach for Daily Life\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we saw how the tradition of presence has remained unchanged and unchangeable over the centuries through various organizations like the Rosicrucians. In the last 200 tokens, we'll dive deeper into the Egyptian tradition and its therapeutic dimension. Cagliostro, a renowned member of the Egyptian Rite, spread his variant of the Rite in Paris and healed many sick people whom official science had failed to cure. Another important figure in the Egyptian Rite was Count of Saint Germain. The tradition still endures and can be traced back to a colony founded by Egyptians in Naples, where there is still a place today called \"Nile's Little Square\" that once housed headquarters for one of the Rite's main branches.",
  "content": "The Western variant of the Egyptian tradition endured even after the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, specifically in Naples, where several Egyptians had relocated, and where they had founded their own colony. Until the present day, there is in Naples a place called “Nile’s Little Square”. It hosted the headquarters of one of the main branches of the so-called “Egyptian Rite”. The said Rite, apart from pursuing alchemical practices targeting man’s improvement, encompassed also a therapeutic dimension which found expression on more than one historical occasion. The list of those who developed the therapeutic side of the Egyptian Rite included the renowned Cagliostro, who transformed its contours, spreading one specific variant thereof which he had personally elaborated in Paris. From 1776, he healed many sick people in respect of whom official science had acknowledged its incapacitation to find a cure. Another member of the Egyptian Rite was the famous Count of Saint Germain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Western variant of the Egyptian tradition had a lasting impact in Naples through the establishment of the \"Egyptian Rite,\" which encompassed both alchemical practices and a therapeutic dimension. Notable members of this group include Cagliostro, the Count of Saint Germain, and Giuliano Kremmerz who were committed to promoting healing and well-being. Furthermore, the ideas of the Rite may have even influenced Mesmer, highlighting the importance of staying present to avoid being trapped in a virtual world created by our thoughts."
