  "title": "Comparing Magnetic and Quantum Theories of Reality.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the parallels between traditional Chinese medicine, modern quantum theories, and Mesmerismus. It also sheds light on the concept of magnetism and its roots in what used to be called “magic”. The author highlights how Mesmerism and traditional Chinese medicine both refer to energy flows, while magnetism shares similarities with modern quantum theories in the way we perceive reality. The last 200 tokens delve into the idea that reality is something we create based on our senses and that the magnetic fluid is difficult to measure from a \"pure rationalistic point of view\".",
  "content": "If we change the “we,” we change the world. The magnetic fluid is something that from a “pure rationalistic point of view” is very difficult to measure, and therefore some people believe it doesn’t exist. But the “pure rationalistic point of view” itself is a point of view which tries to see reality in a certain way, as done from distinct parts and measurable with mechanic devices. Modern Quantum theories open our mind in a different direction. As we know, one of the starting points of modern quantum analysis is the experimental fact that light (the photon) can be at the same time both a particle and a wave. This duality can be explained in various ways. One of these ways is observing that we want to see reality as made of particles. But reality could be very different. The idea of “Particle” exists in the human mind, which sees reality in a way compatible with its everyday reality, but it doesn’t mean that “outside ourselves” there is really something we could call “particle”. We are bound to our senses, and we create an idea of reality based on them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the way we perceive reality is limited by our senses and the human mind's understanding of it. Just because we cannot measure certain phenomena like the magnetic fluid does not mean it does not exist. Changing the way we view the world and our place in it can have a significant impact on our understanding and ultimately shape the world into a better place."
