  "first_phrase": "In this fascinating conclusion, we delve further into the history of magnetism and the exploration of the world of the unknown. The Marquis of Puysegur's discovery that magnetizing his valet could induce lucid sleep and telepathy led to the exaltation of intellectual abilities and clairvoyance. As explained by Deleuze, this form of magnetism has a therapeutic side, with some somnambulists gifted enough to provide diagnoses and treatments for illnesses. An intriguing insight into the unexplored potential of magnetism.",
  "content": "As one magnetist put it: “The soul lands like an eagle on top of the clouds, at the time when the external senses are asleep. As it then towers over all the actions engaged in by matter, it can simultaneously embrace the entire gamut of physical possibilities”. Deleuze Such a form of magnetism, too, discloses a therapeutic side. To say it in the words of Deleuze 15: “«No doubt there are somnambulists who are gifted such a degree of lucidity that, when they are confronted with a sick person, provide a clear explanation of the origin and cause of his illness, and accordingly prescribe the best treatments, in so doing indicating the effect which such treatments are meant to produce and the crises which are going to befall the patient.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, somnambulism displays an incredible range of possibilities that can be used therapeutically, as demonstrated by its capacity to diagnose illnesses, prescribe treatments, and provide beneficial advice based on deep insights into the patients' physical and psychological conditions. Though rare, magnetists and somnambulists possess inexplicable clairvoyance that can be beneficial to others, making them an invaluable resource in the world of medicine."
