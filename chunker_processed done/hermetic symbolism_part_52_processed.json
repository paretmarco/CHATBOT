  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the text, we learned about the symbol for Azoth and its connection to the Empress, the Winged Virgin of the Apocalypse. The symbol is represented by Antimony atop a defeated Crescent or Gem Salt crowned by the Cross, signifying spiritualization and purification. In this final part of the text, we see how mercury acts as a universal mediator between the metals and planets, displaying an androgynous character. Azoth, which is a combination of the Sign of Venus and the Half Moon of Isis, is the base upon which all qualities are formed. This symbol represents the celestial spirit, whose aim is to raise us up and spiritualize us. Ultimately, the Woman, who has become celestial, reigns over the regions of pure intellect.",
  "content": "The Woman, who by her ascension is become celestial, is identified with Venus-Urania, or the Babyloniansâ€™ Ishtar, in this state, as she creates all the idealistic shapes or the idea-types which give order to all of creation. She reigns in the sublime regions of pure intellect, high above the ever-changing sphere of the sub-lunar world, which nevertheless is destined to submit to her in the end. 16 The two forms of mercury It should be noted that mercury , which is characterised as the universal mediator, serves as a link between the other metals or planets, without displaying any particular affinity; hence its neutral, or more precisely, androgynous character, evidenced by the central position that it occupies in the Septenary (See the following page). This means that mercury plays a part in all qualities, that is, it is the base upon which all qualities are begotten, in all their opposing varieties. This is particularly true of that which the hermetists decided to call Azoth , the symbol formed by the Sign of Venus (the Cross of the Egyptians ), crowned by the Half Moon of Isis .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Woman, as celestial Venus-Urania, reigns in the sublime regions of pure intellect and creates all idea-types giving order to creation. Mercury, characterized as the universal mediator, serves as a link between planets and plays a part in all qualities. These symbols carry allusions to fertility, transformations, and generative masculine power, making them essential in understanding the mysteries of creation."
