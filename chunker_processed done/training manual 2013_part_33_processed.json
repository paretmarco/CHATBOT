  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of upper chest breathing and using breath and light together in the context of Mesmerism. In the earlier portion of the text, the author provides instructions on how to inhale properly and discusses how distress while breathing is a result of insufficient relaxation. The author then goes on to explain how inhaling fully, specifically filling the upper part of the lungs, is key in developing the force. Connecting spirituality to breathing, the author explores the concept that the breath of life is compounded of oxygen and a force related to light and consciousness. Finally, the author concludes with the idea that breathing fully helps develop the chest, indicating one's personal courage.",
  "content": "In Animal Magnetism, we breathe health, and the breath of life means that we inhale God's fostering care. We are not sorry to be obliged to bring this idea before you, because it is something unusual for you to reflect upon. This concept will help you to find connection with the universe and spirituality and this is a basic tenet of Mesmerism. Also we can say that the breath of life is compounded of oxygen, and a force that has some intimate relation to light. This force is consciousness. The more you are aware of your breathing and PRESENT, the better results you will achieve. If when breathing, you penetrate with breath the \"frozen\" petrified sensation of the form of the structure of your body, what will emerge is the perception of a luminous mobility. The Chest, the Heart and the Thymus Breathing fully, you are also developing your chest. What you are you indicate by your chest. If you would fight, your chest is advanced; if you dare not fight, your chest retires first.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by paying attention to our breath and developing our consciousness, we can connect with the universe and our spirituality. Also, our chest plays a significant role in reflecting our inner state and emotions. So, let's take a deep breath, be present and embrace the power of the \"breath of life\" in our daily lives."
