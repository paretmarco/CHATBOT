  "content": "In the opinion of Baron Jean du Potet de Sennevoy (1796–1881), the phenomena of magnetism could be explained as follows: “The nervous, active atmosphere of the magnetizer, no doubt augmented by the impulse of his will … enters in rapport with the passive nervous atmosphere of the magnetized person, and augments the latter to the point that, in some cases, it seems that there is a real saturation of the nervous system” (Du Potet, 1868, p. 316). Mesmeric literature The mesmeric literature is vast and varied (Alvarado, 2008; Gauld, 1992, pp. 631–668).” We can count at least 1800 reference books on magnetism and magnetic ideas and other thousands of popular books, as well as many magazines such as “The Zoist” that clearly outline applications of Animal Magnetism. We have read most of these books for the purpose of writing this history of animal magnetism and hypnotism. Two theoretical developments Hypnotism relates to animal magnetism because it normally concentrates more in trying to assume scientific aspects, but even today there are divisions with regards to what it really is (see for example the different opinions of Hilgard, Wagstaff and others).",
