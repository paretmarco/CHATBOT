  "title": "\"The Power of Mirrors in Initiatory Practices\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the importance of maintaining physical and sensory presence, leading to the development of a central principle of presence. The last 200 tokens explore various practices used by ancient fascinators, such as the use of mirrors and jugs to develop sensory perception and \"astral vision.\" Further, the author mentions Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli and his discussion on this phenomenon, as well as the Egyptian tradition linked to the presence of oneself. These practices cultivate energetic sensibility, allowing practitioners to operate not only in the physical dimension but also in an energetic dimension.",
  "content": "In the Western tradition I got in touch with one of my students, the Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, who was a prominent representative of a tradition of Egyptian origin. This tradition is linked to the presence to himself. I had a very long talk with him and I discussed the phenomenon. In the same tradition was the famous Cagliostro, that used a jug of clear water posted on a piece of furniture, and before it a child, on whose head the operator placed one hand and told him the questions to ask, to which replies were given in allegorical pictures. This type of vision, practiced with mirrors, jugs or other tools is also fundamental basis for the work of the Fascinators as it develops a particular energetic sensibility that allows the fascinator to be infallible, because he can operate not only in physical dimension, but also in an energetic dimension not yet fully elucidated by modern science, but no less real in its effects. Here are some notes from the Italian tradition. This tradition is from an ancient origin.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of mirrors and other tools in energetic practices has been a fundamental aspect of many traditions throughout history, including the Italian tradition. By following the steps of the mirror work, as outlined in OPUS 1 - Climbing the Four Stages, one can open their mind to a wider dimension and become more aware of different levels of consciousness. Give it a try and see where it takes you!"
