  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the third stage of initiation, where the hero faces the abyss and overcomes their fears to gain clarity and a sense of cosmic consciousness. In this final chapter of the text, we delve into the fourth stage, where the hero must go beyond the abyss and fully identify with the cosmic consciousness. The text outlines a series of exercises within the first and second chambers, which are aimed at overcoming the ordinary self and reaching a deeper state of consciousness. These exercises include observing oneself in the mirror, working with the elements of water, air, earth and fire, and allowing oneself to be hypnotized. The goal is to climb the highest steps of initiation and uncover the supreme mysteries.",
