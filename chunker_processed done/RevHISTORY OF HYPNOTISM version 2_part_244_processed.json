  "title": "\"The Beneficial Effects of Animal Magnetism in Treating Diseases\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, we will showcase some real-life examples of the application of animal magnetism in the treatment of diseases. Before that, we learned that despite the absence of remarkable physical and psychical magnetic phenomena, the application of animal magnetism produces beneficial effects on the system. Dr. Loewe cited cases where patients recovered from chronic illnesses and hysterical spasms just by repeating the application of animal magnetism. In one case, a lady suffering from convulsions after a violent attack of fever recovered after being magnetized for eight weeks.",
  "content": "\"A gentleman, thirty-five years of age, had laboured for many years under a chronic disease, which sometimes presented itself in the form of head-ache, particularly on one side of the head, and sometimes as an hypochondriac affection: after having made use of all the medicines usual in such diseases without effect, he was magnetized. For three weeks, during which time the animal magnetism was daily repeated, there was no remarkable difference in his case, but in the fourth week the symptoms of the first degree of magnetism presented themselves, and he was brought to the state of sleeping; and after the daily repetition of animal magnetism during the space of eight weeks, he recovered without any other phenomenon taking place. \"114 \"A lady residing in London, after a violent attack of fever, under which she was suffering in the months of December and January last, was affected by convulsions of every kind, but mostly by fainting, which often lasted two hours, and it was difficult to bring her to herself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while animal magnetism was often viewed as a diabolical agent by some of its opponents, these examples showcase the potential effectiveness of this practice in treating chronic diseases and convulsions. As with any medical treatment, it's important to explore all options and proceed with caution, but the success stories of these individuals suggest that animal magnetism could have practical applications in certain cases."
