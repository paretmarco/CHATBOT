  "title": "Understanding Consciousness: The Illusion of Knower and Known.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, it was discussed how consciousness gives the illusion of a separate subject and object, leading to trauma when the knower resists its own disappearance. In the last 200 tokens, the focus shifts to practical exercises for achieving advanced attention training. These exercises come from the Tao of Chaos and involve noticing memories and emotions, observing the observer, and ultimately seeing the observer and the thought/emotion as made of the same consciousness. This is a key step in understanding the unity of consciousness and further reducing trauma.",
  "content": "Consciousness gives the illusion that the knower of \"inconsiderate partner\" and the knowledge called \"inconsiderate partner\" are different. Actually consciousness is both the knower and the knowledge. Trauma occurs when the knower resists its own disappearance by imagining it (the knower) and the known are made of different substancesâ€”not the same consciousness. Stated another way, if the knower understands that it and the knowing are the same consciousness, then the knower and the known (I-dentity) disappear, because there can only be a knower and an I-dentity as long as there is a subject/object relationship or contrasts. Advanced Attention Training, Part IV ________________ Step IV See the observer and the thought as being made of the same consciousness. Tao of Chaos Exercise #57 Step INotice a memory. Step IINotice the observer of the memory. Step III Is the observer giving attention to the thought, receiving attention from the thought, or exchanging attention with the thought? Step IV See the observer and the memory as being made of the same consciousness. Tao of Chaos Exercise #58 Step INotice an emotion. Step IINotice the observer of the emotion.",
  "last_phrase": "By understanding that \"knower\" and \"known\" are the same consciousness, we can move beyond trauma and create a new awareness. These exercises offer steps to cultivate this kind of consciousness and connect the observer and observed. With practice, we can move towards a more integrated and harmonious state of being."
