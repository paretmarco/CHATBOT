  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, the focus is on the continued development of the experiment, which involves visualizing figures in one's mind's eye and gradually bringing them into sharper focus. This process requires persistence and focus on the part of the operator, who may encounter hallucinations and other obstacles along the way. The ultimate goal is to reach a state of heightened perception, where the world is seen in a new and glorious light. However, this path is not without its dangers, and the operator must be vigilant at all times. The importance of feeling a vague sense of vertigo is emphasized, as it is a crucial step in the process of transcending everyday consciousness.",
  "content": "DREAMS If the individual is capable to persist, and not to retract, and even intensify the strength of the experiment, then, gradually, in absolute darkness one may be able to see of forming a small slight bright center. This will gradually shine until it will take over the dark. So a wonderful new world will open up to the human perception that if it can be satiated by many splendours and magnificent things, must also stay firm, impassible before the monstruosities and horrors without a name that you could see. CONTINUING THE PATH But the trials and dangers have not stopped, the goal is still far away and the path becomes increasingly difficult. Hallucinations of many types could be seen and we transcend near a dream world, but we must absolutely not fall inside it. Other observations of a more profound and interior level need to be done, especially noting a vague feeling of vertigo already slightly experienced in earlier stages. The operator must in the first steps fight it and dominate it, then at a succesive step a change of perception will be necessary, and the only possibility is to let it be there to persist and being beyond it. Feeling it in a slight and barely noticeable way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving lucid dreaming in a waking state requires persistence, courage, and a willingness to confront both the splendors and horrors of the subconscious mind. However, the rewards of this journey are worth the effort, as a new world of perception and awareness opens up, allowing us to transcend our ego and experience life in a fundamentally different way. Keep practicing and stay steadfast on your path towards lucidity."
