  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discussed the importance of a mesmerist's ability to read character and manipulate it skillfully for public entertainments. Now, we delve into the necessary qualities of a successful mesmerist, who must possess not only faith in their own abilities but also a sharp awareness of their audience. They must have control over both themselves and their subjects, and have the ability to turn failures into undoubted success. However, they must also be prepared for clever individuals who may attempt to sabotage their performances with hidden signals to confederates in the audience.",
  "content": "He may be nervous and anxious; his audience may be small in numbers, ignorant or sceptical but be this as they may, he must have perfect control over himself, and ability; to have full control over his audience. If he is not able either to control or entertain his audience, all his hope for success as an exhibitor or entertainer will be seriously shaken by failure. For confidence begets confidence, and success. To succeed, he must not only be a good mesmerist, possess the utmost faith in his own powers, but he must be a usually wide-awake person, adding to firmness, will resolution, ready fact, and keenness of observation, and thereby have complete command of his audience, as well as his subjects. He will often require to avert disaster, and either minimise failures, or turn them into undoubtable success. Occasionally some very clever people may come upon the platform, assume to be mesmerised, and up to a certain stage appear to do their part well, at the same time, when opportunity occurs they will make cabalistic signs with their thumb fingers, and nose behind the operator's back to their confederates in the audience.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to succeed as an exhibitor or entertainer in mesmerism, one must have perfect control over oneself and their audience. Confidence begets confidence and success. The ability to detect fraud and turn failures into undoubtable success is vital. With firmness, resolution, ready fact, keenness of observation, and complete command of the audience and subjects, one can continue to amuse and entertain their audience with profitable results."
