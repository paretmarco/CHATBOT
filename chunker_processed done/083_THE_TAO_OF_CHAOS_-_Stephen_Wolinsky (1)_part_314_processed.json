  "first_phrase": "In this final section, a therapist guides a client through a visualization exercise to help them detach from a traumatic memory. The text emphasizes the importance of integrating body therapy into psychotherapy, as the body not only holds memories but also demonstrates how a person moves in the world. The client learns to recognize themselves as the observer of memories, rather than being fused with them. The exercise brings relief and the therapist notes the client's understanding that they are more than their stories.",
  "content": "Therapist: Now diagonally from bottom right to upper left. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now run the film diagonally from bottom left to upper right. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now make it into a yo-yo. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now decide it was the most important situation in your life. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now decide it was a situation that occurred. Client: Okay. Therapist: How are you doing? Client: Much freer, cleaner, relieved. Therapist: Is it okay if we stop here? Client: Yes. Therapeutic Note The last section is done this way to give the client the understanding that they (the observer) exist before the memory in their mind, during the memory, and the same observer will exist after the memory leaves. I said to a client after the memory left, \"Well, I guess you're not your mind.\" She looked startled and nonverbally confused. I said, \"You're still here, even though the story is not, therefore you are not your story.\" Observers hold the movie in their mind unknowingly, and fuse with the trauma.",
  "last_phrase": "By giving an observer a way to detach from traumatic memories and experience the present, trauma becomes a story that can be put down. The therapist can guide clients in achieving this by following a process like that outlined in the post-traumatic stress disorder outline part I."
