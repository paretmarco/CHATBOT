  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author discussed the nature of the four classical elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - and their mutual antagonism. In the final 200 tokens, the author elaborates on how individual existence stems from an internal center of initiative and expansive action, inspired by radical egoism that opposes everything else. The concept of \"Sulphur\" is introduced in this context. The author also explains how each element interacts with one another, such as how Water acts as a squeezing force against the upward force of Fire. This final section provides a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of existence and how it originates from the interplay between the classical elements.",
  "content": "Nothing is left but smoke, vapour or gas, a substance that diffuses and extends in all directions, in the same way as Water. 17 Earth is a weighty, densified version of Water, that no longer flows in its cycle and has attained complete inertia in its solid form. 18 Though we will take the opportunity here to expand upon the theory of mutual, reciprocal antagonism between the Elements, we will limit ourselves to summarising the relationships between them with the help of the relevant image from the previous page. Sulphur Whichever realm they may belong to, every individual always originates from an internal centre of initiative and expansive action. In fact, all individual existence has its origins in this first rebellion, inspired by radical egoism that sets itself against everything else that will, nevertheless, play a part in its life. If we begin by looking at this general life force, we should remind ourselves that it transmits its vibrations, from all places simultaneously, to the still passive substance that will later awaken individual life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the theory of mutual antagonism between the Elements, the centrality of individual existence, and the origin of Sulphur can all be traced back to the life force radiation that transmits its vibrations and establishes the constructive principle of every living organism. Understanding this universal force can help us better comprehend the interconnectedness of all things and our own place in the world."
