  "title": "\"The Magnetic Healing Theory and Puysegur's Discovery\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the concept of magnetism and its effects on the human body. It was discussed how magnetic passes could alleviate pain and bring equilibrium to the body. Now, we will delve deeper into the technique devised by the Marquis de Puysegur, who made a mysterious discovery at the Chateau de Buzancy. He believed in the presence of a magnetic fluid in the body which could be directed by the magnetizer. This theory differed from the earlier concept of a universal fluid proposed by Mesmer. Let's discover more about Puysegur's technique and the mystery surrounding it.",
  "content": "Puysegur and his mysterious discovery Chateau de Buzancy “To feel, one needs neither intellect nor science, and Magnetism is felt better than it can be expressed” De Puysegur Puysegur technique I will now give you the theory of the Magnetic fluid, with the method of directing that fluid as adopted by the Marquis de Puysegur, for if you can grasp the spirit of the idea, it will greatly assist you in formulating your Will-power when practicing. Mesmer's theory is based on the concept of something through which everything in the universe is interconnected. It is something before matter. Lacking other terms, he called it a universal fluid Changes in theory As Mesmer left the scene, the theory of the universal fluid underwent a considerable modification, inasmuch as the agent was soon believed by the Magnetiser to be a peculiar vital fluid, secreted or accumulated more or less in the brain, and of which the nerves acted as conductors. This fluid was described as being subservient to the Will of the Magnetiser, who by his act of volition could control its influence, propel it externally or internally, and direct it so as to accumulate in any part of the living body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Marquis de Puysegur's discovery of the Magnetic fluid and his technique of directing it resulted in the remarkable phenomenon of somnambulism. Understanding this concept can greatly assist in formulating one's will-power when practicing. While the theory of the universal fluid has undergone changes over time, Puysegur's method of magnetism remains a fascinating chapter in the history of medical science."
