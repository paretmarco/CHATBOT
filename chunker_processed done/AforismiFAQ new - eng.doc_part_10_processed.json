  "title": "Mesmerismus © and its Relationship with NLP, Quantum Techniques, and the Body",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between mesmerismus © and various other disciplines, including Neuro-Linguistic Programming and quantum techniques. Dr. Paret, who has developed a specific method to help people reconnect with their inward being and achieve balance, is heavily involved in all three areas. The previous section details how students can become initiated into an ancient and secret hermetic tradition of self-development, while this final section focuses on how magnetism and non-verbal communication can complement verbal hypnosis. The denser, non-verbal aspects of communication can help individuals achieve greater balance and connection with their essential inward identity.",
  "content": "There is quite a close connection indeed. Nay, modern quantum concepts are actually strengthened by mesmerismus ©. That is so, in particular, of the concept of entanglement, which has a strict correspondence with what we can ascertain during the so-called “magnetic action”, which is an action that can even take place at a distance. Dr. Paret participates in a network of researchers on quantum disciplines. How can magnetism complement verbal hypnosis? Hypnosis as currently practiced is essentially verbal. Magnetism and mesmerismus © are non-verbal. Words are endowed with a lower density than gestures. What is non-verbal is denser than the verbal. The self, the ego, is primarily verbal, whereas one’s inward being is mostly non-verbal. The body is non-verbal. The more one is in touch with one’s essential inward identity, the greater is the balance which is thus established. Repossessing the body is the path leading one back to his essential being. This is something that for the western man sometimes is difficult to understand. Dr, Paret has therefore developed a specific method to help people to go in this direction. The methods works very well because we see many of our students practicing with efficacity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of mesmerismus © and magnetism in conjunction with verbal hypnosis can increase the effectiveness of hypnotherapy. By focusing on the non-verbal aspects of communication, such as gestures and body language, a deeper level of understanding and connection can be achieved, leading to greater balance and resolution of issues. Dr. Paret's specific method has shown success among his students and provides simple, rapid, and effective techniques for those seeking to repossess their body and tap into their essential inward identity."
