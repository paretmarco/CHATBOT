  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author introduces a third variation to the therapeutic process of reabsorbing emotions and identities back into one's essence. The client is asked to intentionally place a mother mask over the face of his wife to make the implicit explicit and add awareness to the process. The fixation of attention strategy called The Devil's Advocate, The Loyalist, and The Persecuted Prosecutor is explored, which characterizes a rebel with an underlying state of ambivalence and fear. This is the compensated oral character type who can pretend to be heroic to hide the fear.",
  "content": "IF YOU SEE ME AS THE AUTHORITY, • 11161 YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU SEE ME ZAS THE AUTHORITY OR W4 WI'M O.K. IF I'M REBELLIOUS, Pm U. YOU'RE O.K. IF YOU ACCEPT ME NU 0 FOR BEING REBELLIOUS Z his fixation of attention strategy is call- ZVed The Devil's Advocate by Palmer, the ILIloyalist by Riso, and the persecuted per- pmsecutor by Naranjo. This rebel is in a constant state of ambivalence. Naranjo actually calls this fixation of attention the ambivilants. This * m.fixation characterizes either a rebellion (rebel I-dentity) and a fusion with authority figures VI) (authority I-dentity). On one side of this Identity structure is a rebel with an underlying state of ambivalence and fear, not really knowing what he/she stands for, but defending against people knowing that. The fixation of attention is on fear, and since the underlying state and the fixation of attention are similar, this makes fear the constant companion and mechanism through which everything is seen. 216 • THE TAO OF CHAOS This is the character type of the compensated oral who can pretend being heroic to hide the fear. Often this type barely feels the fear, but instead feels angry.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the rebel and authority identities, as well as the fear and anger that accompany them, can provide valuable insights into one's own personality as well as those around them. By recognizing and acknowledging these fixations of attention, one can begin to move towards a more integrated and balanced sense of self, free from the constant companion of fear."
