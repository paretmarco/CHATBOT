Virgilio's techniques help people feel better, filled with energy, and achieve their goals. In this last part, we will delve into the life and work of Prof. Erminio di Pisa, a well-known personality with exceptional charm, energy, and expertise in instant hypnosis and healing. He has hypnotized over 250,000 people and gained recognition through his numerous parapsychic exploits, including distance paranormal healing and announcing horse racing results before they even started. He kindly welcomed us at his Milan residence, and we can't wait to share his fascinating insights with you.",

He chaired the Astrological Association of the Light since 1973, and acted as director of the Centre of Instant Hypnosis. At the age of 14, he fully devoted himself to the study of hypnotic techniques. He has hypnotized more than 250.000 persons. For several years, both the Italian state-owned radio and television have shown us his parapsychic exploits: Collective hypnosis of a theatre audience, distance paranormal healing, announcing the final result of the “Corsa Tris”, a horseracing event, fifteen minutes before it even started, and so on. He was a very expansive person, full of energy. His residence was in Milan, close to Corso Sempione, in the heart of that city. He consented to our visit after merely making a phone call to him.",
