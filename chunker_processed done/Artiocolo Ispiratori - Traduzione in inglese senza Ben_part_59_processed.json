  "first_phrase": "This text explores the battle between ruling academy and magnetists, and the acceptance of alternative therapeutic approaches such as naturopathy and magnetism. It analyzes conflicting opinions surrounding the simplest explanations of phenomena related to these alternative therapies, and delves into the theory of Mesmer, which has points in common with quantum theory. The last 200 tokens focus on Vincenzo Campanelli's anti-smoking method, which claims to cure smoking addiction in under a minute using magnetism. Campanelli's methodology has been derived from Herman Michel, a Swiss who worked in Antwerp, Seon, and Lugano's canton. The methodology has had astounding results and has been corroborated by unimpeachable testimonies.",
  "content": "For exemple Mesmer suppose the existence of a level where everything is connected, that he called “the level of fluid”. The world in which we live in is just an expression of this level. Mind in its wholeness can touch and influence this deeper level where instant communication is possible, and everything is flux even if at a broader level we see a fixed universe. 4 – ANTI-SMOKING METHOD: ADVOCATE CAMPANELLI – MICHEL HERMAN ”50 seconds to quit smoking forever” Is it possible to quit smoking forever in less than a minute? Smoking and addictions are indeed amenable to being cured by magnetism in the shortest possible time. This is what Campanelli’s methodology proves. The originator of such method is Vincenzo Campanelli, who passed away recently. He in turn derived it from Herman Michel, a Swiss who used to work in Antwerp, in Seon, and in Lugano’s canton. Campanelli’s fame, punctuated by astounding results and corroborated by unimpeachable testimonies, appears to be truly unassailable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you're struggling to quit smoking and searching for an effective solution, you may want to try Campanelli's anti-smoking method, which has been proven to work in just 50 seconds according to numerous compelling testimonies. It's a unique and remarkable approach that has helped individuals from all walks of life quit their smoking habit for good."
