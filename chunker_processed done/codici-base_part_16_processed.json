This advanced level doesn't require specific instructions, and those interested can attend original seminars held in Italy and other countries to learn how to handle the appropriate use of superior techniques. The section also includes an introduction and an index of the previous topics covered, including the ten theories behind language, the syntax of basic codes, and practical uses.",
