  "title": "\"Beyond 3D: Changing perceptions through elemental meditation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses different ways of changing perception beyond our three-dimensional view. In the last 200 tokens, the author presents a series of exercises that can allow us to go beyond the limitations of ordinary consciousness. These exercises involve changing our perception to different elements such as stone, water, air, and fire. By repeating these exercises, we can wash away the automatic tensions and reactions that limit us. The author argues that we need to go beyond ordinary consciousness to perceive that the space around us is a construct of our senses, and what we call mass or energy is the same. The ancients compared this process of creation to the cooling of water, with the formless whole being like a cloud. The last part of the text provides relevant concepts and names, such as the four elements, the ocean of philosophers, and the process of getting information from the universe.",
  "content": "Being air. understanding there is no inside and no outside. In relaxing this is a process that can easily happen afte a while. We can even imagine air exiting from us. Being fire. Concentration on the earth while breathing and everything will be burnt away in the central concentration. These are changes in perceptions that we have also in our life while we are emotionated for exemple. Repeating this exercise multiple time will wash away the concretions of automatic tensions and reactions. We must go beyond ordinary consciousness even in our daily life. Staying so much in our senses to be able to begin to feel that space around us is in reality a construct of our senses, and what we call mass or energy is the same. A comparison to understand the four elements The ancients also compared this process of creation to the cooling of water. We could imagine the formless whole, the ocean of the philosophers, as a cloud. What we see as “reality” is like a process of getting information from it as a cooling down. (In any case, the cloud is not the ultimate state, but it is already the perceivable state of energy of the universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing perception-altering exercises such as imagining ourselves as elements or meditating on the mystery of the universe as a cloud, we can expand our consciousness beyond the limitations of ordinary perception. By doing so, we may discover a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, possibly leading to therapeutic benefits or even new insights in the field of quantum physics."
