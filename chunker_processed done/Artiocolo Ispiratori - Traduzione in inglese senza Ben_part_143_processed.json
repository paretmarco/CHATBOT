  "title": "\"Rewriting Memories: A Method to Overcome Fear\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, we delved into the impact of fear and anxiety on the mind and body, sparked by traumatic events. We explored how people who undergo anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress suffer from bad experiences anchored in their minds. In the last 200 tokens, we examine an experiment that proved recalling a terrible memory before writing over it promptly can reduce the fear. The study was carried out by showing some volunteers coloured squares and associating them with light electric shocks, making them scared. Let's dive deeper into this research, which could be a game-changer for managing anxiety and fear.",
  "content": "Let us illustrate it with an example: If a man from Abruzzo in Italy, who had experienced the earthquake which shook that region, senses some minor readjustment shakes, it is highly probable, in spite of the fact that such negligible shakes pose no danger, that he is going to feel panic and hasten to take shelter in a tent, merely through his recollection of the tragic night of the past 6th of April. Muscular tensions, too, are purely reminiscences of significant events which have become “embedded” in the body, in the light of the fact that a tension of the body might correspond to some mental tension. The said study has been carried out by inducing a state of fear in some volunteers who chose to be tested. That state of fear was engineered by showing them some coloured squares and by associating with them a light electrical shock by their wrists, a shock which was merely annoying without being painful.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our bodies have a remarkable ability to retain memories of significant events and react instinctively to stimuli associated with them. However, with the right training and intervention, these fears can be overcome within a short period. It is therefore important to seek professional help as soon as possible to reduce the risk of long-term retention of traumatic memories."
