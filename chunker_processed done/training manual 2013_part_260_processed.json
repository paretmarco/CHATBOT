  "title": "Breathing and Muscle Exercises for Magnetism and Energy",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author touches upon the benefits of deep breathing exercises. In the last part (200 tokens), the author introduces a second exercise that works on muscle tension, which helps increase magnetism. The exercise involves lifting up arms while inhaling and then bending down to touch the floor with fingertips, before exhaling while standing. The author notes that this exercise, while causing initial dizziness, ensures the air enters each particle of the lungs. Overall, regular benefits will not only benefit one's health but also provide magnetic energy to the body and mind.",
  "content": "This is simply because some parts of the body, especially of the lungs, which remained inactive for a long time, are now put into use. There is no exercise able to force the air to get in each particle of the lungs, as the one described above. It will take you no more than one minute each morning to perform this exercise, and a few days will be enough to convince the student that the benefits obtained are great. Not only is of great benefit to health, but also infuses to both, body and spirit, a magnetic energy not obtainable in other way. The key of muscle tension Let us act now on the muscles. These are the fundamental keys to increase progressively the magnetism. The mind works on the muscular system, but the latter can act upon the mind too. Characteristic of the work done with muscles is the nervous effort. Nervous effort activates a series of reactions in mind as well as physical exertion increases muscle mass.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating one simple exercise into your morning routine can lead to great health benefits and an increase in magnetic energy. By acting on the muscles through tension, you can release this energy and increase muscle mass. Give it a few days and you'll see the amazing impact it can have on both your body and spirit."
