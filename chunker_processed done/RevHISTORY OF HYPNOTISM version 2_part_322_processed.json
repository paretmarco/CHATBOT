  "title": "\"How did Baron Dupotet use magnetism to cure epilepsy? What was the role of distance in the cure?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The final section of the text describes a powerful technique for inducing sleep and increasing sensitivity to distance. The author recommends changing one's breathing and moving away from the subject in order to test for a change in breathing, which may indicate the practitioner's ability to influence the subject from a distance. The text also includes an example of Baron Dupotet de Sennevoy's cure for epilepsy, involving the application of a seton to the neck.",
  "content": "They say, that they always thought he was very near to them. An example of Dupotet’s cure in curing epilepsy REPORT OF THE CASE OF LUCY CLARK, TREATED BY BARON DUPOTET DE SENNEVOY, AT NO. 20, WIGMORE STREET, CAVENDISH SQUARE. COMMUNICATED BY GEORGE DENTON, ESQ., SURGEON, TOTTENHAM. Lucy Clark is eighteen years old. In her thirteenth year she was suddenly seized with a fit, for which she could assign no cause. A fortnight afterwards she had a second; in her fourteenth year she had a third; and in her sixteenth year a fourth, when she became so constantly subject to them, that for three months she scarcely passed two days without a fit. During this time many remedies were administered; at last a seton was applied to the neck, and for the four months it was allowed to remain there she had no recurrence of her fits. The seton had scarcely been removed a fortnight when her fits returned. For one month various remedies were tried, which failing, the seton was re-applied, and worn for seventeen months.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dupotet’s cure has shown remarkable success in treating Lucy Clark's epilepsy, with the use of seton and magnetism. If you or someone you know is suffering from epilepsy, it may be worth exploring Dupotet's method as a potential treatment option."
