  "title": "The Tao of Chaos: Reabsorbing I-dentities into Essence",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text of \"The Tao of Chaos,\" the author discusses the concept of Essence, which, when allowed, can reabsorb the personality back into itself. The author suggests examining our I-dentities and personalities fearlessly to be completely reabsorbed. However, in the last 200 tokens, the author stresses the importance of facing the truth about the lies we tell ourselves. The author gives an example of working with a woman who complained about a man not giving enough attention, but upon questioning, she realized that she had lied to herself about his true nature. The author emphasizes that lies cannot be absorbed into Essence, and only truth can allow for the reabsorption of I-dentities.",
  "content": "We must tell the truth about our lies. Why? Essence can only absorb the truth - it cannot absorb lies. For example, I was working with a woman on the East ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 145 Coast at a workshop who described herself as a \"love addict.\" She complained about a man that she was seeing, saying \"He doesn't give me enough attention.\" I said to her, \"You knew he was not right for you in the beginning of the relationship, and then lied to yourself about it; what lie did you tell yourself about him?\" She first got huffy about the question and then said, \"Well, I was supposed to meet him at the restaurant at 8:00. He didn't show until 8:45. I kept lying to myself about that.\" I explained that in a relationship we lie to ourselves about a person, and then we lie that we lied to ourselves. We then get angry with the person because they are different than the lie we told ourselves about the way they were.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly understand and heal from our past trauma and relationships, it is essential that we stop lying to ourselves and face the truth head on. By acknowledging the reality of our experiences, we can move forward and reconnect with our true Essence. Honesty may be difficult, but it is the key to personal growth and a fulfilling life."
