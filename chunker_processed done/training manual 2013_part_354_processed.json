  "title": "Understanding Time: Perception, Conceptualization and Essence",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of time and how it is perceived by ancient people and modern humans. Prior to this, the author discusses the authority of Saturn in perceiving time’s rigidity and how it is measured. However, at the level of accessing the sensorium commune, perception changes and reality appears more fluid. Despite the importance of programing time for daily tasks, such conceptualization is created by the mind and can change. The last 200 tokens suggest that reaching the quintessence can be accomplished through relaxation or hypnosis, allowing individuals to occupy an enlarged space before their senses.",
  "content": "What is important to understand at this point is that time is born as the product of a process of a mental character, and can thus, precisely for that reason, “change”, expand and contract, as we can experientally ascertain in life. Accordingly, one moment might encompass the passing of days or hours, and, what is more than that, time might even stop. Perceiving and intuitively feeling the essence Reaching the quintessence in our daily life is a long journey which necessitates the actualization of all we have laid out before. However, perceiving the essence is possible to be accomplished even before that stage. Such achievement would prove useful to the objective of proceeding along the path better 103. When, for instance, we are in a state of relaxation, or, through the medium of hypnotic methods, we sometimes develop an “intuition” of what the essence is, we might find ourselves in a “free”, “enlarged” space which we occupy “before” our senses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that time is a mental construct that can change, expand, and contract can help us perceive and intuitively feel the essence of life. Achieving this understanding may require a long journey, but it is possible to experience moments of intuition through relaxation or other methods such as progressive relaxation and concentrating on the navel. Practicing these methods with maximum presence to our bodily sensations can aid us in proceeding along the path towards reaching the quintessence of our daily life."
