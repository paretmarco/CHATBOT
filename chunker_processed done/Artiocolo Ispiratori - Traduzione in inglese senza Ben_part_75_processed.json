From the book “Guaritori Internazionali” (“International Healers”), edited by Dante Alighieri Editions: “One minute spent with him (Herman Michel) causes the desire to smoke to disappear. Without suffering relapses, at least in respect of seventy per cent of those who did consult him. One single minute and ten thousand liras: They are enough to cure even the most unflinching smoker.",
