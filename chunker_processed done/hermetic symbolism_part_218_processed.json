  "title": "\"Hermetic Principles: Understanding Reality from a Quantistical View\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we explore the concept of the elixir of long life and its connection to man's gradual improvement. The drinkable gold in liquid form is believed to signify wisdom and perfection, while the dust of projection represents power or wealth of the spirit. The inextinguishable light is acknowledged as a way of transcending time, leading to a state of absolute transcendence. We also examine the taumaturgic ability to heal others, which is closely related to magneticism and a stage of perfection of the work. Finally, we discuss the hermetic and quantistical views of Hermetism, emphasizing the importance of understanding it as a way to achieve a superior understanding of reality and awakening to what the human being should be.",
  "content": "the said absolute state of transcending time The taumaturgic ability (being the capacity to heal others). We can observe in this regard that Franz Anton Mesmer clearly asserts that he distilled his methodology from earlier tautmaturgic techniques of an alchemical type. It follows that such a taumaturgic capability is somehow closely related to what was later given the name of “magneticism”, and which is implicit in man once the stage of perfection of the Work has been reached, as per the alchemical maxim VITRIOLUM, the meaning of which is Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occulta Lapidem Unicam Medicinam (“visit the interior part of the earth, and you will then discover the hidden tombstone, the sole medicine”). For the sake of our experience, such a capacity gets more and more refined as one journeys ahead. Hermetic view and quantistic view Hermetism has been interpreted by many people, under the psychoanalytical point of view, or under mechanical points of view (Berthelot was one of the first ones). Having experienced it, we believe that hermetism must be understood under a quantistical point of view. As a way to achieve a superior understanding of reality, anawakening to what the human being really should be.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the taumaturgic ability to heal others is closely related to the alchemical concept of magneticism, which can be refined as one progresses on the journey of the Work. Understanding Hermetism under a quantistical point of view can lead to a superior understanding of reality and the awakening of one's true being. The circle symbolizes the unity of existence and thought, and the journey towards it starts from the heart."
