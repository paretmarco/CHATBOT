  "title": "\"Chaos Theory: Explaining Repetitive Patterns in Belief Structures\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article delves into Chaos Theory and how it relates to the self-organizing and patterned experiences in our lives. The author explains that belief structures act as control parameters for our behaviour and create boundaries of experience within our subjective psyche. They use an example of a friend who is always late and how their belief structure creates a pattern within a pattern which is self-similar. The article explores this concept in-depth and draws on physics to explain how self-similarity operates at an atomic level.",
  "content": "________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 37 \"The notion of self-similarity strikes ancient cords in our culture...Beliefs that a drop of water contained a whole teeming universe, containing in turn, water drops and new universes within. \"To see the world in a grain of sand.\" Blake wrote, and often scientists were predisposed to see it.\" (Chaos: Making a New Science, James Gleick, Penguin Books, p. 115.) Let's use a physics explanation. Let's say there is an atom. This atom has a nucleus (self) and two electrons (beliefs) spinning around it. This single atom is surrounded by empty space. The self (nucleus) is self-organizing in that it only allows into the self (nucleus) other electrons (beliefs) and atoms which agree with or are compatible with its basic structure. If an atom with different electrons enters its path, it creates chaos, because the two systems don't match in that they are not compatible. At a sub-atomic level, the atoms join together forming a molecule. For example, an atom of oxygen and atom of hydrogen when they meet form H2O (water).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, self-similarity has a profound impact on our culture and beliefs, as it reflects the basic structure of the universe at all levels. Understanding the self-organizing principles of atoms and molecules can help us navigate chaos and find a deeper understanding of the world, rather than closing ourselves off to new experiences and ideas."
