In the final 200 tokens, Deleuze reveals some of the effects that can be achieved through the mesmerist's touch, including catalepsy. Additionally, Deleuze emphasizes the power of the mesmerist's gaze, stating that it can significantly amplify the effects of the touch and will. The text also provides step-by-step instructions on how to establish a connection with the patient and move the hands along the body to induce a trance-like state.",

You will then commence the passes or downward movements of the hands; at a little distance from the body over the face and chest, to about as far as the pit of the stomach; sweeping them off a little before re-ascending; then descend slowly along the body as far as the knees, and if convenient to the ends of the feet—you may repeat the processes during the greater part of the sitting. \"— Deleuze. 7.
