  "content": "They find themselves hemmed in by mountains, and they regard those mountains as natural barriers, beyond which lays the empire of fraud and delusion, peopled by dreadful monsters of the imagination. I want to help them to take a bird's eye view, if not of the whole great continent on which they have landed, at least of the part of it into, which the explorer is likely to venture, so that they may learn where their rivers rise and end, and know what lies beyond the mountains that now form their horizon. There are many clever men at present engaged in the exploration of Hypnotism, who have already extracted from their limited ground much that is of practical utility, but I am convinced that until they know what lies beyond the limits within which they now confine their investigations, they will be empiricists, whose theories only serve to blindfold them, and who wander round in a circle, mistaking each other for enemies when they meet.",
