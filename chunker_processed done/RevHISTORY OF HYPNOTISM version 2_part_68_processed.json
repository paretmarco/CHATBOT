  "content": "From an initial platform of qualities which were already of an eminently higher calibre, as he was knowledgeable, an artist, humorous, amiable and handsome, he further acquired at that stage an extraordinary hold on the frequenters of salons.

No man, particularly a foreigner, boasted a power comparable to his in the whole of France; he used to deal with reigning monarchs as one of their peers.",
