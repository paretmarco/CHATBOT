  "title": "\"The Tetraktys: Understanding Occult Medicine and Initiation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the basics of Occult Medicine. This science of healthcare requires an understanding of mankind beyond what modern science can explain. It employs means that may seem irrational to outsiders, but were analyzed and inspired by traditional science and ancient sages. However, this knowledge is not for the foolhardy. Aspiring to such knowledge requires certain physical, moral, and intellectual conditions. We discuss the Occult Sciences, a labyrinth in which valiant spirits may reach enlightenment, but only after enduring arduous tests. Before this, we examine a table with symbolic representations of the most important elements and concepts in Occult Medicine.",
  "content": "There are certain conditions of an intellectual, moral and physical kind that must be fulfilled by those who aspire to lifting the veil of the mysteries that prudent Nature hides from the eyes of common mortals. The Occult Sciences constitute a labyrinth in which the foolhardy one who embarks on the adventure without adequate preparation will be lost. He puts his sanity, his physiological equilibrium, and his health at risk, not to mention his destiny and the salvation of his soul. This does not mean that the Initiation may not be undertaken by valiant spirits who accept the risks therein. Those who have the vocation will reach enlightenment, but they will have to endure arduous tests. We do not have in mind here the ceremonies, which may be more or less strange and terrifying, of the initiatic associations, nor the exams to which the candidates of the profane schools are subjected. To make oneself initiable is desirable, both for the spirit and for truth; if one limits oneself to appearances and external forms, the result will be no more than a deceitful illusion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the path towards enlightenment through the Occult Sciences is not for the faint-hearted. Adequate preparation, both intellectual and physical, is essential to avoid the risk of losing one's sanity, physiological equilibrium, health, destiny, and even the salvation of one's soul. However, those with the true vocation can navigate the difficult tests and reach their goal. It is essential to pursue real knowledge and truth and avoid becoming deceived by false magic or prideful arrogance, which can corrupt even the best intentions."
