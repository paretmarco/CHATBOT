  "first_phrase": "This text details the benefits of daily exercises prescribed by Dr. Hanish, which can aid in improving digestion, concentration, and the refinement of senses. By building a stronger character and outgrowing unhealthy habits, one can attain a more harmonious existence, free from the filth and degradation of negative vices. In this final part, Dr. Hanish discusses how a purity of body leads to a purity of mind, and ultimately leads to a more elevated nature with an aversion to gossip and hypocrisy.",
  "content": "You must necessarily build up a character that will be strong enough to see the folly of your position, and help to overcome all evil habits in a perfectly natural way by simply out growing them, until you find yourself freed, never again to wallow in their filth and degradation. In time you will become very particular as to what you eat and drink, taste or smell, because of the extreme delicacy of the senses. The odor of liquor or tobacco, and the effluvium of burning grease and flesh will become nauseating because you have been lifted to a higher plane, where purity of food and environment are necessary for a harmonious existence. Purity of body will produce purity of mind, and the ideas flowing therefrom will be of an elevating nature. There will no longer be a desire to enter into conversation about the neighbors and acquaintances, and associations with gossip and hypocrisy will be strenuously shunned. Selfishness will be overcome and harmony with nature and all mankind will prevail.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, building a strong character that thrives on purity of body and mind is key to overcoming bad habits and achieving a harmonious existence. By embracing this way of life, you'll find yourself naturally outgrowing those things that once held you back, and soaring to greater heights of happiness and fulfillment. So keep standing tall, balancing your weight on the balls of your feet, and enjoy the lightness and joy that come with a life of harmony and purity."
