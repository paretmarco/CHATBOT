  "title": "\"Reabsorbing I-Dentities into the Essence: Therapy and Diagnosis\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"Essence\" and how it can help individuals overcome their \"I-dentities\" to reach a permanent state of being. The previous tokens describe how the \"I-dentities\" seek essential qualities, such as love or perfection, and even though their strategies may fail, the pendulum keeps moving. The \"Essence\" is where a state becomes a permanent station, such as love without an object. Through diagnostic procedures like character analysis and the enneagram, individuals can work to reabsorb their \"I-dentities\" into the \"Essence.\" Highlighted case examples and exercises are provided to illustrate this therapeutic process.",
  "content": "For example, you might experience a state of love for another. Soon, though, this I-dentity, which is in the state of love, moves like a pendulum to a state of hate. Both ________________ I-dentities have a state associated with them, i.e., love or hate. The Essence, however, which appears as a gnawing emptiness in the body, contains a permanent station of love with no object. This means rather than being an I-dentity in love, you reside at the level of Essence; which is love. When this occurs, the I-dentities can be reabsorbed into the Essence, and hence love moves from being a state of consciousness to a station of Essence. Simply put, the Essence is where a state becomes a station. This is the therapy. In order to begin however, we will use the two forms of diagnosis: one, character analysis and, two, the enneagram as our diagnostic procedure. Highlighted case examples are presented and exercises offered in order to illustrate how to work with others as well as with oneself with this reabsorption process.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by recognizing and integrating the concept of Essence, one can move beyond the fluctuating states of love and hate to a permanent state of love. Using character analysis and the enneagram as diagnostic tools, one can learn how to reabsorb I-dentities into the Essence. This process of reabsorption is the therapy, leading to a state of emptiness where true essence resides."
