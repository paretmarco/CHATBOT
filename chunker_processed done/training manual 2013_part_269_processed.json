  "title": "\"The Power of Gaze and Thought Concentration in Hypnotism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final passage, the author continues to explore the power of concentration and thought. They describe how focusing your thoughts and using the penetrating gaze can enable you to influence others and impose your will upon them. The passage goes on to detail specific experiments you can try, including persuading someone to part with an object or perform a service. By controlling your gaze and concentrating your thoughts, you can begin to hypnotize and subjugate others to your will. The author does caution that this kind of power must be wielded responsibly, as it can greatly diminish the strength of someone's judgment and will.",
  "content": "You will focus your thoughts on the idea that he must deliver this object, without having him to suspect what action you want to exercise. You will place yourself in front of him talking about the satisfaction you would feel if you had the object even only for a few minutes, you stare to the subject of the experiment with sweetness and persistence, like to let his brain absorb the idea of handing over the object. If the penetration of the gaze is sufficiently developed, and if thought concentration is quite large, you will quickly notice that every word has, on the subject, a physical effect that goes straight to the point you want to reach. The interlocutor, who does not take long to be more or less completely subjugated, abdicates the throne and ends up giving the object that you want. Here there is evidently a beginning of hypnotizing. Until you hold someone under your eyes, you greatly diminish more and more the strength of his judgment and his will.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember to use the power of your gaze and speech wisely when communicating with others. By focusing your thoughts and gaze on your desired outcome, you can influence those around you without them even realizing it. However, it is important to be mindful of not allowing someone else to subjugate you with their gaze. Use the technique mentioned in the text to maintain control of the conversation."
