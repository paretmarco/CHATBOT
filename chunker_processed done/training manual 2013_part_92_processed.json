  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the importance of the solar plexus as the source of energy for the brain, and how preparation and concentration on the plexus can sustain and nourish the brain for intense intellectual activity. Now we dive into the world of meditation, where the brain gives way to the solar plexus in a state of deep contemplation, leading us to touch the heart of the universe. Additionally, we'll learn about magnetizing and de-magnetizing passes, and how they can activate our inner resources in a nonverbal way. Here are some secrets for mastering these passes.",
  "content": "This is an activity of the brain. But when your meditation takes you onto a higher plane, you feel that your brain ceases to be actively in charge and the solar plexus takes over. You no longer grasp things analytically, with the intellect; instead you have a synthetic grasp of reality and you begin to vibrate in harmony with the subject of your meditation, to enjoy a marvellous sense of fulfilment: your meditation becomes contemplation. Your thought, your mental activity, has become contemplation of things so shining and wondrous that your vibrations become more and more intense. Without realizing just how it can be so, you know with absolute certainty that you understand things far better than when you use your intellect. Yes, and this is simply because you have touched the heart of the universe. USE OF MAGNETIC PASSES Activation of our clientâ€™s inner resources in a non verbal way Some secrets for doing the passes A student is first of all supposed to grasp the spirit and intention of both Magnetising and De-Magnetising Passes.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, through the use of magnetic passes and the practice of meditation, one can tap into their inner resources and achieve a deeper understanding of the universe.
