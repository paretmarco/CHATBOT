  "title": "The Challenges of Defining \"Human Magnetism\" and \"Hypnosis\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the mysterious and controversial fields of hypnosis and animal magnetism. Despite evidence of healing, mainstream science is still unable to explain these phenomena. The text features various theories surrounding hypnosis and animal magnetism, from physiological to sociological, but none have gained widespread acceptance. Within this context, the text discusses the healings of Italian magnetizers Andalini and Campanelli, who worked with thousands of people using techniques comparable to those of Dupotet. Although hundreds of physicians observed their practice, no universal theory has been found. Ultimately, the only measurable outcome of this field is the healings that have been achieved.",
  "content": "We read: “When two hypnotherapists are together, you will most likely have two different opinions on hypnosis and trance phenomenon.”97 In recent years we have seen in Italy the discussions on the healings of magnetizers such as Andalini (1960) and Campanelli (2000). These persons worked with thousands of people (Andalini with about 10.000 people at a rate of 400 each year) with techniques similar to that of Dupotet. They met hundreds of physicians but no universal theory has yet been found. The only measurable thing in this field are the healings. The same doubts that still exist today were obviously present in the 1800s among magnetizers. In the first place, there was lack of agreement among magnetizers with regard to what may be called the fundamental principle of magnetic healing; for many magnetizers still thought that the crisis was the great curative agent, and that to abolish entirely the baquet, the chain, and the ‘touching’ which brought that crisis on was an immense mistake.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while there may be differing opinions among hypnotherapists and magnetizers, the effectiveness of their techniques cannot be denied based on the healings they have achieved. It is important to keep an open mind and continue to explore and research these fields in order to better understand and utilize their potential benefits for those in need."
