  "title": "What is the process for magnetizing a subject according to \"L'Art de Magnetiser\" fifth edition?",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes the methodology of magnetism as described in \"L'Art de Magnetiser.\" It explains the importance of concentration and silence during the process, and the physical contact necessary between the magnetiser and the magnetised subject. After touching thumbs, the magnetiser stares into the subject's eyes until they close, and then moves their hands over the subject's body for several minutes. This concludes the main process, which is important for inducing the desired state in the subject.",
  "content": "The magnetiser should then fix his eyes on those of his subject, who, on his part, should do all he can to look at his. He should do it for some time. It is probable that during this time the pupils of the subject's eyes will contract and dilate inordinately, and his eyelids fall, not to rise again, not- withstanding his efforts. \"After the shutting of the eyes the magnetiser should continue to hold the subject's thumbs until the eyes cease to roll under the eyelids, and deglutition no longer takes place; then he can let go the thumbs, and, drawing back a little and closing his hands, he should raise them on each side of the subject until they are over the subject's head, and, opening them, he should hold them there for ten or fifteen seconds: then he should bring them down slowly past the subject's ears and along his arms to the ends of the fingers. He should make eight or ten of these passes, each of which should take nearly a minute.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism or mesmerism is an ancient healing technique that involves the transfer of energy from the magnetizer to the subject. To achieve a mesmerized state, the magnetizer should maintain eye contact with the subject, hold their thumbs until their eyes cease to roll under the eyelids, and make eight or ten passes over the subject's body without touching them. These passes should be made gently and at a few inches distance to prevent any adverse reactions. With practice and patience, magnetism can be a beneficial therapy for pain management and overall well-being."
