  "title": "Developing sensitivity with DeLausanne's method.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed De Lausanne's method and the three phenomena that can be experienced while using it. Now, the author explains how these sensations can be used to diagnose the patient's disease. The relevant names mentioned are De Lausanne and somnambulists. The text also emphasizes that anyone can awaken their natural body capability to perceive these sensations.",
  "content": "While drawing your hands slowly before your patient at the distance of three or four inches, and holding your fingers slightly bent, you will feel, either at the ends of the fingers, or at the palm of the hand, different sensations as they pass along before the affected organ of the patient. These sensations will be either of cold, or of prickly heat, or of slight pain, or of numbness. They will indicate to you the principal seat of the disease, and consequently the part upon which you ought to direct the action. 2. You may experience a feeling of pain or a difficulty in the internal organs of your body, corresponding with those which are affected in your patient. This is a sympathetic action noticed in many somnambulists. It is evident that this sensation intimates to us the seat and the nature of the disease. I will add one thing, the reason of which I will soon explain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing these techniques of hand-drawing and paying attention to the sensations that arise can help identify the principal seat and nature of the disease in your patient. Additionally, being aware of the sympathetic actions noticed in somnambulists and the vapor that escapes from certain parts of the patient's body and takes a certain direction can further guide your actions during treatment. Remember to trust your senses and abandon yourself entirely to their action."
