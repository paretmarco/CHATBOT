The author emphasizes the need for humane and ethical treatment and highlights the fascination and mystery that surrounds mesmeric performances.",
  "content": "If the case is taken, under medical supervision,” the duty of the mesmerist is to work steadily for the ultimate cure of the disease, leaving the medical and hygienic advice entirely in the hands of the medical practitioner. If you have any suggestion to make, any suspicions, doubts, communicate them to the doctor in charge—in fact, consult with him, and leave all the directions entirely in his hands. You will always find this course advisable. The medical adviser is pleased, being duly honoured, and the patient or friends are not, perplexed by divided authority, and you will have free course to do the work to your satisfaction. The medical man who consents to a mesmerist being called in to a case will, as a rule, be happy, to second any reasonable proposition which the mesmerist may make. CHARTER VII HOW TO GIVE AN ENTERTAINMENT. Mesmerism, as an entertainment, either in drawing-room, or more publicly in platform exhibitions, is always fascinating. There is an air of the wonderful and mysterious about mesmeric entertainments which is always sure to draw the public. Where such exhibitions are judiciously and humanely given, the public will always be much interested.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, when it comes to mesmerism, it is important to remember that if it is being used for medical purposes, the mesmerist should always consult with a medical practitioner and leave all medical advice and directions in their hands. However, as an entertainment, mesmerism can be fascinating and useful in creating trust in the practitioner. When people witness the results firsthand, their attitudes toward the techniques can change."
