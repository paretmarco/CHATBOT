  "title": "\"Exploring Psychometry: Unveiling the Untold Traits and Abilities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the differences between approaching a mathematical problem with algebra and intuition. Now, she delves into the realm of psychometry, which is essentially a more spiritual and exalted version of intuition. Through psychometry, hidden traits of character can be uncovered, and forgotten family history can be brought to light through old objects. The author even cites an example of a woman, Mrs. Wm. Denton, who discovered valuable copper and gold mines by means of her psychometric gift. While the author is not entirely convinced of psychometry's claims, she believes that its cultivation can prove to be a source of amusement and instruction. Continuing on the same thread, she provides a mode for cultivating psychometry - by placing the subject in the mesmeric deep.",
  "content": "The circumstances and relations of the forgotten in family history, at a stated period, can be brought to light by the influence still left on some old relic, trophy, gem, or piece of tapestry. There are authenticated instances of valuable mines having been discovered by it. It is a well-known historical fast fact that Mrs. Wm. Denton (wife of Professor Denton, the celebrated geologist), discovered copper mines in Canada as well as gold mines in Australia, by means of her psychometrical gift. This lady was also a great help to her husband in his scientific investigations. In some instances it has been employed in tracing crime, and in finding stolen and lost articles. While not prepared to advance so much in the favour of Psychometry as claimed for it by various authorities, I am inclined to give it a place here, as its cultivation in my opinion can do no harm, and may be a source of innocent amusement and instruction to many. To cultivate it the following modes may be adopted. Place your subject in the mesmeric deep, sufficiently deep to be entirely lost to the consciousness of external things.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, psychometry may not have scientific backing, but it could be a harmless means of entertainment and education. To cultivate this ability, one may begin by placing a trusted person's item in the possession of a deeply entranced subject who can describe their feelings and sensations without suggestion. With time and practice, the sensitive's ability to diagnose the item's owner's appearance, history, and character will grow. Who knows, this practice may even lead to discovering lost articles or even valuable mines."
