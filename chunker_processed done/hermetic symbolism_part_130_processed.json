  "title": "\"The Alchemical Process: From Material Selection to Initiation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains the alchemical process, and how the starting point is discovering and choosing the appropriate subject. The material is common, but recognition is key. The Masonic candidate must undergo various tests, including cleaning metals to remove any foreign bodies. The chosen subject is then reduced to itself, stripped of all artificialities, and closed inside the Chamber of Reflection. Here, symbolic death takes place, and the birth of the new initiate - represented by the color black - occurs. In this context, the author poses the question: why are there two containers, one holding Salt and one holding Sulphur, in the Chamber of Reflection?",
  "content": "Alchemy recommends that once a favourable material has been chosen, minutely examined and recognised, all surfaces must be cleaned, to remove any foreign bodies that may have accidently become stuck to the outside. In short: the material must be reduced to itself and nothing else. And similarly the recipient must be stripped of all his artificialities: he too must be strictly reduced to himself and nothing more. The cabinet of reflection In this state of primitive innocence, of rediscovered philosophical candour, the subject is closed inside a small space, where no outside light can penetrate. This is the Chamber of Reflection, corresponding to the alchemist’s cupboard, the hermetically sealed Philosophers’ Egg. The layman finds there the shadowy tomb where he must, voluntarily, put his prior existence to death. By decomposing the external layers that impede the free expansion of the seed of individuality, this symbolic death is a prelude to the birth of the new self, who will be the Initiate – born out of putrefaction and represented by the alchemists with the colour black. The Masonic ritual states that among the various objects inside the chamber of reflection there should be two containers, one holding Salt and the other Sulphur. Why?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Chamber of Reflection symbolizes the philosophical journey of self-discovery and transformation. To achieve this transformation, both the chosen material and the recipient must be stripped down to their essential selves. The use of Salt and Sulphur in the Chamber represents the balance of two opposing forces and the stability needed for personal growth. By embracing this process, one can emerge as an Initiate, born out of putrefaction, and ready to embark on a new path of enlightenment."
