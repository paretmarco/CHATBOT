  "title": "\"The Power of Mesmerism and Hypnotism\"",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text describes the use of mesmerism in influencing the patient's mind, particularly in treating addiction. The mesmerizer can bargain with the patient to awaken at a specific time or use suggestions to create an aversion to alcohol. However, there are rare cases where the sleep is prolonged, which can cause distress to the patient. In these instances, the mesmerizer must maintain their composure. Additionally, patients should only be touched by their mesmerizer unless given consent, as it can lead to Cross-Mesmerism. The following 200 tokens delve deeper into the different types of patients and their responses to mesmerism.",
  "content": "ABOVE ALL THINGS, THE MESMERISER SHOULD PRESERVE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND, and he may be assured that the longest sleep will end spontaneously. “It may as well be observed in this place that the patient should not be touched by anyone but his mesmeriser unless he wishes it or at least gives his consent. He can perhaps, bear the touch of certain individuals, and may express a repugnance to be touched by others, and this quite irrespective of attachment or repulsion with regard to those individuals in his normal state. With most sensitives it is quite immaterial who or how many people touch them, but there are occasionally cases when, by so touching them, a very distressing state, called Cross-Mesmerism, is produced, and the more particularly in the cases of patients who are naturally highly nervous and, perhaps hysterical. It is in these cases, of Cross-Mesmerism that we most often find a difficulty in determining the sleep.” The foregoing is a pretty full extract. I give it because it presents, in the simplest form, the procedure of the best class of mesmerists. The entire absence of technicalities and pedantic language has also much to recommend it to my readers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, a successful mesmerist must maintain a calm and focused presence of mind and avoid touching the patient unless necessary. Different patients and different stages of sleep may produce varying results, but with perseverance and dedication, a skilled mesmerist can achieve the desired outcome. Remember, there are different degrees of sleep and hypnotic states, but with proper understanding and practice, one can master the art of hypnotism."
