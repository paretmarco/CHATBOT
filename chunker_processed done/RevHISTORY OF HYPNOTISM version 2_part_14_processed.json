  "title": "\"The Mysterious Power of Animal Magnetism in Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we learned that studies have shown how healers' moods can affect their work, and that the positive energy of psychotherapists can influence patients' healing process. In this concluding part, we explore a biochemist's experience with Oskar Estebany, a healer who increased the activity of enzymes in a solution simply by holding its container. Animal Magnetism, a technique that pertains not just to humans but to every living being, shows that animals can perceive energy immediately and have more sensorial acuity than humans. Science cannot fully explain its mysterious power.",
  "content": "Appelbaum says that other studies have shown that patients whose psychotherapists are \"empathetic, therapeutically genuine, and...view patients positively,\" do better than patients whose therapists do not have these qualities.3 In Italy there have been researches in many hospitals showing positive results.4 These results were published on medical reviews. Finally, even if a part of animal magnetism, such as the power of passes or the power of finding healing remedies could also receive current physiological explanations, these nevertheless do not reduce their efficacy and the need to learn these techniques. Why the name Animal Magnetism? The name ‘animal magnetism’ appears therefore most appropriate as we are touching something pertaining not just to the human being , but to every living being. It is a very simple and at the same time very powerful and mysterious technique. But science even today is not able to fully explain many elements of the animal world. Animals perceive energy immediately, and they have more sensorial acuity than human beings. We have found that we can successfully train people to recover these abilities.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, animal magnetism is a powerful and mysterious technique that has been shown to have positive effects on patients when practiced by empathetic and genuine therapists. While not fully understood by science, healers all over the world continue to use this natural ability to promote healing and wellness in both humans and animals. With proper training and attention, anyone can learn to tap into their innate sensory perceptions and intuition, and become a part of this fascinating world of magnetism and energy."
