  "title": "\"The Physiology Behind Hypnotism: Exploring Different Theories\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the various physical effects of hypnosis on the body, including changes in the pupil and eyeballs. Heidenhain, a renowned physiologist, was intrigued by the reflex mechanisms of hypnotism and whether they could explain the state of trance. However, his initial theory fell apart upon close examination. Heidenhain's interest in the subject led him to explore a new theory based on inhibitory action in the nervous system, which he believed provided a more plausible explanation.",
  "content": "This view, however, had to be abandoned, as the faces of hypnotised persons are usually red, and not pale, as they would be were the asterioles contracted. Further, Heidenhain performed a crucial experiment by giving to his brother nitrite of amyl, which causes dilatations of the vessels by vaso-motor paralysis, when he still found hypnotism could be readily induced, showing that the state was not caused by deficient blood supply. Editor's note: Even here we have a type of hypnotism that is different from what is normally called “modern hypnosis.” Heidenhain has advanced another mid more probable hypothesis. During the past twenty years a new mode of nervous action, known as Inhibitory action has been discovered by physiologists. A good example is supplied by the innervation of the heart. This organ has nervous ganglia in its substance by which its rhythmic contractions are maintained. Further it is supplied by the vagus or pneumogastric nerve and by the sympathetic.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Heidenhain's experiments suggest that hypnotism is not caused by deficient blood supply, but rather by inhibitory action in the nervous system. By understanding this mode of nervous action, we can gain a deeper insight into the workings of the human brain and its relation to hypnotic states."
