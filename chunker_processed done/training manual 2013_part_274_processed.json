  "first_phrase": "This section discusses two exercises aimed at achieving greater consciousness and separating perception from emotion. It follows a quote about the Id's journey towards self-awareness. These exercises involve paying attention mentally to different parts of the body and maintaining awareness of the body while in motion. Practicing these exercises could lead to a sense of rebalancing and realignment in addition to feeling more energized.",
  "content": "The properly performed concentration, will give a sensation that the student will easily be able to recognize; sometimes is a stinging, other times a light impact or the impression that blood is heading to the designated point. You can also put a finger on any point, and insistently focus the thought on the touched point. Exercise 62 Is the same action of attention, but in motion. As you walk, talk, keep a fixed reference point in yourself. Better a peripheral point. Take consciousness for example of your hand, your foot. This exercise will help to separate gradually the perception of the body from your emotional and to acquire greater consciousness. Experimentally we observe that, constantly operating and maintaining awareness of the body, first it take place a rebalancing and realignment due to the abandonment of unnecessary tensions; and is a feeling of energy too. After a little, we pass to a further stadium.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporate the rule of \"three times ten minutes\" into your daily routine to gradually increase body consciousness and awareness. Experimentally observed, this exercise can lead to the abandonment of unnecessary tensions, a rebalancing of energy, and a deeper perception of the body. Other exercises can be tried, starting with short durations for unexercised individuals."
