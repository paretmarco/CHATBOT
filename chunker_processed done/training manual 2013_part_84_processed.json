  "title": "\"Activating Your Solar Plexus: The Second Enteric Brain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the importance of the solar plexus in experiencing and understanding the universe beyond just studying it intellectually. Emotions are felt in the solar plexus, the second enteric brain, and can be influenced by our thoughts and approach to the world. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the connection between our thoughts and emotions and how they can impact our physical and mental state. The text also mentions that awakening the solar plexus is the foundation for awakening a second center at the heart, according to ancient internal alchemical teaching.",
  "content": "When your solar plexus â€“ begins to feel and and vibrate with great intensity, then, yes! You can then touch and move the heart of the universe. In ancient internal alchemical teaching, awakening the solar plexus is the basis to awakening also a second center at the hearth.20 Where do you feel your emotions? When you feel an emotion, terror, anguish or love, you don't feel it in your brain or even in your physical heart; you feel it in your solar plexus. But emotions are not only created by external simple events; they are also created by our thoughts that define the way in which we approach the world. The more we will approach it in a defensive way, the more we will change our natural balanced state of mind toward an unbalanced one. As we think that we are in danger, our senses sharpen in different way. This will will create unbalance in our body and our second brain will send messages for activating the upper mind to work on solving them.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve balance, it's important to acknowledge that our emotions are not just products of external events but also of our thoughts, which can lead to an unbalanced state of mind. Recognizing where we feel our emotions, particularly in the solar plexus, can help us activate our center and bring our body back into equilibrium. In magnetism, using passes directed toward the enteric brain, touching the solar plexus and in sequence the hara, can help stop the vicious circle of overthinking and overworking, ultimately leading to a sense of balance and centeredness."
