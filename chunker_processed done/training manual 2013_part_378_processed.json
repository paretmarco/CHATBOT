  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, the author delves into the concept of \"magnetic ecstasy\" and its connection to the alchemical symbol of the magnet. The text references the works of Kremmerz and Pernety in explaining how the utilization of sexual strength is key to enhancing oneself and how the hidden salt within the center of the magnet can turn philosophical gold to ash. The text also links the caduceus symbol to the magnet and traces the concept of circulatory authority possessed by quicksilver back to the utilization of breathing. The author provides an exercise, among others in the book Magnetism and Energetic Ascent, to assist readers in unlocking these aspects of their being.",
  "content": "WORKING ON THE BASIC ENERGY AND ON THE SECRET FIRE The magnet As stressed by Kremmerz, “the alchemical sign of the magnet is analogous to the sympathetic attraction which is established between sexual extremes”. The meaning of what Pernety says is thus clear: “The centre of the magnet contains a hidden salt, a menstrual cycle which has the capacity to ash the philosophical gold.” Basically, the utilization of sexual strength is one of the keys to enhance man.119 The hidden salt which can make gold ashen is this strength. This strength further lies at the source of igneous quicksilver (that is, the quicksilver of the Wiseman), i.e. of central pillar the cauceus. The magnet is the active and passive pairing of the human body. The sign of the caduceus is thus connected to the magnet once more. This “circulatory authority possessed by quicksilver” traces itself back to the utilization of breathing. The following exercise, along with other described in the book Magnetism and Energetic Ascent will help you.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical significance of the magnet lies in its ability to harness the power of sexual energy and the hidden salt within it, which can turn philosophical gold into ash. The magnet is also connected to the igneous quicksilver and central pillar of the cauceus, which is linked to the circulatory authority possessed by quicksilver. To enhance your own strength using the magnet's power, try the exercise mentioned above along with others in the book Magnetism and Energetic Ascent. Remember to take a deep breath and feel the energy around you while practicing."
