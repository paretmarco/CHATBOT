  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we discussed the power of breath and its connection to physical, mental, and spiritual health. Now, we'll delve into the specifics of how to breathe properly, including the importance of upper chest breathing and using breath and light together. We'll also explore how breathing exercises can develop personal magnetism and lead to spiritual inspiration. Discover the rewards of right breathing as we explore the final 200 tokens.",
  "content": "Inhale as long as you possibly can, but without effort, or any strain on any part of the body. When feeling any distress in the sides or the chest, itself, remember that it is the result of insufficient relaxation. Just correct the position of your chest and set the spinal column more erect, its weight resting on the end of the column, with knees a trifle bent. The importance of Upper Chest Breathing While many people do abdominal breathing, few breathe in the upper chest. The upper chest is also the seat of the heart. The key is inhaling fully filling firstly the upper part, and after completely the bottom part of the lungs. Pay specific attention to the upper part. There is a connection to the development of the force. Breath and Light Another basic key is using Breath and Light together. Breath can also appear as light (\"The life was the light of men\"; John 1:4).",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, practicing upper chest breathing and combining breath with light can improve not only our physical health but our connection to spirituality and the universe. Remember to inhale fully, fill the upper chest, and correct your position if feeling any discomfort. With this practice, we can align our breath with the force of consciousness, leading to a more fulfilling life."
