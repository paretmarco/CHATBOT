  "title": "Mesmerism and Medicine Among the Ancients",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text dives into the ancient practice of medicine in Greece. The first Greek physicians relied on certain magic processes which resembled modern-day mesmerism. Hippocrates himself advocated for the beneficial effects of hand manipulation in curing the body. The text also explores the idea that health could be implanted in the sick by certain gestures and contacts, and the existence of a cavern consecrated to Pluto and Juno where priests would sleep for the sake of patients. The author disagrees with M. Foissac, who believed that the demon of Socrates was a state of crisis or natural somnambulism.",
  "content": "It has often appeared, while I have thus been soothing my patients, as if there were a singular property, in my hands to pull and draw away from the affected parts aches and diverse impurities, by laying my hand upon the place, and by extending my fingers towards it. Thus it is known to some of the learned... that health may be implanted in the sick by certain gestures, and by contact as some diseases may be communicated from one to another.‚Äù According to Strabo, there was between Nepa and Fralea a cavern consecrated to Pluto and Juno, in which the priests slept for the sake of the patients who came to consult them. According to M. Foissac, the familiar spirit, the demon of Socrates, that interior voice which appraised him of that which was to happen, and of that which he should do, was nothing but a state of crisis or of natural somnambulism with which the godlike genius was frequently affected. In this I do not agree with M. Foissac. We have no record of Socrates having been in a somnambulistic condition, natural or artificial.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, throughout history, there have been various beliefs and practices related to healing and spiritual influence, including the use of gestures, contact, and even caves dedicated to deities. While some may disagree with certain interpretations or theories, it is clear that spiritual faith and natural power were highly regarded and utilized in ancient cultures such as the Persans. Understanding these beliefs and practices can offer valuable insights into the diverse approaches to healing and well-being that have been used throughout human history."
