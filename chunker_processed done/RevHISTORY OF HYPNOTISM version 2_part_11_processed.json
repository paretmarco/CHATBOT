  "title": "Animal Magnetism: A Participatory Healing Discipline",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus is on the positive effects of magnetism in curing illnesses that cannot be treated through conventional methods. It emphasizes the fact that despite being a popular and successful treatment, it still tends to invoke skepticism and strong reactions from people. The text mentions various people who have contributed significantly to the popularity of magnetism and helped others feel better. It relates animal magnetism to the current quantistic paradigm of quantum entanglement and highlights the fact that animals too can benefit from this technique. The text also mentions a friend of the author named Elizabeth, who has been successful in healing horses through magnetism.",
  "content": "All the people we will mention in this book have huge merits. Maybe these merits are not toward our modern reductionist Newtonian science, but they are towards humanity. They have helped other people to feel better, to live longer and better lives, and they have looked toward an upper dimension which modern man has a need to retrieve. It is important to give justice to them and to the wellbeing they brought about. Quantum entanglement Animal Magnetism is based on a positive intent toward another person. Magnetism is a participatory discipline, that could be explained by using the current quantistic paradigm of a quantistic ‘entanglement’ between operator and subject. At this point it is a fact that not only human beings, but even animals can be healed in a simple way. For example, a friend of ours, Elizabeth2, uses this technique for healing horses with astonishing results. Animals will feel better and recover from their illnesses.",
  "last_phrase": "The people mentioned in this book may not be recognized by modern science, but their contributions to humanity are worth acknowledging. Magnetism, an age-old healing technique, has shown promising results in healing animals and humans alike. While there may not be a physical correlate of this force, the results speak for themselves. Let us keep an open mind and heart to the possibilities of healing beyond our understanding."
