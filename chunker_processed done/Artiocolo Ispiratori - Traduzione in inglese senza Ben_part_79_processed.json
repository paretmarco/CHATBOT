  "title": "Understanding the «Pass» Technique for Curing Smoking Habit",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, you will discover the effectiveness of the \"pass\" technique in curing nicotine addiction. Herman Michel claims that up to 90% of his patients are cured of smoking with this method. The treatment only lasts a few moments, but the results are impressive. Some patients have to come back for annual de-conditioning, while others are conclusively healed. A third group resists for a while before suffering a relapse. Michel advises his patients to avoid cigarettes for at least ten days after the procedure.",
  "content": "In some instances, the «de-conditioning» is so thorough that, as with a lady from Rome, in order to take up smoking again such patients would be forced to come back to the Swiss man to remove from them the mysterious «inhibition to smoking» he has created. One minute might seem to be too short a time to be cured from the habit of cigarette smoking. — Is it over already? is the question posed by a rather incredulous lady — It is now your turn, madam. If you do not lend me assistance, if you do not make a slight deliberate effort, it would have all been in vain. Henceforth, and for a period of ten days, you will need to avoid even looking at cigarettes. You better start right from now. Throw into the dustbin the packet you are keeping inside your bag – is the answer given by Herman Michel with an understanding smile.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the method used by Herman Michel to help people quit smoking may seem mysterious, it appears to be effective for some individuals. Ultimately, the success of the treatment relies on the patient's willingness to avoid cigarettes, even after the short session. Taking small but deliberate steps, such as throwing away cigarettes, can aid in the journey to becoming smoke-free."
