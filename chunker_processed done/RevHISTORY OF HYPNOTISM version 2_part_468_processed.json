  "title": "Can Mesmerism cure diseases and induce unconsciousness for painless surgery in the 19th century?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, we witness an account of a Hindu religious ceremony called 'mundur' that aims to cure a woman of her illness. An onlooker, an author who is also a military personnel, attends the ceremony and witnesses the 'vergraggey' perform various religious rites and cures the woman of her illness. The author initially thinks of it as priestly deception but, later on, learns that the 'vergraggey' possesses special abilities to put people to sleep and speak through them. The text ends by referencing the achievements of Esdaile, who was a pioneer in the field of Mesmerism.",

To the astonishment of her family, and all present, she obeyed, walked direct to the hand-mill and began grinding corn for the evening meal-a work I am certain she had been incapable of performing for months. Looking upon this as mere priestly deceptions, I declined being present at any future visits. However, her mother, her brother, and several men of the detachment assured me afterwards that the man not only put her asleep whenever he came, but made her speak during that sleep, described her disease, and what would cure it. I laughed at the poor people as fools, and abused the man as a knave. But his mild, good-humoured rebuke is often now present to my mind. 'Youth, the hair on your chin is incomplete; by the time it is like mine you will think differently of me.' The woman recovered, and rapidly.\" With Esdaile, pure Mesmerism of the school of de Puysegur, as modified by Dupotet and Lafontaine, may be said to have reached a very high point.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism, also known as animal magnetism, was a controversial practice that gained popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries. Dr. Esdaile's works and Mr. Ward's operation are some of the remarkable instances of mesmeric sleep being used to perform operations on patients without pain. However, it was also criticized by many, and its scientific validity remains disputed. Despite this, the practice continued to evolve in countries like France, merging with other findings, indicating that the practice was influenced by cultural context and evolving scientific knowledge."
