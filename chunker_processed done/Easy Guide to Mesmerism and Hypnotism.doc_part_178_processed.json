By disease, or disease, we find a disturbance of the life forces, and want of harmony or ease throughout the whole organisation, corresponding to a want of equable temperature, such as a hot aching head with cold feet, a cold stomach, and correspondingly defective digestion, a heated front head with mental excitement, a heated back head with temper, or diseased amatory desires, etc.",
