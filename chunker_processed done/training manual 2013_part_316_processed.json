  "title": "\"The Power of Reintegration: Achieving Higher States of Presence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the concept of \"reintegration\" and its significance for achieving a higher state of consciousness and energetic superabundance in humans. Now, let's delve deeper into the idea of reintegration and its importance. The text explores the connection between reintegration and the power of magnetism, and how being in a state of real presence can lead to greater healing abilities, creativity, and awareness of objective reality. It also poses thought-provoking questions about our present state of being and urges readers to consider the potential benefits of reintegrating the total self. This section features prominent concepts such as magnetism, energetic ascent, quantum reality, consciousness, and the \"homo totus\".",
  "content": "It is however possible to push the elevation and reintegration of the “homo totus”, of the total man, even further, until both reach a sublime level wherein man might truly become aware of the objective (and quantic???) reality of the world as well. Genius, creativity, are also expressions of such a higher state. The result of reaching such higher stages of presence and “energetic superabundance” is also perceived when one is dealing with other people. Consciousness and Reintegration Why and what should one reintegrate? The basic key to the power of Magnetism and the Energetic Ascent of man is “reintegration”. Why reintegration? The answer thereto lies in another question: How far are we actually de-integrated? How many times are we unable to accomplish what we would like to do? How much are we truly present to ourselves in the course of a day? How many times do unwanted thoughts and ideas cross our mind? On how many occasions we are not really ourselves?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, reintegrating ourselves is essential for achieving a higher level of consciousness and energetic superabundance. By being fully present in the moment, we can exercise our freedom of choice and become aware of the objective reality of the world around us. With consciousness comes the power to shape our destiny, and hypnosis can offer techniques for achieving this objective state of being."
