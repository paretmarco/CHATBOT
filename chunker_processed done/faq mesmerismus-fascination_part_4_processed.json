  "title": "\"Look-Centered Therapy: A Fascinating Method to Eliminate Pain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author discusses the look-centred therapy method for treating patients with pain and personal problems. The technique involves fixing the patient's attention on other spaces to access their unconscious and guiding them to a state of fascination without using words. Once in a state of \"non-thinking,\" the patient's symptoms disappear, leading to a new life dimension. This approach is not mere hypnotic suggestion and may require multiple attempts before success. The most important aspect of the method is the observation of the patient and the therapist's mutual observation.",
  "content": "The unconscious, indeed, always works for the person’s wellbeing and in his interest. We are not dealing here with some mere hypnotic suggestion, so much so that on some occasions (albeit rarely) it is necessary to operate two or three times before “the right moment can be grabbed”. If it had been no more than a suggestion, the third attempt would be bound to emulate what happened to the previous ones. As that is not the case, however, it means we have actually guided our patient to a new life dimension. A key aspect of the look-centred therapy is letting ourselves be observed and observing in turn the patient while we give him a chance to recollect the state that caused him problems. Thereupon, we shall lead the person into a state of fascination without any recourse to words. Such method, indeed, allows us to transport him into a state of “non-thinking” where the symptom disappears. It is the equivalent of resetting the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by utilizing the look-centred therapy and the power of fascination, one can attain a state beyond the trance and reset their mind, leading to the disappearance of the symptom. Whether through therapy or in everyday life, we can use this knowledge to observe ourselves and achieve a state of non-thinking for our own wellbeing."
