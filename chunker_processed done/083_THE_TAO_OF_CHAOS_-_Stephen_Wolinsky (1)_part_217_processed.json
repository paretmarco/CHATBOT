  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus is on the personality type that tries to fill their internal emptiness with flattery and self-flattery as a way of compensating for their worthlessness and dependence. This personality is obsessed with reinforcing their pride to hide their neediness. They develop a false self-image of being greater than they are and fantasize achievements to defend against the emptiness. Such individuals can be overly generous and over-give to get flattered, leading to inflated stories and lies of success. Self-grandiosity must be explored to uncover their true desires and reintegrated into their Essence.",

DENt ing is acted out. See illustration #8. In an attempt to get flattered, this personality, like the co-dependent, over-gives in an attempt to get flattered as a giver. This leads to inflated stories to others and self-lies of success as a way to get flattered. Simply stated, flattery is used to fill the emptiness. This observer/personality dyad fixation compensates with a false strong will at the level of the observer/personality dyad in an attempt to hide the dependency. Frequently the I-dentities are seeking the essential quality of will, power, or freedom. Self-Therapy Here again, the I-dentity of grandiosity must be explored. This self-grandiosity covers the deep worthlessness and de- pendence. As with all places where the observer fixates attention, the I-dentities must be named and their true desire uncovered before they can be reabsorbed into Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome the fixation on flattery and false grandiosity, it’s important to explore underlying I-dentities and their true desires. By understanding and reabsorbing these parts into one's essence, individuals can move away from compensating identities and towards true independence, worthiness, and freedom. Self-therapy can help identify and address these underlying issues."
