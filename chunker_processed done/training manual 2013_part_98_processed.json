  "title": "\"The Power of Passes for Healing and Focusing Will\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we discovered the power of passes and how they can connect with our primal brain and activate our second brain. As we delve further into animal magnetism, we learn that passes are not only physical gestures but also symbols that concentrate our will and energy. It is important to be aware of the client and their reactions, as we enter a trance-like state where healing is possible. In this last section, we explore how animal magnetism and prana are intertwined and how our bodies can interact with this force. We also learn how to direct this energy through our will and how charged postures can help us in this process.",
  "content": "Passes concentrate our WILL Passes are also SYMBOLS. Every time we do them we concentrate our energy on them, and in a certain ways they become “charged postures”. In this way they are able to direct something that it is similar to a subtle energy. In order to understand and practice effectively animal magnetism we must enter in its reality. Indians talk of “prana” as a form of energy which is present everywhere. Magnetism is very similar to the idea of “prana”. As we enter in this frame of mind, we understand why we say that the Magnetic emanation has a tendency to ascend23. Therefore, in bringing your hands from above downwards, you pull the emanation downwards, while your Will calls it from its laboratory, and concentrates it in your hands, from which it flows to any point your Will directs2. Your body can interact with this force.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the art of passes and hand magnetism can help us direct a subtle form of energy, similar to the concept of prana, to benefit ourselves and others. By understanding the positive and negative effects of our hand movements, we can use these techniques effectively in therapy and healing practices. Practice and patience are key to unlocking the full potential of this powerful tool."
