  "title": "\"Instant Fascination: A Technique to Eradicate Physical Pains\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text examines the revolutionary technique of instant fascination, which can alleviate physical pains and provide lasting results. It traces its roots to Erminio from Pisa, the only practitioner in Italy. The technique involves fixing the patient's intense gaze beyond their problems and invoking the unconscious to cure physical ailment. A simple knock over the shoulder is used to wake them up, and the results are often surprising. A technical explanation suggests that this method works by shifting the patient's attention away from their fixed realities.",
  "content": "At our institute, we keep a number of videos which corroborate what we have stated in this connection. The methodology is rather easy. After we have caused the patient to indicate to you where he is experiencing pain, we fix him intensely so as to fascinate him, for the explicit purpose of taking him “beyond the point”, that is, beyond rigid positions and mental habits which represent the sum-total of his personal problems. At some stage, one feels intuitively that the patient’s pain has vanished. He is then woken up by a simple rapid knock of the hand over his shoulder. The most positive aspect of it all is that the person is feeling better! That seems impossible to the person who is merely watching. From a technical point of view, it is on the contrary very natural. The pains and the other problems we have referred to represent “fixed realities”. The moment we look at the subject, we settle his attention upon some other space. We would say that we are now in direct contact with the unconscious, if we wished to borrow Erickson’s terminology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the look-centred therapy methodology focuses on guiding the patient beyond fixed realities and mental habits towards a new life dimension. By facilitating direct contact with the unconscious, we can observe and help the patient, leading to positive results like pain relief. The approach requires intense fixation and patience, and it has been proven effective in several cases. The institute has several videos to corroborate these claims."
