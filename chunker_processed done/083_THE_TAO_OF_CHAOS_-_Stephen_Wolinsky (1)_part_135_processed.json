  "title": "\"Contemplating Transience and Time in Chaotic Chaos\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking piece, the author invites contemplation on the transience of everything in the universe and the fleeting nature of the perceiver. The last 200 tokens delve into the connection between time and human experience. By altering the time component, experiences cannot exist as they were, for they require a specific amount of time, space, mass, and energy. The author uses the example of anger, which must have a certain amount of each ingredient, and slows it down to illustrate how time affects it. This fascinating concept reveals that the rigidity of time, space, thought, and energy are essential to every experience's existence.",
  "content": "Here you are adding a bifurcation point (intensity) to an existing system. By changing the time component, the experience cannot exist. Why? Because all experiences have a specific amount of time and have a specific amount of mass, a specific amount of space, and a specific amount of energy. Once any aspect of that combination is altered it alters the ingredients of the experience. Thus the experience cannot remain the same or exist as it was. Let's say it this way; there is a rigidity that time, space, the thought and the energy of the thought called \"I feel bad\" all have to have in order for that thought to exist. Otherwise, it can no longer be there. Think in terms of a chocolate cake; it needs a certain amount of flour, water, salt, sugar, etc; to be a chocolate cake. In the same way, experiences like anger must have a certain amount of energy, space, mass, and time. If, for example, the anger moved very slowly you might feel it even more.'",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, altering any aspect of the combination of time, space, energy, and mass in an experience changes its essence, making it impossible to exist or remain the same. By slowing down our thoughts, we can experience a more intense presence of emotions like anger, while rapid thoughts might only give us a brief rush. Try the Tao of Chaos exercise #28 to explore these principles further."
