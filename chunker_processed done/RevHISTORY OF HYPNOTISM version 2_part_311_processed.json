  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author describes their experiences with Magnetic Magic and the effects it has on spectators. They explain how they prepare Magical circles and observe from a distance as the charm attracts certain individuals. The last 200 tokens focus on the author's cautionary advice, urging readers to be attentive when using this powerful force. They warn that the force may have affinity with other more subtle agents and that individuals who become magnetized may experience a disconnect from their senses, relying on intuition and vision instead.",
  "content": "Their features become changed, there is in their looks something uneasy, their body is tormented, they soon cease to be distracted, and appear to consider only one thing, the Magical sign: at the end of some minutes (three or four on the average), they push themselves strongly forward, a Magnet attracts them, they finally arise and turn around the mirror, stopping beside it, bending down nearly to the ground. . . . Therefore be attentive; you do not know the force (agent) you use; it appears to have affinity with other forces (agents) more subtle than itself, and endowed with higher virtues. Even, as in dreams, our eyes are of no service, so it is in these Magical enchantments, the eyes are useless, nevertheless there is vision. The Magnetised do not perceive (by reason) they have intuitions, a knowledge of that which isâ€”during such moments it is as though the soul, the life, had abandoned the body, the senses no more perform their functions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of enchantments to see clearly is an acknowledgment of the limitations of our will. The force or agents we use have a subtle affinity with higher virtues, and their power is within us. Even in moments when our senses fail, there is vision, and intuition guides us. Let us be attentive and acknowledge the power within ourselves to draw out our will and see clearly."
