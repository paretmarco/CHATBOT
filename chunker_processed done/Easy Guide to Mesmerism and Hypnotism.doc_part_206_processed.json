  "title": "Victory of Mesmerism: Experiments, Results and Perception",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes further experiments carried out by the author of the previous experiments to convince a skeptical committee that he had control over his sensitive. In the first part of the text, the author explains how the committee was satisfied with the previous experiments and wanted him to produce two more results, which he did. In the last 200 tokens, the author recounts how he was able to cause his sensitive to take a specific position through mental effort and mesmeric passes, and how he induced a cataleptic fit in the sensitive that was convincingly similar to a medical condition. Though unsettling, the spectacle ultimately proved the success of the author's experiments in mesmerism.",
  "content": "The next experiment was to produce a cataleptic fit, which could not be distinguished in any of its pathological features from a case such as a medical man would meet in the ordinary course of practice. This was done by irregular phreno-manipulation and suggestion. The spectacle produced by the subject is not likely to be soon forgotten by either the committee or the audience. The man suddenly fell upon the platform with the despairing shout peculiar to that disease. The veins of the neck and head became engorged, the lips from a healthy red became a deep blue-black. The spasmodic struggles of the body and the irregular action of the heart confirmed the processes of the disease. I watched the case narrowly, so as not to prolong the condition, and be ready to entirely de-mesmerise the sensitive and relieve him of all unpleasant results. (*) The committee were more than satisfied. Mesmerism came triumphant out of the ordeal; and what at first appeared a defeat, a hopeless disaster, was changed into a victory.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while the use and abuses of mesmerism are often exaggerated, it is important to recognize that its potential benefits lie in its ability to cure cataleptic fits and other conditions. However, it should only be used legitimately and responsibly by medical professionals, and not in public entertainment that could potentially cause harm to the subjects. It is encouraging to see more awareness and caution surrounding mesmerism, as demonstrated by Professor M'Kendrick's lecture in Glasgow."
