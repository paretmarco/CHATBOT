Mesmer's theory is based on the concept of something through which everything in the universe is interconnected. It is something before matter. Lacking other terms, he called it a universal fluid31. He used this word since he intuitively perceived the connection with other people and that in some way everything is interconnected. “All beings of the universe are so connected that it is as if they touched each other.” Mesmer32 One of the most intuitive ways of expressing it is through the concept of a fluid, of which we find similar examples in many cultures. This fluid is the basis of matter, and everything is bathed in the fluid, in a way that makes nothing local. \"The Coincidences\" of human beings and in the world \"testify of a general influence\" that work on some \"medium\" or some \"fluid\" that in some way constitutes and form the mass of the world\" Mesmer33 The fluid cannot be touched or seen directly as it is more subtle than the senses. The senses can perceive only some specificity of it.",
