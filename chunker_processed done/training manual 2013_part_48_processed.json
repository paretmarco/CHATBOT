  "title": "\"Emotional Release Techniques in Buddhism and Quantum Change\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses two methods for emotional release in Buddhism: the realization of \"samsaric consciousness\" and anatta, or no-soul. The last 200 tokens explain two exercises. The first method involves getting the subject to identify their emotion, releasing it through body movement, and then experiencing a state of calmness. The second method encourages the subject to enter into their emotional issue and locate it in their body before using a combination of magnetic passes and visualization to release negative energy.",
