  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explored the symbolism of Half Moon, Aries, and the Triangle in practical alchemy. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the author delves deeper into the concept of Philosophers' Mercury and how it represents the life force and unifying element in all beings. They also touch upon the Caduceus of Mercury and its depiction in ancient Roman art. Furthermore, the author explains the hermetic elements of fire, water, air, and earth, and how they are modalities of a single substance. The opposing pairs of these elements determine the characteristics of all created matter, and the balance between them helps to understand the essence of nature itself.",
  "content": "Other images depicting the hermetic caducy The Triangle In the order of closed shapes the triangle is found between the Circle and the square . It can therefore be deduced that it represents an intermediary entity between the almost abstract substance that can be called the spirit, , and the material sphere that is perceptible to our senses . In practical alchemy the Triangle is the symbol of the occult elements, which are: fire , water , air and earth . These are not simple elemental bodies, but rather modalities of the single substance which determine the corporeal characteristics of all that is created from it. The hermetic elements are easily intelligible abstractions, wholly removed from our physical perceptions. They must not be confused with the elemental things; those are simply the effects of which these elements are the cause. On the other hand, all matter is nothing more than the result of an equilibrium attained between the elements, which are arranged in opposing pairs, as shown by the following diagram: It is important to understand here that Air , being light and subtle, has a lightening effect that counterbalances the effect of Earth , thick and heavy, which condenses and gives weight.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the symbols and elements in alchemy can lead to a better comprehension of the relationship between the spiritual and material worlds. By recognizing the role of each element and how they interact with one another, we gain a deeper understanding of the natural order of the universe and the importance of balance in all things."
