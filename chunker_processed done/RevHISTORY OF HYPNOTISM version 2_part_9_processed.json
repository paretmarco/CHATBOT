  "content": "There are many other magnetists who are not known to the general public but did well to thousands of people. Our goal is to not only help people rediscover this healing methodology, but also to rediscover it at its higher level. In the course of the centuries it split into many branches, each one developing a specific aspect. We must again bring together what is dispersed in order to unleash its true power. Our modern world tends to divide. Even if dividing could sometimes be initially good, it risks making us forget that man is one. The fact is that this is not a discipline as the other ones are, which are based on fixed procedures. It is instead something that has its basis in the operator and his abilities. The good thing is that it can be learnt. The discipline requires as a basis a specific disposition of the operator: his sincere willingness and intent to help the other person. Science and magnetism Animal magnetism, even though its results are documented, cannot easily fit into the current reductionist approach of science, which always attempts to remove the influence of the operator from the experiment1. In reality animal magnetism is precisely based on creating this influence and this impact.",
