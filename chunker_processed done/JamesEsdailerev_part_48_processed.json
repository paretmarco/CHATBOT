  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, Puysegur successfully treated a patient using magnetic sleep therapy. In the last 200 tokens, we learn more about Puysegur's discovery of somnambulism and the ways in which he applied it. He found that individuals in magnetic sleep were in harmony with nature and could react at a distance. Despite an initial lack of success with one patient, Puysegur persevered with his methods and saw positive results. His insights into somnambulism would later be used in the development of hypnosis.",
  "content": "Today (Saturday) the shivering lasted less time than usual, his appetite was kept up, he enjoyed a good night's rest; lastly, I had the satisfaction of seeing him perceptibly better, and I expect that in the next three days he will resume his usual employments, etc.\" 13 Puysegur was discovering somnambulism. Mesmer already knew about it, but rarely applied it. Dans l’état de sommeil l’homme sent ses rapports avec toute la Nature – in the state of (magnetic) sleep the human being is in contact with all of Nature14 He also discovered that people in somnambulism could react at a distance. \"According to my usual practice,\" says Puysegur, \"I was magnetizing ... and after a quarter of an hour's attention and concentration on my part, and perfect tranquility on his, he told me that he felt nothing. As he had no complaint, this appeared to me quite natural. I however again pressed him between both my hands, merely to try whether I would be more successful; but he felt no more this second time than he had the first.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's pioneering work on somnambulism and magnetic sleep revealed the human body's connection with nature and its ability to react at a distance. His experiments also showed that a person's sensitivity to touch and pressure could vary at different distances. These discoveries have had lasting implications in the fields of hypnosis and psychology, and continue to be studied and applied today."
