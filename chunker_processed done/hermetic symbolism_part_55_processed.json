  "title": "Symbolism of the Triangle in Hermetic Alchemy.",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains the symbolism behind the triangle in practical alchemy. The triangle serves as an intermediary entity between spirit and matter, and is the symbol for the occult elements of fire, water, air, and earth. The hermetic elements are abstractions removed from our physical perceptions and are not to be confused with elemental things. They determine the corporeal characteristics of everything. In this last part, the author delves deeper into the relationship between the elements, explaining how opposing pairs work in opposing each other's tendencies. The author uses symbolism to explain how water works against the upward force of fire, leading to a sense of repose and calm. The author also explains how air is like fire that has been halted and suffocated.",
  "content": "Water , cold and wet, on the other hand, has a palliative effect on dry, hot Fire . The symbol for Fire is reminiscent of a flame, rising upwards and ending with a point. It thus alludes to an upward movement, growing or expanding, to a centrifugal action, invasive and conquering. On the other hand Fire in itself has the impetuous tendencies of masculine energy; it provokes fury, and would be a destructive force if it were not mediated by the combination of the other Elements. It is primarily Water that works against the upward force of Fire , trickling downwards to fill every empty space or gap. Water acts as a squeezing, tightening force on that which is stretched and distended by Fire. Its action is therefore centripetal or constrictive. Instead of rising up vertically like Fire, it extends horizontally. Water thus tends towards repose and calm, which gives rise to a likening analysis between its passiveness and the feminine gentleness. To judge by its symbol , Air is nothing more than Fire that has been halted in its ascent, suffocated, extinguished by the horizontal line that crosses the fiery triangle, decapitating it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the interplay of the four elements is essential to grasp the workings of the universe. While Fire represents impetuosity and upward motion, Water is the restraint, pulling everything down towards balance and calmness. Air and Earth are the other two elements, with Air symbolizing the halted Fire and Earth being the solidification of Water. Ultimately, all individuals emanate from the center where their actions and egoism initiate, leading to the complex dynamics of the world around us."
