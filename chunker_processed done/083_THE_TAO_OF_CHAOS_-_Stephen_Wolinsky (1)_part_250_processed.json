  "title": "Navigating Psyche: Unraveling Identities and Trauma.",
  "first_phrase": "In this therapy session, the therapist and client delve into the client's psyche to explore her identities and their connections to her past. The therapist suggests that the \"in control\" identity is an age-regressed little girl who is attracted to her father, Carl. This is causing re-enactments of past romantic tragedies, which the client spites Carl for. The therapist helps the client identify what each identity seeks, with the pained little girl wanting to know herself above all else.",
  "content": "If Dad remains in her psyche, unless he is processed, it will cause more re-enactment of her tragic romantic. Client: Sadness. Therapist: Feel the sadness? Client: It is like when my father wasn't there anymore. Therapist: And how did you get even and spite him? Client: By not giving him what he wanted. Therapeutic Note Once again, notice the trance-ference of Dad on Carl, and how she spites Carl (Dad) by not giving him what he wants. This is the fallacy of control. Therapist: Ask the Carl (Dad) I-dentity, \"what are you seeking more than anything else\" Client: To be loved. Therapist: Now, go back again into the empty space, and ask the pain I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else?\" Client: Love. 202 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS Therapist: Now ask the little girl I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else?\" Client Security. Therapist: So that you will feel what? Client: Safe and peaceful. Therapist: And what does that pained little girl want more than anything else in the world? Client: To know herself.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to break free from the fallacy of control and overcome the trance-ference of Dad on Carl, the client needs to understand her deepest desires and seek the love, security, and power she truly deserves. By doing so, she can finally let go of the past and find peace in the present."
