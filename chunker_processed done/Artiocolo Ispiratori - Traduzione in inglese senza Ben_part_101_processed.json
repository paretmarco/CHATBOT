One such incident involves a medical student of Dr.Charlot, who had come to witness Donato's abilities. The student doubted the authenticity of Donato's act as he was taught that hypnosis only works on sick people. However, the student was eventually mesmerized by Donato's abilities and became overzealous, loudly testifying his admiration. The situation becomes troublesome when a round of spectators arrived.",

But after a while the student convinces himself, and at every phenomenon produced by the magnetizer, the overzealous loudly testifies his admiration. People begins to whisper about him - It's a stooge. Where this becomes too enthusiastic and troublesome is when a round of spectators coming for magnetizing arrived.",
