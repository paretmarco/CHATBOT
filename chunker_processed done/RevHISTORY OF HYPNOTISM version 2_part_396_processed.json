  "title": "What is Mesmerism and its Effect on Female Patients?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, we are presented with a detailed account of the mesmerism routine performed by Dr. Elliotson and Mr. Wood, which seems to have produced positive results on their patients, Elizabeth O'Key and Hannah Hunter. The patients are put into a state of insensibility by the mere act of having the doctor or his assistant extend an open hand towards their forehead. The text goes on to describe the physical and mental effects of this treatment, illustrated by the case of Elizabeth O'Key, who appears to regress to a childlike state after being mesmerized. The medical notes of these cases, which we'll see next, provide an interesting insight into this peculiar medical practice.",
  "content": "Both patients grow cold at the extremities; their pulse becomes so languid as to be scarcely felt; and they cannot be aroused by any of the ordinary means which never fail to disturb the slumber of the soundest sleepers. The extent to which this has been carried ineffectually will be best seen in the medical notes of the treatment of these cases, which we subjoin. These we obtained from one of the pupils, who took an especial interest in these proceedings, and will doubtless be more acceptable to medical readers than our own unprofessional observations. The most interesting case is that of the girl O'Key. Each time that we beheld her magnetised, or Mesmerised, she fell at first (for a minute or two) in the insensible state, and then stood up, exhibiting a new condition of existence, in which the ideas, language, and feelings, appeared thrown back into an artless, ignorant, puerile childhood.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the medical notes of these cases reveal the challenges faced in treating patients who cannot be awakened from a deep sleep induced by mesmerism. The curious case of O'Key highlights the peculiar effects of this condition, including a regression to a childlike state with impaired language skills. Despite these challenges, the patients' good feelings remain intact, and their memory is remarkably tenacious in some aspects."
