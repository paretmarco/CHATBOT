  "content": "What happened in the history was that the development of a variety of ‘theoretical views’ (e.g., Braid, 1843; Charcot, 1882) contributed to create of these two distinct branches: the hypnotic one and the magnetic one. Both branches interpreted the other in their own terms. As stated by a writer in the Revue Scientifique de la France et de la Étranger, hypnosis was seen either as a “particular case of induced hysteria,” or as the absorption of “animal magnetism into hypnotism according to Braid’s formula” (Héricourt, 1884, p. 813). On the other side, in the hypnotic field, skepticism about this hypothetical force was rampant. One author saw the “hypothesis of magnetic fluid” as one unsupported by “any good experimental demonstrations” - Richet, 1884, p. 221 – ( we should note that Richet was instead oriented toward a telepathic hypothesis). Hippolyte Bernheim (1840/1919), the leader of the Nancy school of hypnosis, affirmed that the phenomena of hypnosis “are not due to a magnetic fluid”; instead, he wrote “everything is due to suggestion” (Bernheim, 1884, p. 73).",
