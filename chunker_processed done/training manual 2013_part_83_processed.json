  "title": "\"The Seat of Subconscious: Connecting to the Cosmos through the Solar Plexus\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Wood's assertion that the microcircuits controlling the gut are situated at the effectors was explored. Now, we delve into how the enteric brain, centered at the solar plexus, is the seat of man's subconscious and enables his connection with the universal life force. The upper brain is limited in its capacity to comprehend the cosmos while the enteric brain senses and comprehends it. The solar plexus is fundamental in experiencing the universe, and when it is touched, we can truly \"know\" and \"sense\" it.",
  "content": "It is our second enteric brain, which senses, grasps and comprehends the “sense” of the cosmos. The upper brain can only study a little, write and talk and, above all, show off, even if it has no very clear idea of what it is talking about! Things have to be experienced in order to be understood, experienced with every fibre of one's being and when we say like this we want to say that we must experience them at our solar plexus. The one in charge, the one who controls and commands all the others, is the solar plexus in conjunction with the Hara centre, situated a little lower down. It is only at this point that we will have the impression to “know” them, to “sense” them. When you study, ponder and understand things intellectually it does not mean that you have touched the heart of the universe: no, this activity of the brain is no more than a first approach.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly comprehend the essence of the universe, one must move beyond intellectual understanding and tap into their solar plexus, where emotions and thoughts merge. It is only when we experience things with every fiber of our being that we can truly grasp their meaning and impact. So connect with your inner self, awaken your solar plexus, and connect with the heart of the universe."
