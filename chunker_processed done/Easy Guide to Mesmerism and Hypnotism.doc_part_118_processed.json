  "title": "\"Hypnotism: A Historical Perspective on Braid's Discoveries\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the discussion focuses on the work of Dr. Braid, who investigated mesmerism and hypnosis in the 19th century. Contrary to the beliefs of his time, Braid discovered the reality of the mesmerism phenomenon and created a new curative approach. His experiments revealed that during hypnosis, the senses of a patient, except sight, were magnified. Braid's research proved that hypnosis could cure various illnesses that were otherwise considered incurable, such as St. Vitus' dance or rheumatism.",
  "content": "He found abundant evidence from his own experiments of the reality of an induced state—nervous, mesmeric, or hypnotic sleep—which could be produced artificially; that in that state the senses, with the exception of sight, were wonderfully exalted—for instance, hearing and small became intensified. “Thus a patient who could not hear the ticking of a watch beyond three feet when awake, could do so when hypnotised at a distance of thirty-five feet, and walk to it in a direct line without difficulty or hesitation. Smell in like manner is so wonderfully exalted that a patient has been able to trace a rose through the air, when held forty-six feet, from her.” The reality of the phenomena grew upon this ardent and painstaking investigator and while adhering to his theoretical conceptions, he found in Hypnotism a new and powerful curative agent—rheumatism of ten years standing, deafness, neuralgia lumbago, spinal irritation, paralysis of sense and motion, St. Vitus' dance, tonic spasm, diseases of the skin, and many other apparently intractable diseases became obedient to his mystic power and departed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dr. Braid's meticulous investigations into the reality of hypnotic sleep not only proved its existence but also its potential as a powerful curative agent. His techniques were simple yet effective, demonstrating the power of physical stimulation in inducing states of hypnosis. The potential benefits of hypnosis in medical procedures are significant, offering patients a pain-free experience. With such promising results, it is clear that further exploration into hypnotism as a therapeutic intervention could revolutionize medical practice."
