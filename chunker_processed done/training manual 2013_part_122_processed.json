  "title": "\"Mastering Magnetic Attraction and Communication Through Conscious Awareness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the phenomena of thought-transference and unconscious-mind to unconscious-mind communication through magnetic education. It begins by highlighting how cultivating this ability can lead to perfect simulation of thought-transference. The author goes on to explain how this is achieved through unconscious associations formed between the experimenter's gestures and the subject's reflex movements. Moreover, the author draws a parallel between magnetic attraction and rapport and the concept of quantum entanglement, emphasizing how reaction can be obtained at a distance after the first contact. Finally, the text provides a practical exercise to help increase energy sensitivity, allowing individuals to experiment with magnetic passes and mental pushing and pulling.",
  "content": "Magnetic attraction and magnetic rapport is similar to the concept of quantum entanglement. After a first contact, reaction can be obtained also at a distance. Exercise to increase energy sensitivity Bring the person to a relaxing state and perform magnetic passes. Stay in front of him, gazing in his eyes, thinking the order “Go backward” When you see his body answering say him to close his eyes Go behind him Imagine to pull an invisible rope Repeat (there is no need to go in front of him each time) and increase the distance At a certain point you can also increase the difficulty pushing and pulling mentally the subject. NOTE: if you encounter difficulties you could ask the subject to let himself go consciously away backward toward you, so that the person could take confidence with your presence behind him (be careful if the subject makes some movements with his hands, it means he is in tension, therefore calm him by putting your hand on his hand).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the key of time and being in the present moment is crucial for practicing magnetism and energy sensitivity. By letting go of past experiences and focusing on the present, we can tap into our own energy and create a magnetic rapport with others, even from a distance. Try the exercise mentioned above to increase your energy sensitivity and improve your magnetic skills."
