  "title": "\"The Power of Instantaneous Hypnosis: Virgilio's Story\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discovered the story of Virgilio, a quiet man with incredible abilities. In the last 200 tokens, we witness the manifestation of Virgilio's powers as he makes customers feel ill and reads their minds. Despite the oddity of his demonstrations, people like Max are intrigued and keep returning to see Virgilio. In this section, we explore the source of Virgilio's gifts and the secrets he holds.",
  "content": "At that point, Virgilio carried out a facetious probative exercise: Faced with the question on what his name was, such customer answered by mentioning a womanâ€™s name which had not even been verbally suggested (to him by Virgilio), only through the power of thought. Virgilio thereupon woke him up. Moved by his curiosity, Max took to Virgilio a number of his friends, and witnessed similar events on several other occasions. Even I succeeded in experiencing on my own skin the power of this seemingly quiet person who, besides the ability I have just described, had also developed a special sensitivity to energies, to such an extent that he was a capable medical diviner equipped with the talent to retrieve an object concealed inside a room. Where does all of this originate?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the mind is truly remarkable and has the potential to improve our lives in ways we never thought possible. Learning to harness this power through techniques such as self-control, self-development, and self-improvement can lead to incredible experiences like those witnessed by Virgilio's friends and students. It is worth exploring the many avenues available to us in order to tap into our own innate abilities and reach our full potential."
