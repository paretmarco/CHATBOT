First element: The more we advance in our knowledge of magnetism, the more we understand how the spiritual world connects to the material world. In symbols: the fire of internal energy (magnetism) and matter are related. These elements are intuitions that are very similar to some modern tenets of physics. In modern physics, for example, matter and energy are connected. Mesmer’s idea was the same. Magnetism (in the sense of Mesmer) and matter are connected. They are two sides of the same reality. This means that there are no boundaries between the material world and the spiritual world.
