  "title": "\"The Alchemy of Spiritual Transformation: From Base Desires to True Freedom\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the alchemical process through which an adept attains purification and elevated spiritual fixedness. In this concluding part of the text, we delve deeper into the Magistry of the Sun. This concept involves the purification of the individual and the union of Sulphur and Mercury, symbolized by the marriage of the King and the Queen. The text describes how an adept, having attained spiritual purification and self-control, can capture and solidify Mercury, becoming the true king of their individual kingdom. Let's explore the inner workings of this process and the influential ideas of Nicolás Flamel.",
  "content": "Purified by Earth, Air, Water and Fire, he has undergone Putrefaction, from which he freed himself by Sublimation, which leads to Ablution and Spiritualisation. At that point, the Freemasons show him the Shining Star, the hermetic symbol being the Rose with five petals which emerges from the mercurial stone under the influence of the universal Spirit, if we are to refer to the influential figure of Nicolás Flamel. The Magistry of the Sun When the saline crust of the individual is purified and becomes transparent, the Light all around can be seen from within; and the red man (Sulphur ) falls in love with the white woman (Mercury). But the marriage of the King and the Queen has not yet taken place. In order for it to happen Mercury must be attracted; sympathising with the sublimated Sulphur, it lets itself be captured and solidified. Just as the Sulphur-King is the controlling force in us, so this is our will, freed from all pettiness and declaring itself the true King of its individual kingdom.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve the Magistry of the Sun, individuals must purify themselves internally, and relinquish their selfish desires, resulting in spiritualization. Through the Royal Art, one may find enlightenment and become worthy of the celestial Virgin. This mystical transformation is not just for mystics, but for all those who possess a pure ideal and conquer their egocentrism, freeing themselves from the tyranny of self."
