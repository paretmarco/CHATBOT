  "first_phrase": "This text explores the phenomenon of involuntary eye movements that occur in various mental and physical states, such as joy, pain, devotion, sleep, and approaching death. The use of such movements for inducing sleep is discussed, with hypnotists and mesmerists both utilizing the effect in different ways. The final 200 tokens of the text provide instructions on how to induce sleep by creating a comfortable and safe environment for the patient and removing any potential sources of anxiety or excitement. The text emphasizes the need for sensitivity and care when using these techniques and stresses the importance of involving interested parties in the patient's welfare.",
  "content": "Hypnotists deliberately weary the inferior muscles of the eyes, trusting to automatic inhibition of the nerve centres for the result desired. Success in certain directions indicates they are not far astray. The mesmerist standing above his patient, or sitting in a chair a little higher up than the patient unconsciously leads to the same automatic effect, but much more naturally. The hypnotist will cause the subject to strain his eyes at an object. The mesmerist desires his sensitive to be seated comfortably to look at him (the mesmerist), and if the sensitive or patient feel inclined to close his eyes, to do so, or to sleep, to do so—the latter process being more in harmony with nature than the former. HOW TO INDUCE SLEEP Make your patient feel at home, disabuse his mind of fear, doubt, anxiety, and scepticism (Mesmerise no one without the presence of some interested in the patient's welfare—parents, relatives, guardians, or medical adviser). Remove, if possible, all elements which are likely to arouse or excite the patient's mind. To succeed, the patient must either be naturally sensitive of your influence-—i.e., passive and receptive—or he must be made so.",
  "last_phrase": "To induce sleep through hypnosis, it is essential to create a comfortable and relaxed environment for the patient. Make sure to remove any distracting or arousing elements and reassure the patient of their safety. To gain the patient's trust, show confidence and expertise, and let them know you are fully committed to their welfare. With these techniques, you can successfully hypnotize the patient and guide them into a natural and peaceful sleep state."
