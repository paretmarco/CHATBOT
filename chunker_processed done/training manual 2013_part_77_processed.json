  "title": "\"The Power of Magnetism: Activating Your Enteric Brain\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the profound impact of the law of suggestion on psychic science. Now, we delve into some of the physiological tenets of animal magnetism, including the enteric brain and the power of magnetism to activate it. The text includes practical instructions for animal magnetism from the work \"Practical Instructions in Animal Magnetism.\" The text advises on how to prepare someone for magnetism and how to perform the technique, including the exact positions for the magnetizer and the magnetized individual.",
  "content": "Then lake his thumbs between your fingers, in such a manner, that his and your thumbs may be applied to each other; you are to remain in this position, till you feel that they have acquired an equal temperature.\" \"The hands are then to be placed on the shoulders, and suffered to remain there two1 or three minutes, and afterwards gently brought down the arms to the thumbs; this manoeuvre is to be repeated three or four times. Then the two hands are to be placed over the pit of the stomach, so that the thumbs are over the solar plexus, and the fingers on the ribs.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating this magnetism technique into your healing regimen can activate your enteric brain and improve your overall well-being. Remember to follow the steps carefully and always turn your palms outwards to ensure optimal benefits. Don't forget that healing involves more than just your brain in your head and activating your second brain, the enteric brain, can be a powerful tool for true healing."
