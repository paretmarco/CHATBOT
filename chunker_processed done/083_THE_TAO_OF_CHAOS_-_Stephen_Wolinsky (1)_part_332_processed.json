  "title": "\"Advanced Attention Training & Finding Essential Self\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the client expressed fear of being overwhelmed with grief when asked to move from the empty space to the grief. In this last part, the therapist emphasizes the biological nature of grief and introduces the concept of the essential self. The text concludes by explaining that we are not limited to one character type or fixation and that processing and exploring them can lead to freedom. Additionally, it introduces the idea of advanced attention training and tension as a compensation for perceived lack.",
  "content": "Conclusion To conclude, this fixation and this section I would like to reiterate we are not one character type or one fixation of attention. The universe is in constant motion. Therefore we are a combination of character types and fixations of attention. Furthermore, we move from one fixation to another in a very specific pattern. Therefore, temporarily know and process your fixations and move on to the next one. Realize that there is probably one that will take a long time to get to know. In this knowing and familiarity, awareness will build and freedom will come from the effects of the fixation and the trauma of loss of being explored. This will ultimately lead to cutting the chains of personality or in its yoga terms, loosening the knot of the heart. ‘117 Z LAN iml — CI > Z = W LI'l ADVANCED ATTENTION TRAINING I tn 111.1 OCIAttention: \"The concentration of the %) 0mind on an object.\" (American College ZDictionary, p. 80) lj-tension is where the observer/person- Imi imiality over fixates its a-tension to over- compensate for its weakness or feel- •ing of lack.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to recognize that we are a combination of character types and fixations of attention, constantly moving from one fixation to the next. By acknowledging our fixations and familiarizing ourselves with them, we can build awareness and ultimately cut the chains of our personality, leading to freedom and loosening the knot of the heart. Through advanced attention training, we can learn to concentrate our minds on objects and overcome our weaknesses and feelings of lack."
