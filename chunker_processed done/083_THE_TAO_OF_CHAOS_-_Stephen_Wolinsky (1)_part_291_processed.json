  "title": "\"Psychopathic Structures vs. Psychopathology in Society\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the author discussed the societal psychopathology and how victims are often perceived as perpetrators while the real culprits are seen as the innocent ones. The author then provided examples from the male victims of sexual abuse to illustrate the societal double standard and how it negatively affects the victims. The last 200 tokens explain the difference between having a psychopathic structure or trance and being a psychopath. While everyone has psychopathic structures and trances that resist powerlessness, true psychopaths objectify others and feel no remorse. The author clarifies that having psychopathic structures and trances is not the same as being a psychopath.",
  "content": "Research has shown that almost all men who are sexual abusers were sexually abused. Yet, because of society's psychopathology and the hypnotic trance given to the young boy, few come to therapy for treatment of sexual dysfunction, i.e., premature ejaculation, impotence, or child molestation. Psychopathic Structures vs. Psychopathology Let me at this point clarify the difference between having a psychopathic structure or trance and being a psychopath. The little girl/boy, who is molested and feels powerless, manipulates their internal state to being in charge of the perpetrator and powerful, to resist the feelings of powerlessness and victimization. This is a psychopathic trance or structure. On the other hand, a psychopath is one whose entire personality is so integrated into power and manipulation and has such resistance to powerlessness that they are unaware of pow- ________________ erlessness. The true psychopath objectifies others and feels no remorse for these actions. This lack of remorse and the total objectification of another person is psychopathic. In other words, we all have psychopathic structures and trances which resist powerlessness automatically, we, however, feel remorse, it is not our entire personality. With a true psychopath, it is their entire personality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the difference between having a psychopathic structure or trance and being a psychopath is crucial when it comes to seeking treatment for sexual dysfunction caused by sexual abuse. Knowing that we all have psychopathic structures and trances that resist powerlessness automatically, but feel remorse, can help us identify and address these issues, leading to a healthier and happier life."
