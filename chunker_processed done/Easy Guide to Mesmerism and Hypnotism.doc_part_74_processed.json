  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we delve into the history of mesmerism in various cultures and religions. The Persan mages, for instance, had principles that were similar to animal magnetism, whereas the ancient Romans had their own methods of healing using sleep and breath. Furthermore, we discuss the continuation of these methods in modern-day France through hypnotic wonders that are similar to the religious manifestations of the ancient Druidic temples.",
  "content": "“I will not suffer persons,” says Varro, “to deny that the Sibyl has given men good counsel during her life, and that she left after death predictions which are still eagerly consulted on all difficult emergencies. It is recorded in St. Justin '“that the Sibyls spoke many great things with justice and truth and that when the instinct which animated them ceased to exist, they lost the recollections of all they had declared.” According to Celsus, Asclepiades put to sleep, by means of frictions, those affected by frenzy. Where their frictions were prolonged, the patient was plunged into a deep lethargic sleep. Heidenhain's “cutaneous irritations” seem to be the legitimate successors of Asclepiades, Motions. There can be no doubt that the effects produced in these and in similar instances were identical in character with the mesmeric phenomena of to-day. MESMERISM IN FRANCE. The modern Frenchman, like his ancient forbear, the Gaul, is particularly susceptible to mesmeric influences. Its present day hypnotic wonders are but the continuation, in another phase, of the higher religious manifestations, which took place amid the mystic surroundings of the Druidic temples.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, throughout history, various forms of divination and healing have been documented, from the Sibyls of ancient times to the mesmerism in France during the Middle Ages. These practices have evolved and transformed over time, but their underlying principles and effects on individuals have remained. Today, we continue to explore different forms of healing, from traditional medicine to alternative therapies, to improve our health and wellbeing."
