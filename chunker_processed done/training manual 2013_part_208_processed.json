  "title": "\"The Power of Panoramic and Incisive Vision: Self-Training for Positive Purposes\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the practical benefits of developing a panoramic and incisive vision that can encompass both the totality and the detailed particulars, focusing on the power of the eyes in the field of persuasion. Before delving into the exercises to develop this power, we must learn to achieve firm power over our own selves, mastering our impulses, emotions, desires, and the mental plane. Only then can we transform them into a positive instrument that guides our strengths and our eye in a conscious fashion. This ability to enchant is not unique to humans, but only man is capable of steering it toward positive and development-bound purposes. The text ends with the story of snakes gifted with special faculties to cast their charm upon their victims and disable them from shunning their spires.",
  "content": "The first level of exercises which help develop this power properly is in fact based on mastering oneâ€™s own body and its impulses, emotions, violent desires, and the mental plane with its characteristic digressions and instability. The aim behind it is that all of the aforesaid should submit to the higher self and should transform into a positive instrument that guides our strengths and our eye in a conscious fashion, one which is not abandoned to dependence on mere instinctiveness. The ability to enchant, indeed, is not only human, yet only man is capable of steering it toward positive and development-bound purposes. Animals capture prey through the look as well, but only in an unconscious manner. There have always been tales of snakes gifted with special faculties to cast their charm upon their victim and thereby disable it from shunning its spires; their power reaches such an extreme degree that they cause birds to step down, draw closer, and let themselves be grabbed without being able to offer any resistance in an attempt at self-protection.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to develop the power of enchantment, it is essential to master our own impulses and transform them into a positive instrument that guides us consciously. Although animals possess this power, only humans can steer it towards development and progression. So, let us harness this power and use it for good, being aware of how it affects others and ourselves."
