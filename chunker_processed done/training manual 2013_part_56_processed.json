  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, we delve into the power of Magnetic patients and their ability to investigate the condition of their own bodies and even those of others. The concept of animal magnetism is presented as a way of reconnecting with our natural selves and unlocking the potential within. Before this, the text discusses the split between our inner and outer reality, and how our constant thought-chattering can negatively impact our wellbeing. The text proposes simple techniques like hypnosis and presence to help us return to a natural state of being.",
  "content": "Magnetism is from the point of view of the everyday's person a “shared trance” where two people feel an energetic reality. But in reality who is in a trance is the person that calls it “trance”. 1. THE SPLIT BETWEEN OUR INNER AND OUTER REALITY Many people believe that their only reality is only the ego-chattering that goes inside their heads. How many thoughts do we have each day? Some people say 50000 or 60000; are they all useful? Thinking that ego chattering is the basis of existence is a distorted idea of reality. When we have this continuous chattering we dissociate from the world and we reduce ourselves. Many times this thought chattering is even destructive and in this case people go to therapy. There are in fact paths to come back to a well-being before words, a wellbeing that is our natural state. These paths are represented both by simple techniques, as hypnosis, where momentarily we enter in a state of non duality. Also what we call in our courses \"presence\" has a same goal.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we should be aware that our inner reality is not the only reality, and that we are connected to the world around us. Techniques such as hypnosis, presence, magnetism, and fascination can help us reconnect with our natural state of well-being, beyond the constant chatter of our minds. By acknowledging our connection to the external world, we can achieve a more fulfilling existence."
