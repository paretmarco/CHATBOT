  "title": "What is the mysterious phenomenon experienced by Elizabeth O'Key during Mesmerism sessions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, a description of a peculiar and inexplicable phenomenon was given, in which two young girls appeared to enter a state of magnetic semi-existence after undergoing the process of mesmerism. Despite the skepticism of some, including the renowned Professor Faraday, it remains a mysterious occurrence. In this concluding section, the author provides professional notes on the cases of the two girls. One of them, Elizabeth O'Key, was afflicted with epilepsy and had undergone mesmerism treatment, resulting in a deep sleep and fits of delirium. The notes shed light on the effectiveness and benefits of mesmerism in treating certain medical conditions.",
  "content": "The requisite movement is performed by drawing the thumbs (or a finger of each hand) from the top of the nose along the eyebrows, outwards to the temples, quickly and steadily, two or three times. We shall now subjoin the professional notes bearing on the cases of these two girls, only observing that the medical student who drew them up employs the word \"Mesmerism\" to express the operation or influence, which is, in ordinary, known by the name we have employed as most familiar to the majority of readers,â€”viz., \"animal magnetism.\" NOTES BY A PUPIL. \"Elizabeth O'Key, aged seventeen, was admitted last April, labouring under epilepsy; the fits came on every few days, scarcely at longer intervals than a week. Baron Dupotet commenced practising Mesmerism in her case last summer. At first a deep sleep was produced, and during the continuance of this process, the fits came on at longer intervals. After a time, a different effect was produced, and fits of delirium, in which she lost entirely sensation, came on spontaneously at intervals, and were always removed by Mesmerism, but never caused without this process.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Mesmerism, also known as animal magnetism, has shown to have both positive and negative effects in the medical field. It has been observed to reduce the frequency of fits in epilepsy patients, inducing delirium and removing it. However, caution must be exercised when using this technique as it can induce an altered state of consciousness without the patient's knowledge. The technique involves making movements with the hand, and anyone can produce it."
