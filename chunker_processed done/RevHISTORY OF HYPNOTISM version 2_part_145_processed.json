  "title": "\"The Phenomena of Somnambulism and Magnetic Ecstasy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, M. Deleuze talked about the enlightening nature of somnambulism on man's spirituality and existence. Now the focus shifts to another magnetic phenomenon - Magnetic Ecstasy. This state is where the mind contemplates without reflection. The text explores the possible origins of this state and draws a comparison between the three-tier oven in alchemical practices and the Chinese concept of the three tan tien. The text mentions how magnetism can help create a state of expanded consciousness by bringing energy to the top of the head, linked to the pituitary gland and thalamus. Music can enhance the results.",
  "content": "An ancient Western tradition is represented by the athanor. The athanor is a three-tier oven, and it is the symbol of the human organism in which the great work of regeneration is effected.81 The three-tier symbol82 is the same as the Eastern concept of the three tan tien, which differentiates between three areas of the body (cinnabar fields), corresponding to the area of the navel, the heart and the head.83 In the Chinese tradition, one finds a manner of operating which gradually ascends from the lower to the higher tan tien. In magnetism we can equally bring energy to the top of head. We create in this way what is called “magnetic ecstasy”. Physiologically this point of the body (also called ‘vertex’) could be envisioned somewhat connected to the pituitary gland, which secretes hormones to communicate to the rest of the endocrine system and also connects to the central nervous system via the hypothalamus. The thalamus is thought to have a key role in the physical basis of consciousness. In magnetism we can do the same and get to expanded state of consciousness.. The results depend on practice. Music can enhance results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ancient Western tradition of the athanor and the Eastern concept of the three tan tien are symbolic representations of the human body and its potential for regeneration. The practice of magnetism, bringing energy to the top of the head, can lead to a state of magnetic ecstasy and an expanded state of consciousness. While music can enhance the results, the theories of Puysegur show that the focus should be on the practice rather than the theory."
