  "title": "\"The Power of Light: Enhancing Perception and Creativity\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, it was discussed how light can excite neurons to their maximum extent, leading to an evolution of creativity. Now, we delve into the concept of the universe as a whole and how our perception only exercises certain parts of it. This theory is developed by Pribram and Bohm, who explain how every sense works by refocusing specific elements and discerning reasonable quantities. In the end, removing the lenses of our senses leaves nothing but a hologram. This deep exploration helps us understand the significance of the reflected life and the diaphanous.",
  "content": "In order to attempt an explanation of its usefulness, we are going to resort at this stage to a series of reflections founded on modern quantic theory. The Universe is a whole. From this whole, our perception “exercises” some parts. These parts correspond to certain states of vibration on the part of our neurons. For example, the neurons of the visual cortex must be activated in a manner which differs from the way by which we perceive a mountain. This concept likewise lies at the heart of the homonymic??? theory developed by Pribram and by Bohm: \"Every sense works like a lens, by refocusing the visual waves both through the perception of specific elements which are repeated as the basis, and through the discernment of a reasonable amount of quantities. If we remove the lenses, nothing is left but a hologram”. As every sense operates by refocusing in accordance with certain mechanisms, it is difficult to regain access to the WHOLE.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, our perception of reality is limited by the mechanisms of our senses, which refocus the sensory input to create a representation of the world that is comprehensible to us. However, modern quantum theory suggests that this representation is merely a reflection of a larger, all-powerful whole. By understanding the limitations of our perception, we can begin to explore the true nature of reality and our place within it."
