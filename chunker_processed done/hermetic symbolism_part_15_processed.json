  "title": "\"The Philosophers' Geometry: Exploring Symbols and Initiation Rites\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous sections, the author emphasizes on the significance of rising above everyday reality and becoming an artist to play their role in the divine comedy of the world. The text explores the attention of new initiates being drawn to symbols and graphic forms that encourage the development of thinking. In this final part, the author delves into the philosophy of hermeticism and the significance of understanding alchemical symbols to gain true wisdom. The text highlights the importance of a spiritual and artistic geometry that links ideas to shapes and interpret symbols composed of lines, akin to the way geometers read their figures.",
  "content": "In the following pages we will not discuss the initiation rites, having studied this topic in some depth already in Mysteries of the Royal Art. Nor will we deal with the objects of worship displayed by many hierophants, nor even with actual images, of which none are more revealing than the cards of the tarot. We limit ourselves in this book to examining the graphic forms which encourage the development of thinking, and we will centre particularly on the analysis of alchemical symbols, which hold the key to hermeticism, a philosophy far removed from words and of which true understanding is reserved for the true initiates. The Philosophersâ€™ Geometry None shall enter here who do not know geometry. This was the warning notice that divided the school of Plato from those who would simply listen, unable or unwilling to think for themselves. The geometry of the cordial philosopher was not, in fact, that of Euclides , the science of measurement and space, with its theorems and demonstrations. This was another geometry, of a more subtle spirituality, more of an art than a science; an art that consisted of linking ideas to shapes, and of interpreting symbols composed of lines in the same way as geometers read their figures.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this book explores the graphic forms that promote critical thinking and focuses on analyzing alchemical symbols. By delving into the subtle spirituality of philosopher's geometry and working to interpret symbols ourselves, we can unlock the fundamental ideas of human intelligence and find our own truth."
