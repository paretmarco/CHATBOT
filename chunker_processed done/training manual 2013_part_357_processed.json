  "title": "\"Guide to Channeling Energy and Focus through Touch and Breathing\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section delves into further details on exercises that can help enhance one's receptivity to magnetism as well as reconnect to one's essence. The text explains the importance of using the right touch, which depends on the client's sensibility, and how magnetic passes can deepen rapport. The exercise discussed is focused on centering one's attention on the abdominal area or hara while practicing deep breathing. This technique is likened to the motionless state techniques of Chinese inner alchemy. The word Vitriol can also be understood in this sense, as a way to discover the essence through inward exploration.",
  "content": "Refer in this connection to the exercise of “integral breathing” which has been quoted in the second part of the book, as it, too, can facilitate the process. We can detect a resemblance between this phase and the techniques (to be carried out in a motionless state) of Chinese inner alchemy: “One focus his attention on the navel until he is able to attain a perfect state of calm and a heedful control of his breathing. While steeped in such silent layers of darkness, our organs reach such a sensibility as to be enabled to perceive every imperceptible movement inside the body. Suddenly, something is set into motion: The essence, after being concentrated for long, now fills the abdomen”. 106 The abovementioned word Vitriol might in any event be understood even in this sense: I visit my inner side (and the area of the navel amounts to the physiological equivalent of such inward part), and I then begin to discover the concealed stone (the essence, a basic quintessence).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing exercises like integral breathing and Chinese inner alchemy, we can expand our consciousness and perception of reality, detach ourselves from programmed time, and ultimately gain a better understanding of the only true medicine ─ the reintegration of all our faculties. Avoid being caught in quotidian microtrances, and live in the present moment."
