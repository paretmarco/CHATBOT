  "title": "\"Developing Sensory Acuity: The Importance Highlighted by Chevalier de Lausanne\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the focus was on animal magnetism and how it relies on our sensory acuity. Animals possess more sensitivity than humans, which is why the Chevalier de Lausanne emphasized the importance of developing sensitivity. In this final part, we will dive deeper into the chevalier's teachings and how he and Bruno approached psychic diagnosis. They possessed the ability to perceive and describe the internal condition of those they were in rapport with, and could even prescribe successful remedies. Additionally, their lucid vision extended beyond the present existence, allowing them to foretell with accuracy events that would happen. Though they remembered nothing in their normal state, they exhibited continuous memory when thrown into somnambulism. The Chevalier de Lausanne's teachings have been influential in the field of mesmerism, which aims to unlock the full potential of the human psyche through heightened sensitivity.",
  "content": "Developing sensory acuity means not only seeing all simple physical elements around you, but also being conscious of a world of sensorial messages that we filter out most of the time. Scientists have observed that as we look at an object, for example a wall, we also gain a “feeling” of it. This feeling is partly constituted by our past experiences in touching similar objects, but it also contains some other information that relies more on a space that people call “intuition”. In our modern culture we unconsciously filter many of these elements when they reach our senses. We must strive to recover them. Animals and children are probably naturally sensitive to them. We too we must recover this sensitivity, since it means recovering a part of ourselves. The chevalier de Lausanne was one of the first mesmerists: he described the method created by a certain Bruno, who worked not only with magnetic induction, but also with psychic diagnosis: 1. Establish contact by means of the thumb, 2. Hold it for the space of a few minutes; 3. Have an active Will while centering your attention on the Subject. 4.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing sensory acuity can be a challenging task, but it allows us to reconnect with the hidden and intuitive world that surrounds us. By following the steps described by Bruno and Lausanne, we can use our willpower and attention to recover our lost sensitivity and become more aware of the sensorial messages that we unconsciously filter out."
