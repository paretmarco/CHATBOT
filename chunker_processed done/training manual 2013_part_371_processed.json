  "title": "\"Unlocking Clairvoyance and Clairaudience through Transcending the Ego\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section discusses how to transcend the ego, allowing the manifestation of new ways of being and the potential for direct action on the body. To achieve this, the reintegration of sub-sensorialities or \"spiritual senses\" such as clairvoyance and clairaudience is necessary. The author explains how these senses can be developed through \"work in the white\" and the importance of mental lucidity and intuition. Additionally, the utilization of light can aid in the development of higher intelligence.",
  "content": "Intuition (from the Latin “in tueri”) indicates turning one’s look towards an inner world.114 Intuition is the voice of the heart, that consciousness which allows man to orientate himself without errors as far as the correct accomplishment and actualization of his individuality are concerned.115 In other terms, what takes place in this particular phase consists in the reawakening of the individual’s strengths and thought, the refinement of the sensory apparatus, and an increasingly vaster field of expansion and realization of the individual’s faculties. Simultaneously, magnetism, too, is increased. Utilization of light in order to excite the brain Apart from the inward disposition, an aid to the development of this higher ”intelligence” is found in light, understood in the sense of a physical element which impacts on our physiology and acts on it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, intuition can lead us towards a deeper understanding of the self, while the use of physical light can aid in the development of higher intelligence. In order to enhance one's mental image of light and increase magnetism, the sagacious use of white light can prove to be beneficial. Through exercises such as recalling the memory of the visual reflection of light, one can train themselves to expand their faculties and reach a state of plenitude."
