  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Deleuze shared instructions for preparing oneself and the patient, including positioning and attuning to each other's energy. In this final part, he describes the physical movements and hand gestures necessary to perform passes or downward movements to balance the body's vital fluid, acting as a conductor for energy flow. Deleuze emphasizes the power of eye contact and recommends both the operator and client keep their gaze intently upon one another to create a \"quantum entanglement\" that enhances the process's efficacy. The entire process takes as little as 5-10 minutes, and with practice, these techniques can create a positive impact on the patient's overall wellness.",
  "content": "At this point you will move your hands to the right and left, waving them so that the interior surface is turned outwards, and you will then raise them as high as the head, place them upon the shoulders, leave them there for a minute and then draw them along the arm to the extremity of the fingers, touching gently. 6. You will then commence the passes or downward movements of the hands; at a little distance from the body over the face and chest, to about as far as the pit of the stomach; sweeping them off a little before re-ascending; then descend slowly along the body as far as the knees, and if convenient to the ends of the feet—you may repeat the processes during the greater part of the sitting. \"— Deleuze.

These simple yet powerful exercises can be completed in as little as 5 minutes and can be a valuable addition to any therapeutic practice."
