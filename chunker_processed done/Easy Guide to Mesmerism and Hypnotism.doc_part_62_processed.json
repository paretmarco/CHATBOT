  "first_phrase": "This text explores the perplexing nature of hypnotism and various sensory disturbances that can arise from it. The phenomena studied point to a physiological condition triggered by specific areas of the brain and cord. This section highlights the observations of various researchers such as Heidenhain, Gritzner, and Charcot, who found that certain actions or stimuli could lead to highly specific responses in the body. Whilst some of the phenomena cannot be accounted for, enough has been stated to give a rational explanation for some of them. It emphasizes that hypnotism must not be used for the sake of amusement, nor by untrained individuals.",
  "content": "All colours appeared grey in different degrees of brightness, from a dirty dark grey to a clear silvery grey. These facts are interesting as showing perverted sensation in the particular individual affected, but they throw no light on the condition of hypnotism. It is evident then that animal magnetism or hypnotism is a peculiar physiological condition excited by perverted action of certain parts of the cerebral nervous organs, and that it is not caused by any occult force emanating from the operator. Editor's note: What Dr. Coates wanted to explain was that the influence is from mind to mind and that the actions are always mediated by the central system. Whilst all the phenomena cannot be accounted for, owing- to the imperfect knowledge we possess of the functions of the brain and cord, enough has been stated to show that just in proportion as our knowledge has increased has it been possible to give a rational explanation of some of the phenomena. It is also clear that the perverted condition of the nervous apparatus of hypnotism is of a serious character, and therefore that these experiments should not be performed by ignorant empirics for the sake of gain or with the view of causing amusement.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the study of hypnotism or animal magnetism shows that it is a peculiar physiological condition that can be both beneficial and harmful. It is crucial to be cautious and avoid the use of ignorant empirics to prevent injuries to individuals. However, when in the hands of skilled professionals, hypnotism can be a means of relieving pain or remedying disease in a non-invasive manner."
