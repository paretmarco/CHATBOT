  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we talked about two techniques to enhance eye power – the numerological method of Virgilio T. and the Bishoff Method. In this last part, we explore other designs and traditions based on symbols to achieve the same goal. We will look into some ancient drawings that could enhance eye power, like the one depicted in the image above (Kings-Gnostics, p. 238). The image portrays the attributes for each day of the week surrounding the eye in the form of a deity who presides over them. The deities are symbolized by different animals like the Lion, Fawn, Scorpion, and Dog. The Thunderbolt appears to be the symbol of God Jupiter, and the Owl represents the Goddess Venus. These symbols could be used by practitioners to enhance their eye power.",
  "content": "Other designs and traditions based on symbols In addition to traditions of safe source, we refer now to some ancient drawings we received that could probably have the same goal of strengthening the eye power, which initiates to the technique can still use in this direction. Particularly significant is the image above (Kings-Gnostics, p. 238) where the attributes for each day of the week surround the eye, in the form of the deity who presides over each of them. These deities are symbolized by the Lion for the Dies Solis (Sunday), the Fawn for Dies Lunae (Monday - Diana Venatrix), the Scorpion for Dies Martis (Tuesday), the Dog for Dies Mercurii. The Thunderbolt appears to be the symbol of God Jupiter, and the Owl (sacred to Athena and Minerva) must have been inserted as a symbol of the Goddess Venus, since Venus is not considered as a protector towards fascination, while Minerva was always a patron deity and carried on her shield Medusa’s head.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these ancient designs and symbols provide fascinating insights into the ways in which different cultures and traditions have sought to enhance eye power and psychic projection. By understanding and interpreting these symbols, we can potentially tap into their power and use them to improve our own eye health and magnetism."
