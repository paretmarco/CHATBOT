  "title": "Deep Hypnotic States: Benefits and Connection with Quantum Level",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous 200 tokens, we learned about the deep hypnotic states induced by non-verbal techniques developed by Swiss magnetizer Lafontaine. These states bring clients to a space before the ego, connecting them with a deeper level of being, allowing for spontaneous healings and transformations. In this final section, we learn about the deep entanglement between operator and subject, where the development of deeper states requires involvement of the operator's unconscious mind. This is a relearning of detachment, as the modern world teaches.",
  "content": "He will also be beyond his past conditioning. He will be more in touch with his inner core where he can connect to a natural wisdom that heals spontaneously. Many times people will also say what the best way to treat him is, or the words which will be more suitable for his transformation. In these states you could touch a level of joy and a deep discovery of the self which you didnâ€™t imagine could exist. As a fact, there are many hypnotists who practice hypnotherapy without practicing them. But it is true that if you learn them you will greatly enhance your practice. A strange fact is the deep entanglement which occurs between operator and subject as this kind of hypnosis is developed. These deeper states depend in fact on the state of the operator. Therefore their development implies a deep participation and involvement even from the part of the operator. This more than simple emotional involvement, is an involvement of the unconscious mind. The modern world teaches us to be detached, and we must relearn this approach.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning hypnosis techniques leads to a deeper participation and involvement, resulting in the operator's state of mind affecting the subject's state of mind. Through the development of these techniques, one can access deeper states of joy and self-discovery, leading to a connection with natural wisdom that spontaneously heals. Taking a human approach, as ancient hypnotists and magnetists did, allows for healing through resonance and entanglement with the underlying interconnecting reality."
