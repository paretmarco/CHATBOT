  "title": "\"The Search for Perfection Outside of Essence\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores how fixation on moralistic virtues and over perfectionism stems from the trauma of losing Essence, which is perfection itself. The personality fixates on becoming super moral or religiously fanatic to compensate for the deep inadequacy and self-blame caused by this loss. In this way, perfection is sought outside of Essence in the observer/personality dyad and the world. In the final 200 tokens, the author gives an example of a client who overcompensates for her feelings of imperfection by seeking perfection in all the wrong places outside of Essence.",
  "content": "It might be said that not only is the personality inadequate compared to Essence, but also the personality blames itself for its inadequacy and its lack of perfection. For example, I saw a client who was obsessed with integrity and being moral. She was very judgmental and always seeking and questioning her own integrity. The problem was that she had decided that money was bad and immoral, and that people who had money were \"out of integrity.\" Simply put, she was trying to be perfect and super moral as an overcompensation for her own feeling that she was imperfect and not good enough. This dyad of unworthy imperfect trying to be perfect was personality's attempt to substitute for the perfection that is Essence. In other words, she was trying to have ________________ THE TAO OF CHAOS â€¢ 165 a perfect personality, which is not possible. Like the song, she was \"Looking for love in all the wrong places.\" She was looking for perfection in all the wrong places; outside of Essence in the observer/personality dyad and the world through a substituted image of perfection. In this way, she was looking for perfection outside, in all the wrong places, rather than inside in Essence.",
  "last_phrase": "In essence, striving for a perfect personality as a substitute for perfection in Essence is a futile endeavor. It is essential to look inward and embrace the imperfections, rather than seeking perfection externally. Strive to find the key to your nature within yourself, rather than looking for it in all the wrong places."
