  "content": "“In 1900 Hypnosis had not replaced mesmerism at the end of the nineteenth century, but still existed alongside it” (Pintar & Lynn, 2008, p. 9114). And in fact, magnetism, and its variants, continues to be defended (mostly in Europe) by serious students during the late nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries and obviously by thousands of practitioners. Even today the ideas born out of the school of animal magnetism, are with us in many guises (e.g., Movaffaghi & Farsi, 2009; Nelson & Schwartz, 2005).”15 As pointed out by Meheust (1999), two distinct approaches were at work, the reductionist one and the not reductionist. Many scientists, even in this century, continue looking upon the mysteries of the healing obtained by the magnetic method. As we will see at the end of this book, there is a ‘something’, or even more “something’s” that need to be uncovered and that rely on the human being. Learning from everybody. In this book we try to learn something from all ancient magnetists. It will help you in doing a better therapy and better understanding this wonderful discipline.",
