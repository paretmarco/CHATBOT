  "title": "\"What is the Effect of Mirrors and Polarized Light on the Mind and Can They Produce Visionary Experiences?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the strange effects produced by mirrors on the mind and how modern science explains them. Before that, it talks about the experiments of Dupotet where some subjects saw visions in the mirror. These experiments sometimes involved psychometry and drew fascination from those who looked at the mirror. The effects are related to polarized light, which has powerful effects on the mind and enhances inner perceptions. Dr. Lefebure did research on this aspect and found that coherence is a key factor in quantistic effects. This last section of the text dives deeper into these concepts to better understand the effects of mirrors on the mind.",
  "content": "Some subjects, on the other hand, were not affected by the mirror at all.127 The effect of mirrors and polarized light on the mind Modern science can explain why mirrors are so powerful and why they produce such strange effects. In fact what appears is that mirrors enhance some inner perceptions. On the psychological and energetic planes, the mirror reflects the energy of the person who is staring, and on a physical plane it also creates a polarized light effect, that operates on the mind by further enhancing these inner perceptions, and creating visual distorsions that allow subconscious elements to become more evident. Dr. Lefebure did much research on the effects on mirrors. It seems that polarized light has some powerful effects on the mind128. From ancient times visions are often connected with light and even more often with reflected lights. Light in itself brings the visual cortex to its maximum level of excitation. Polarized light in some way creates a more coordinated reaction in the brain. It is probable that many neurons operate together in a very coherent way, and coherence is a key factor in quantistic effects. In direct radiation, the waves of light circulate in all directions: this is what we mean by diffused light (1).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of mirrors and polarized light on the mind is undeniable. While the effects can be strange and unusual, they can also enhance inner perceptions and bring subconscious elements to the surface. Understanding the science behind this phenomenon can provide a deeper appreciation of just how profound the impact of light can be on our perception and consciousness."
