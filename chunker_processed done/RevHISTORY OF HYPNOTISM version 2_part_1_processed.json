  "first_phrase": "The History of Hypnotism, Animal Magnetism, and Instant Healings delves into the fascinating world of animal magnetism and hypnotism from the time of Mesmer. The book is anchored not only in research but in practical hands-on experience with ancient magnetic techniques guided by current practitioners. In the final 200 tokens, the concept of vital fluid and practical metaphysics is explored, with quotes from Baron Du Potet and Schopenhauer. These ideas shed light on the unique approach to healing used by those who practice traditional magnetic techniques in the western world.",
  "content": "HISTORY OF HYPNOTISM, ANIMAL MAGNETISM AND INSTANT HEALINGS Le fluide n'est point une substance qui puisse être pesée, mesurée, condensée. C'est une force vitale. (Baron Du Potet) The vital fluid is not something you can weigh, measure or condense. It is a vital force. (Baron Du Potet) \"Considered...[from] the philosophical point of view, animal magnetism is the most pregnant of all discoveries that have ever been made, although for the time being it propounds rather than solves riddles. It is really practical metaphysics..[A] time will come when philosophy, animal magnetism, and natural science...will shed so bright a light on one another that truths will be discovered at which we could not otherwise hope to arrive\" (Schopenauer) Introduction This book will trace the fortunes and developments of Animal Magnetism and Hypnotism from the time of Mesmer. It is a practical book based not only on study, but also on our practical experience with the use of ancient techniques guided by people who still practice the original magnetic techniques. These people we have met live in the western world, and heal in a different way from traditional medicine and psychology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the history of hypnotism and animal magnetism shows that the power of our minds and bodies to heal themselves goes beyond what traditional medicine and psychology offer. By cultivating innate capacities, we can tap into a powerful force within ourselves to achieve stunning results in healing and overall well-being."
