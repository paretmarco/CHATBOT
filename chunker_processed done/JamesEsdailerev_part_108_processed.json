  "title": "\"The Enlightenment Figures Who Practiced Animal Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses Esdaile’s strong belief in the \"vital agent\" and how he based his opinions on his own experiences. The author mentions that Esdaile's experiences led him to adopt the fluid theory as the only possible explanation of the effects produced by his method. However, the author notes that Esdaile did not investigate the psychic and cosmic aspects of Animal Magnetism. The author also mentions the numerous trustworthy individuals who reported the facts of Animal Magnetism, including physicians, physiologists, naturalists, philosophers, and theologians.",
  "content": "But it has been alleged that the evidence of these enlightened individuals is liable to discredit because, forsooth, they were engaged in investigating the phenomena of Animal Magnetism. Assuredly, this is a strange, and, we must take the liberty of saying, most preposterous objection. Pray, how are the facts of Nature to be discovered and appreciated unless by those who take an interest in investigating them?\" Esdaile’s belief in the \"vital agent\" Esdaile, however, was too thoroughly grounded in his own experiences at first ever to rest his opinions on the authority of others, and what he gives us are his own experiences, and his own deductions from them. His experiences forced him to adopt the fluid theory as the only possible explanation of the effects produced by his method; but he did not investigate the psychic, and what might perhaps be called the cosmic aspects of Animal Magnetism. He did not deny the power of mind, or the purely psychic method, to cure disease; but, as he did not employ it, he does not theorise about it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile's approach to Animal Magnetism may differ from modern hypnotists, but his works and experiences prove his dedication to investigating the phenomena of nature. As such, we cannot dismiss the insights he offers regarding the effects of the \"vital agent\" or the importance of careful observation and open-mindedness in the pursuit of scientific knowledge."
