  "title": "\"The Power of Passes: Magnetism and Animal Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the positive effects of the passes-method on animals as described by Dr. Ennemoser and the recent experiments by Volgyesi. It emphasizes the non-rational and pre-verbal nature of passes, encouraging the reader to abandon rationalism and enter a mindset conducive to the power of magnetism. The text also notes how passes can change our boundary perception, allowing for a deeper connection with ourselves and the world around us.",
  "content": "However, if you let your mind to enter, in a non-rational way, in the world of magnetism, giving to your inner mind the chance to deploy all its power, you are supposed to have even more striking effects. Let us to examine some elements: 1. Passes operate on a non rational and pre-verbal level It means that while we are using passes we are communicating in a deeper level which go beyond words. It is our irrationalism that will give sense to them. Therefore, refuse to be to rational using them. Don’t think that a pass can have only one meaning or that only certain passes can solve certain problems. Passes are not words ; they are “directions”, instead. 2. Passes change our boundary perception An important element for getting to our primal state where healing is possible is being able to go beyond the division between “internal” and “external”. Despite the fact that passes are external, they create internal feeling. They are not exclusively done directly toward the body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by allowing our mind to enter the non-rational world of magnetism and embracing the power of passes, we can communicate at a deeper level beyond words, change our boundary perceptions, and speak to our primal mind in a physical way. By understanding these elements and using passes as \"directions,\" we can activate our enteric brain and unlock the healing potential within ourselves."
