  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about de Puysegur's vegeto-magnetic process and his emphasis on the importance of the air in aiding the magnetic process. This final part delves into de Puysegur's immense collection of writings on mesmerism and its medical aspects. He achieved notable success in alleviating suffering through mesmerism, and his research on the clairvoyant and prophetic faculties of mesmeric patients was unparalleled. Of particular interest was the inexplicable ability of somnambulant patients to perceive the sufferings of others and recommend remedies for their cure. The text also provides practical tips for magnetists, including breathing exercises to improve their results.",
  "content": "No recent writings on mesmerism in its medical aspect have an equal value with these, for de Puysegur, working with straightforward and earnest faith in his own power of alleviating suffering with the help of Mesmerism, attained brilliant successes, and above all — for later students of the subject — has done unrivaled service in investigating the prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients, not only in reference to their own but in respect also of other persons' ailments. On this development of their powers he says: “Of all the facts of magnetism the most inexplicable, and above all the least conceivable, is, without doubt, that of the vision possessed by patients in a perfect state of somnambulism in reference to the sufferings of others and the knowledge which they show of the remedies and measures necessary for their cure. . . . Anyhow, although there is no known phenomena (in other branches of science) to which one can compare the faculty — the fact is nevertheless real, as certain as the other manifestations of somnambulism already recognized.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, de Puysegur's work on mesmerism, particularly on investigating the prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients, has been invaluable to later students of the subject. His successes in achieving remarkable results and his careful study of various cases in his time serve as important examples of the potential of mesmeric healing."
