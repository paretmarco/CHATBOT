  "title": "\"Therapy Session: Finding Inner Strength and Truth\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the therapist guides the client towards a state of being where they feel power, strength, and truth within themselves, allowing them to absorb and transcend the fear and identities that previously held them back. However, the client expresses concern about how to integrate this state while living in the world, highlighting the challenges of transitioning from a no-state state to everyday life. This represents one of the most difficult points in therapy, as the client must learn to balance their newfound sense of being with their practical responsibilities.",
  "content": "Client: To know the truth. Therapist: Good, now from \"back there\", in the empty-space, feel the power, strength and truth of being. Client: Okay. Therapist: How does that feel? Client: Clear. Therapist: Now look at these two I-dentities and the fear that connects them and see if you can allow them to \"turn around\" and see that what they are seeking is inside you. Client: They can see that. Therapist: Now allow them to be absorbed as you feel the strength, power, and truth. Client: Okay. Therapist: How is that? Client: Good, but from back here I don't feel like doing anything. How do I live with my wife and keep this space, while living in the world? Therapeutic Note Here we are facing one of the most difficult points in r 222 â€¢ THE TAO OF CHAOS therapy. The no-state state is so different and new, that the integration of living life from \"back there\" is very hard to understand. Why? Because from \"back there\" you just are, and your actions are not figured out or calculated through a rational thought process.",
  "last_phrase": "In the process of transitioning to a state of being where your actions come from a place of no internal consideration, it can be challenging to integrate this perspective into your daily life. To aid in this process, the Sufi exercise of self-remembering, recommended by G.I. Gurdjieff, may be helpful. Remember, before enlightenment and after, the actions remain the same, but the subjective experience is entirely different."
