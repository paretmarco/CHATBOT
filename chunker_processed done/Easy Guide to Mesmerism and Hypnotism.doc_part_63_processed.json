  "title": "Understanding Animal Magnetism and the Use of Hypnotism",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the peculiar physiological condition of hypnotism and how it is not caused by any occult force but rather the perverted action of certain parts of the cerebral nervous organs. While the medical profession is rightly cautious of its use in the treatment of disease, in the hands of skilled individuals, hypnotism can be used to relieve pain and remedy disease. The text also explores different terms used to describe peculiar nervous conditions, including Animal Magnetism, Mesmerism, and Hypnotism.",
  "content": "Nervous persons may be seriously injured by being subjected to such experiments, more especially if they undergo them repeatedly; and it should be illegal, to have public exhibitions of the kind alluded to. The medical professions has always been rightly jealous of the employment of hypnotism in the treatment of disease, both from fear of the effect of such operations on the nervous systems of excitable people, and because such practice is in the border land of quackery and of imposture. Still in the hands of skilful men there is no reason why the proper employment of a method influencing the nervous system so powerfully as hypnotism should not be the means of relieving pain or remedying disease. ANIMAL MAGNETISM The terms Animal Magnetism, Electro-Biology, Mesmerism, Clairvoyance, Odylic, or Odic force and Hypnotism, have been used to designate peculiar nervous conditions in which the body and mind of an individual, were supposed to be Influenced by a Mysterious force emanating from another person. With the exception of Mesmerism, a name given to the phenomena in honour of one of their earliest investigators, F. A. Mesmer, each of these terms implies a theory.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnotism and other forms of nervous conditions should be employed with caution and only by skilled practitioners. While it may have the potential to relieve pain or remedy disease, it can also be dangerous in the hands of untrained individuals. Animal magnetism, electro-biology, clairvoyance, and odylic force are all theories that attempt to explain the mysterious forces behind these phenomena. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember the potential risks associated with these practices, especially if they are repeatedly performed on an excitable person. It should also be illegal to have public exhibitions of such practices, as they are on the borderland of quackery and imposture."
