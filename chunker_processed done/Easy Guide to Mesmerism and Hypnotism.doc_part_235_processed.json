  "title": "\"Phreno-Mesmerism: The Power of Direct Brain Stimulation\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the correlation between phrenology and mesmerism in inducing a mesmeric state. The author highlights that some individuals are more susceptible to mesmeric influence based on their temperament, and the phreno-mesmeric process can stimulate certain organs into activity. While some doubts the possibility of such operations, the author argues that phreno-mesmeric processes are superior to mechanical automatic suggestion. Thus, this final section sheds more light on the concept of phreno-mesmeric phenomena, which has been a subject of controversy among experimentalists.",
  "content": "Again, the first mentioned are, perhaps, the most difficult subjects to reduce to sleep; but when fully under influence, they make the best possible subjects for all forms of mental or psychological phenomena—thought-reading, thought-transference, psychometry, and phreno-mesmeiism, etc. In the mesmeric state, under the peculiar nervous conditions induced by it, the whole brain, especially that of animal life and sense, is in a dorman or benumbed state. The somnambulistic state is often brought about by partial demesmerisation, as in semi waking and sleeping dreams. By this phreno-mesmeric process, certain organs are stimulated into activity—and a direction, a positive direction under the control of the mesmerist, given to the thoughts and actions of the sensitive. Some doubt the possibility of such operations, yet admit the probability of the foregoing easperiments of Charcot, based on automatic inhibition,—mechanical automatic suggestion, if you will. The greater includes the less. Phreno-mesmeric processes, antedate Charcot's suggestions, and are superior to them. The former produce results, when the latter inevitably fails.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, phreno-mesmeric processes offer direct communication with the brain and produce impressive results, while Charcot's mechanical automatic suggestions are indirect and often fail. By putting the subject into a deep unconscious sleep and stimulating the organ of the faculty desired to be aroused, consciousness can be restored, and the mind can be directed to achieve positive outcomes. With patience and practice, phreno-mesmeric processes can unlock remarkable psychological phenomena in sensitive individuals."
