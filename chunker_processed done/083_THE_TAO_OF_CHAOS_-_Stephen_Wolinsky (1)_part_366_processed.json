  "title": "\"The Importance of Compassion and the Pitfalls of Judgement\"",
  "first_phrase": "Compassion, as a quality of Essence, is often overlooked due to our psychological and emotional defenses, preventing us from truly connecting with others. In this final section, we explore the hindrances that keep us from embodying compassion and connecting with our Real Self. We delve into the concept of judgment, both towards ourselves and others, and its potential impact on our ability to connect and cultivate compassion. These insights will be explored in greater depth in my upcoming book, The Way of the Human.",
  "content": "In other words, in an attempt to \"act compassionate\" we are concerned with how we look to another, and there is a subtle sense of I am better than they are. This often occurs because we imagine that people create their intrapsychic problem or physical illness. In actuality, it could have happened to anyone; \"There but for the grace of the emptiness goes the I.\" Let us now explore the ways that prevent us from knowing the body felt compassion of The Essence of our Real Self Judgement Most forms of psychology and spirituality would say that judgement of another or oneself is something to be gotten rid of, or certainly something you should stop doing. I had a girlfriend in college who broke up with me. In my pain I continued calling her, wanting her back. She said, \"You should judge less and understand more.\" This lofty statement, although it was a nice cliche' was judgmental in itself. After all, I should be better than I was if I judged her less for leaving me and understood her position. The problem here was that I was suffering and wanted her back.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly embody compassion, we must let go of our tendency to judge ourselves and others. When we recognize that intrapsychic problems and physical illnesses can happen to anyone, and that our judgments are just a way of resisting our own experiences, we can begin to cultivate a deeper sense of understanding and empathy towards ourselves and others. As we move forward with this awareness, we can commit to practicing self-compassion and extending compassion towards those around us."
