  "content": "As many of our students come from abroad, after you make your booking we will give you a link to some books in order to begin to better understand and start practising by yourself. Bibliography My direct introductions to the ancient techniques of Magnetism pushed me to read the most about it and search more. I read almost all the books published on this topic. The majority of the most important books about it are not in English. One of the reasons is that until 1920, English was not as important as it is today, and the main languages were French and German. Interesting Books about Magnetism and Mesmerism in French Firstly, the works of Mesmer itself. His book “Mesmerismus” gives an in-depth explanation of his technique. We plan to translate it into English as soon as possible. It is very important to understand that Mesmer adhered to a Masonic Lodge and used a kind of Masonic language throughout all of his work. Masonic Language is symbolic. To understand what symbolic means, we could say that a word has a meaning at a different level of reality.",
  "last_phrase": "To our international students, we offer a link to helpful books for practicing ancient Magnetism techniques. While much of the important literature is only available in French and German, understanding symbolic language can aid in comprehension. We recommend works by Mesmer and the Durvilles for a deeper understanding of this fascinating subject."
