  "title": "Exploring the Existence of Magnetic Fluid, NLP, and Mesmerism",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of the \"magnetic fluid\" was discussed, which is something that some people believe doesn't exist because it cannot be measured using traditional mechanical devices. However, we create our ideas of reality based on our senses, and sometimes things that exist outside of our perception leave only their traces. This leads to a query about whether what we call fluid is something that cannot be expressed in a naturalistic way. In this last section, we will compare the popular technique Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) with Mesmerismus and see if either method can address these questions.",
  "content": "In the same way, we don’t see the fluid if we try to measure it, but this doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Sometimes we think to perceive it with our senses, but in reality things are like after a flood, when we see traces of the water on the ground, like for example destroyed or moved buildings. We are not seeing the flood itself. The flood itself is done by and with water. We are only seeing its traces. In the same way we could think that we can sometimes see traces with our senses of what in reality is not perceivable directly in this way. It just means that our way of measuring it with mechanic devices doesn’t work for determining it. Maybe what we call fluid is something that cannot be expressed in a naturalistic way. Comparison between Mesmerismus and NLP A technique that is much diffused nowadays is NLP. NLP or Neuro-Linguistic Programming is based on an approach where the words we use shape our reality. Moreover, NLP is based on a paradigm founded on sensory perception. It is our experience that NLP training is useful to understand certain elements, but in this model some elements are lacking.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while we may not be able to perceive certain things directly with our senses or through mechanical devices, they may still exist and be perceived through other means. Mesmerism and yoga techniques offer alternative approaches to NLP, which may enhance its effectiveness by taking a more holistic approach that considers both the operator and their strategy."
