  "title": "\"Self-Remembering: Sufi Exercise for Integration and Self-Awareness\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section delves into a therapist's recommendation of the Sufi exercise of self-remembering to aid in a client's transition phase. The client struggles with dividing their attention between their subjective experience and the present moment. The therapist suggests a breathing exercise to help with this, emphasizing its importance as homework for the client. The text quotes from \"In Search of the Miraculous\" by P.D. Ouspensky and highlights the significance of directing attention towards oneself without weakening it on something else.",
  "content": "Therapeutic Note This is a difficult task, and a \"higher\" level of experience than he can do, so I offered him something he could do for homework. Therapist: Okay, see if on your inhale you can take all your attention and keep it \"back there,\" and on your exhale, put all your attention \"out here.\" Client: You mean oscillate back and forth with my breathing? Therapist: Yes. Client: I can do that. Therapist: Okay, try that this week for homework and let's see what happens. I► the observed phe- nomena when at the same time, I try to remember myself, my attention, is directed toward the object observed and toward myself. A second arrowhead appears on the line: I •► the observed phenomena having defined this I saw that the problem consisted in directing attention on oneself without weakening or obliterating the attention directed on something else.\" (In Search of the Miraculous, P. D. Ouspensky, Harcour, Brace & World, Inc., 1949, p. 119) ________________ Conclusion Here the homework is of vital importance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, offering do-able exercises as homework is crucial for reinforcing the integration process and empowering clients to develop self-awareness on their own. This enables clients to progress without constant guidance from their therapists, and ultimately helps them stay in a space of mindfulness and self-reflection throughout their daily lives."
