  "title": "\"The Three Principles of the Universal Light\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the three principles necessary for everything that exists are described as Sulphur F, Mercury, and Salt. The essence of Mercury, which is centripetal and universally penetrating, is compared to the way in which metal infiltrates organic bodies. It is the animating force of all things and takes the name of Azoth in its active form. The Azoth is considered the beginning and end of creation, a divine Breath that has existed since the beginning of time. It is through this substance that the redeeming Light is born.",
  "content": "From this concept, Salt is born, the third aspect of the Light that fills the Universe, leaving no space for the negative shadows, that correspond to an inconceivable Nothing. Sulphur F, Mercury and Salt are the three principles that the Sages consider to be uniquely and absolutely necessary in everything that exists, because it is impossible to imagine anything that does not have its own substance, its limiting sphere (Salt ), that is subject simultaneously to internal influences (Sulphur F) and external influences (Mercury ). Considered in its universal form as the etheric dynamism that is the animating force of all things, Mercury in its active form takes the name Azoth of the Sages. Its symbol then becomes slightly modified: the passive half moon that crowns the symbol gives way to the zodiacal sign of the ram . We are tempted to say that everything, in its origins, resides in that Azoth, the beginning and end of creation. It is the divine Breath (Ruach Elohim) that floats above the saline waters since the beginning of time and for all eternity. It is He who was made flesh inside the virginal substance so that the redeeming Light could be born.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the three principles - Sulphur F, Mercury, and Salt - emphasizes the necessity of substance, internal and external influences, and a limiting sphere. The Azoth of the Sages, born of Mercury, Sulphur, and purified Salt, represents the animating force of all things and the beginning and end of creation. Through initiation and purification, one may catch a glimpse of the divine Light, which illuminates the conscience and guides the will, but it cannot be bestowed through any ceremonial."
