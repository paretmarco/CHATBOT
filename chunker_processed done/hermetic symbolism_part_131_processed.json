  "title": "\"The Chamber of Reflection: Alchemical Rituals and Symbolism\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the alchemical concept of reducing a chosen material to its essence and the process of the recipient being stripped of their artificialities within the Chamber of Reflection. The subject is closed off from all outside light and put through a symbolic death to pave the way for the birth of the new self. Within the chamber, two containers of Salt and Sulphur are present as a practical necessity to isolate the recipient. Through this isolation, one can become absorbed in themselves and discover the core of their individuality.",
  "content": "It would be impossible to answer without referring to the theory of the three alchemical bases: Sulphur, Mercury and Salt. Sulphur effectively corresponds to the expansive energy that originates in the centre of every being (Column J, red, individual drive). Its action is opposed to that of Mercury, which infiltrates everything by way of an influence of external origin (Column B, white, receptivity, sensibility). These two antagonistic forces are balanced in Salt, the base for crystallisation, that represents the stable part of the being in which condensation takes effect, in that area where the sulphurous emissions escape the external mercurial compression. The summary nature of these indications in no way reduce the justification for the ritual practices regarding Salt and Sulphur. The exclusion of Mercury is a practical necessity, because the Recipient must be totally isolated. In order to know himself, according to the Socratic principle Gnoti seauton, it is necessary to abstract from everything external with the aim of becoming absorbed in himself and eventually coming face to face with the core of his individuality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the alchemical theory of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt provides insights into the balance of opposing forces within every being. To truly know oneself, it is necessary to isolate oneself from external influences and delve into the core of individuality. This descent into the depths of the Earth, represented by the formula VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTIFICANDO INVENIES OCCULTUM LAPIDEM, leads to the discovery of the Hidden Stone, a fundamental Masonic symbol."
