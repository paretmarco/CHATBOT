  "title": "\"The Sybil’s Book: Exploring Tarot, Symbolism, and Prophecy\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we delved into the fascinating symbolism of the Sybil's temple, with Tritons blowing trumpets to whisper premonitions to sensitive souls. The Sybil's book is considered the book of occult sciences and contains mysteries that our intellect seeks to penetrate. In this final section, the author examines the painting's central figure: a woman clothed with the sun and a crown of twelve stars, inspired by the book of Apocalypse. This woman is in labor and being threatened by a great red dragon whose tail sweeps stars from the sky.",
  "content": "It begs recognition of the fact that they are inhabitants of that Ocean made up of the waters above the celestial firmament, represented by the roof of the temple. Their mission consists of whispering to the ears of sensitive souls the premonition of that which they are preparing to carry out. On the other hand, the trumpets are directed towards a ship that is bobbing on a stormy sea, whose sails appear to be filled with the wind of the Tritons’ breath. We will come back to this ship and its cargo, after indicating the meaning of the painting’s principal character. This time the painter must have taken his inspiration from the book of Apocalypse, which in Chapter XII reads as follows: “And a great sign appeared in the sky: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon beneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. “And she was with child, and she wailed aloud with pain as she laboured to give birth.” It then talks of a great red dragon, whose tail sweeps some of the stars from the sky and casts them down to earth.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, the painting's principal character, the woman clothed with the sun, symbolizes the divine consciousness made flesh, emanating from the Lord our Father, the Universal Origin of Consciousness. The trumpets and the Tritons serve as messengers of premonition, while the great red dragon represents the ancient serpent, who deceives the whole world. Through this painting and its symbolism, one can reflect on the eternal themes of good versus evil and the triumph of light over darkness."
