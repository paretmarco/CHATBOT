  "title": "Understanding Enneagram Type 9 Laziness & Co-Dependency",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses how the pain of trauma can cause individuals to develop a state of unconscious laziness and a resistance to looking inside themselves. The strategy of fixating attention is employed to distract themselves and others from confronting their emptiness. Specifically, the author refers to the true chameleon of #9 who looks outside itself for existence and is called the Mediator or Peacemaker. The author also mentions the trances that occur psychologically and the organization of identities around Essence. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the trance of amnesia and negative hallucination experienced by #9. The text highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the underlying causes of psychic laziness and resistance to self-reflection.",
  "content": "In this particular strategy of fixating attention, the pain of trauma of moving from Essence to personality is so great that an unconscious laziness develops. In Trances People Live we discuss the trances that occur psychologically. Here the organization of I-dentities around Essence causes trances to defend against the pain after the loss of Essence. This uncon- sciousness takes the form of psychic laziness and a resistance to looking inside of oneself. For this reason, the underlying state is laziness, and the chief trance is called Going Along With the Stream by Naranjo. Actually, the strategy of fixating attention is because the observer/personality dyad sees nothing inside themselves and instead of giving into it, wants to go unconscious about it. This produces laziness or sloth. Furthermore, it produces a basic style of giving oneself up for others. For example, the true chameleon of #9 feels as though there is nothing inside. Rather than acknowledging that, #9 looks outside itself for its existence and is called the Mediator by Palmer or the Peacemaker by Riso. It must be understood that the unconscious laziness of #9 and going along with the stream is a way of distracting themselves and others from confronting their emptiness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the underlying state of laziness and the chief trance of going along with the stream is crucial for those who identify with the Enneagram type 9. By acknowledging and confronting their emptiness, they can avoid co-dependency and develop a true sense of identity that is not reliant on others. By doing so, they can achieve their highest aim of love and discover a fulfilling sense of self."
