  "title": "\"The Tragic Romantic: Understanding Love, Pain, and Masochism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author describes how the personality tries to fill up the void of love and emptiness caused by the failure of the love object to satisfy the infant's needs. This leads to the tragic romantic fixation strategy of associating pain with love as the observer/personality dyad fuses the two ideas. In the last part, the author draws on psychoanalytic theory to explain the development of the masochistic metaphor during the anal phase of child development. The author highlights the illusion of power and control the child believes it has by withholding, leading to an association between pain and control.",
  "content": "This comes about because the personality first tries to fill up the emptiness with a love object, which fails. The love object, which is often the parent, cannot fill up the emptiness of the infant so there is pain. The observer/ personality dyad then fuses or associates the idea of love with the idea of pain, i.e., love = pain. Hence this is called the tragic romantic by Palmer. The decision to try to fill up and defend oneself from feeling the emptiness becomes a fixation strategy of the observer/personality dyad by using pain, which to the #4 fixation strategy equals the love of Essence. In the psychoanalytic literature, the metaphor of the masochist develops during the anal phase of development. The child is being toilet trained. When the child moves its bowels, Mom/Dad are happy. When the child withholds, Mom/ Dad are not happy. In this case there is an illusion of power and control on the part of the child. The child can withhold, and by doing so imagines it can control the happiness of its Mother or Father, even at the cost of discomfort. The child spites the parent by holding back, and believes it is control- ling Mom's/Dad's happiness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the development of masochism in early childhood and how it becomes a fixation strategy for the personality can help individuals identify and work through their tendencies to withhold and control through pain. By recognizing this pattern and the distorted illusion of power it creates, individuals can begin to let go of envy and focus on their own personal growth and self-love.
