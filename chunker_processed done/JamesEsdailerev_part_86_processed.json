  "title": "The Mesmeric Action: Esdaile's Cautionary Tales and Observations.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses mesmerism and its effects on the nervous system. He argues that mesmerising can induce a diseased action in the nervous system that mimics constitutional laws that are still unknown to us. In this last part, the author refers to Esdaile, who was very careful in avoiding mental effects of mesmerism since they could interfere with his physical effects. Esdaile made sure to exclude possible sources of fallacy, such as habit, training, and imagination, by only sharing the results of his first experiments on different subjects. The author suggests that, unlike his brother mesmerists, Esdaile conducted his experiments with a dove-like simplicity, taking the most common precautions to ensure accurate results.",
  "content": "But a dove-like simplicity seems to be considered the badge of all our tribe, and no mesmerist gets credit for having sufficient common sense to take the most common precautions in making his experiments.\" In drawing conclusions from his experiences, he put aside everything that might be the result of habit or training:- \"All practical mesmerists know how the specific mesmeric symptoms become complicated with the effects of the imagination and unconscious volition when highly-sensitive subjects are frequently experimented upon. To guard against this source of fallacy, I shall only relate the results of first experiments made upon different subjects.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Esdaile's thorough and cautious approach to mesmerism serves as an important reminder for modern hypnotists to conduct their experiments responsibly and take into account the potential consequences of their actions. Maintaining a balance between using mesmerism as a remedy and avoiding the development of a \"mesmeric disease\" is key to producing accurate results and avoiding misunderstandings within the general population."
