  "title": "\"Alchemy: Symbolism and Philosophy of Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Light as the single and identical essence that every living being originates from, regardless of their size. Alchemical Ternary consisting of Sulphur, Salt and Mercury, represents the tri-unity of light in different forms. Salt acts as the receptacle of substance resisting external compression, while Sulphur and Mercury represent interior and exterior light, respectively. The primary materials of alchemy, Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, can each be interpreted in relation to the others. The text concludes by discussing the symbol of a wholly purified soul, associated with the Achievement of the Great Work, which is represented by the figure of the Hanged Man in the Tarot.",
  "content": "Sulphur Salt Mercury Arca Beginning Spirit Internal Contained Expansion Centrifugal movement Leaving Hyle Substance Body Medial Container Neutrality Stability, repose Staying Azoth Word Soul fire External Surrounding Compression Centripetal movement Entering If the symbol for Sulphur ()is the symbol of a constructive Fire, locked away inside the seed that must germinate, then by inverting it we obtain the symbol of a Water that has undergone the whole series of purifying distillations, and whose distinctive qualities have therefore been sublimated to the extreme. From the point of view of the Adept, it is a wholly purified soul, fortified by the tests of existence, which has reached a state of saintliness that allows it to work miracles. It is conceivable, under these conditions, that the symbol with which we are concerned, in hermeticism, was associated with the Achievement of the Great Work . In the Tarot, this is represented by the figure of the Hanged Man (Arcanum XII) in the same way in which the figure of the Emperor (Arcanum IV) is linked with the Plutonic symbol of Sulphur .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbol for Sulphur and its inversion hold significant meaning in hermeticism and the achievement of the Great Work. The perfectly balanced individual represented by the Cubic Stone should be the artist's ideal phase of work, as well as the Companion phase for the Masons. Attaining neutrality and stability within oneself is crucial to truly transform into a faultless cube, attuned to all the demands of the spirit."
