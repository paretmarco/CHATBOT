  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we discussed the process of hypnotizing someone using an anchor word and a physical action. In this concluding section, we will focus on how to bring the subject out of the hypnotic state. It's important to ensure a smooth and safe transition back to reality. Counting from 1 to 10 is one effective way to terminate the trance. We also need to emphasize to the subject that they will be completely out of trance and wide awake when we reach the number 5 to avoid any potential risks. Let's explore the proper technique for trance termination to ensure a successful hypnosis session.",
  "content": "The reawakening is much more simple than with a somnambulistic trance Tell the subject: “In a moment I will count from 1 to 10 at which time your eyes will open, you will be completely out of trance and wide awake, feeling fully refreshed and much better than before” (count slowly giving your subject the time he/she needs to return to a conscious state.) “one – feeling a wave of energy moving through your body … two – every part of your body feeling more alive and energized … three – reorienting to this room completely now … four – bringing a sense of wellbeing within you … five – eyes open … fully present in this room … feeling better than before” Please remember to give the subject not only the suggestion that (s)he will be wide awake, but also that (s)he will be completely out of trance when you will reach the number 5. It has been reported that some subjects, who were officially “woken up” after a session at their therapist’s, truly got out of trance while driving home.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to be aware of the potential pitfalls of subconscious mind language when giving suggestions during hypnosis. To ensure a successful reawakening, always give clear and specific commands that avoid any misinterpretation. Remember to use the recommended phrase to bring your subject out of trance and back to a conscious state in a safe and controlled manner."
