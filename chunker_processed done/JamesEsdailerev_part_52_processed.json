  "first_phrase": "In this final chapter, we delve deeper into the fascinating work of de Puysegur, a trailblazer in the field of mesmerism. The patients connected to a tree, while some experienced the 'ordinary crisis,' followed by a sleep state that enabled the expansion of mental faculties. Puysegur's writing extensively documents his experiences with clairvoyant persons and their illnesses, which prove useful for later students of the subject. The chapter emphasizes the power of mesmeric patients in prophesizing and clairvoyance, where they showcase knowledge and remedies for cure.",
  "content": "Healing through enlargement of faculties The whole collection of Puysegur’s writings embodies an immense accumulation of experiences with clairvoyant persons during illness in respect to their own maladies. No recent writings on mesmerism in its medical aspect have an equal value with these, for de Puysegur, working with straightforward and earnest faith in his own power of alleviating suffering with the help of Mesmerism, attained brilliant successes, and above all — for later students of the subject — has done unrivaled service in investigating the prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients, not only in reference to their own but in respect also of other persons' ailments. On this development of their powers he says: “Of all the facts of magnetism the most inexplicable, and above all the least conceivable, is, without doubt, that of the vision possessed by patients in a perfect state of somnambulism in reference to the sufferings of others and the knowledge which they show of the remedies and measures necessary for their cure. . . . Anyhow, although there is no known phenomena (in other branches of science) to which one can compare the faculty — the fact is nevertheless real, as certain as the other manifestations of somnambulism already recognized.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, de Puysegur's work on mesmerism and clairvoyance of patients during illness has contributed immensely to the field of medicine. His investigations into the prophetic and clairvoyant faculties of mesmeric patients have not only shed light on the patients' own maladies but also on those of others. These findings have undoubtedly paved the way for further studies on artificial somnambulism and its potential to alleviate suffering in patients."
