  "title": "\"The Power of Fascination: Di Pisa's Hypnotic Ability\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we have read about the power of Prof. Di Pisa's gaze and his ability to identify the subjects who respond to it instantly. In the last 200 tokens, we see examples of how he used this power in everyday life. He froze a subject in the middle of the road, hypnotized a passerby with his finger and even caused a waiter to enter an automatic state. These incidents shed light on the immense control he wielded over others through the sheer power of his gaze.",
  "content": "One day, while in Piazza Cairoli, he pointed his index finger at an approaching passer-by chosen at random, whereupon he started issuing him such injunctions as, ‘Go there’ and ‘Turn that way’. The passer-by promptly carried out the said instructions in a hypnotic state, without realizing what was going on. When Di Pisa finally woke him up from that state, the person concerned no longer knew where he was. Di Pisa, in fact, did not limit his self to using fascination with a high level of mastery within the four walls of his study, but did so in everyday life as well. There was a time when he invited a friend of his to a cafeteria. Purely by his look, he plunged the waiter into a state of fascination which caused him to delve into an automatic state.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Di Pisa's mastery of hypnosis was not limited to his study but extended to his everyday life, as evidenced by his ability to hypnotize strangers and even waiters in cafes. His abilities demonstrate the powerful and sometimes unexpected effects of suggestion and fascination, and serve as a reminder to be aware of one's own susceptibility to such influences."
