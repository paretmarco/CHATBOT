  "content": "Working on this pole and at the same time on the black pole is very healthy. 5. The fifth pole goes from the nose until the top of the head, and from the nose until the upper lip. It also includes the ears. We work on this pole when we have mental problems or we want to heighten the spirit. 6. The sixth pole is the eye pole. Its action connects with the same pole in the magnetisee. To get results, the right eye must look at the left eye in both the operator and the subject. This pole is very strong between people of a different sex to enhance energy and to boost the tone. 7. The seventh pole is the hands pole and can combine with the others in order to create the equators. It is the easiest one to use. To use it you must join the two index fingers one toward the other and in the middle the part you want to magnetize. You will get there the same warmth that you get on the black pole when you are well magnetized.",
