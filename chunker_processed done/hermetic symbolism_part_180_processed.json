  "title": "Symbolism and Mysticism in Saint Maurice Painting",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text spoke about the duality between passion and spirituality, as represented in the painting of Saint Maurice. In the last 200 tokens, the focus shifts to the sphere of gnosis and the temple of spiritual illumination, symbolized by the Virgin Mary. The circular temple is adorned with four symbols of the elements, united by a rooster dedicated to Mercury. This signifies the dawn of a new day within all souls.",
  "content": "The left hand side is dedicated to theory, to the contemplation by way of which the Adept conquers the secrets of a Wisdom that is of great value for its own sake41. In this sense, this work is linked to the dry or rational path, never straying from the firm ground, whose solidity offers the basis for transcendent positivity. * * * For the moment, let us focus on the sphere of gnosis or of spiritual illumination, whose temple the Virgin lifts up to us. This circular building has four visible windows, each with one of the symbols of the four elements in its frame: the scythe of Saturn (Earth), the trident of Neptune (Water), the thunderbolt of Jupiter (Fire) and the winged staff of Mercury (Air). But this quaternary is united by the rooster that sits atop the dome of the temple. This bird, dedicated to Mercury as the god of subtlety and intelligence, announces the dawn of the day that must break within all souls.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the sphere of gnosis or spiritual illumination presented in this text encourages us to go beyond the rational path and contemplate the mysteries of Wisdom. The temple of the Virgin and its symbols, including the rooster, plumbline, and character dressed in red, offer a profound invitation to withdraw within ourselves and awaken to the internal light that illuminates us all."
