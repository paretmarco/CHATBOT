  "title": "\"Magnetic Healing and Mesmerism: Puysegur's Experiments and Discoveries\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the success of magnetism in inducing a stable state, leading to healing of patients, as noted by Puysegur. In this concluding section, we see how the news of his success spread and he was inundated by patients. As he found it difficult to attend to all of them, he adopted Mesmer's technique of magnetizing an elm to treat them. The section also mentions the successful exertion of magnetic influence from a distance in mesmerism, highlighting the concept of \"quantum entanglement\" between operator and subject.",
  "content": "In reality all the records pertaining to mesmerism, both early and recent, teem with illustrations of the way in which magnetic influence from a distance has been successfully exerted upon persons who were quite unprepared to expect it. This concept also teams up with the idea we have presented at the beginning of this book regarding a form of “quantum entanglement” between operator and subject taking effect. The news of his cure was rapidly spread abroad, and from all sides there was a concourse of sick people demanding relief. The phenomena were repeated, to Puysegur's great joy, and he wrote: \"My head is turned with joy, now that I see what good I am doing.\" What we learn from Puysegur: with magnetism it is possible to induce a stable state. In this state healing can occur. Similar states of stability can also come about when working with magnetism on animals. They are more stable on the ground, and they let themselves go after few passes. Since he was unable to minister to the continually increasing number of patients, the marquis pursued Mesmer's plan of magnetizing an elm which grew on the village green at Buzancy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Puysegur's success with magnetism in inducing a stable state for healing provides evidence of the potential for magnetic influence from a distance. Additionally, his attention to nature and the importance of air in the magnetic process shows us the significance of understanding and utilizing all resources available to us in alternative forms of healing. By following these practices, we may open up new possibilities in the field of medical treatment."
