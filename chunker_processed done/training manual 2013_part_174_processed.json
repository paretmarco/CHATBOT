  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author delves deeper into the benefits of the exercise explained earlier, cautioning against overdoing it due to its powerful effects. The exercise activates the nervous system and emits magnetic circles from the soul, leading to tranquility and opening realms of joy. They advise releasing the hands from the chair and stopping the exercise if the body shows signs of strain. Gradually, it will lead to higher consciousness, and understanding the true nature of the world, such as the sun being only for planetary sustenance and our planet being a light unto itself.",
  "content": "It will not do to over-exercise if you are to develop all your brain functions equally. The curing qualities of this exercise must be experienced instead of explained. Gradually you will be led higher and higher into realms of consciousness, and wisdom will unfold unto you daily. Things you were unable to comprehend before begin to appear very simple. In fact, there will be nothing you cannot grasp and understand, and then you will comprehend that even the light which you thought comes from the sun is but the light of our own planet. You will understand that your senses in their deluded condition of yet undeveloped brain functions have miscomprehended the works divine, and that the sun is neither a fire ball, nor has it any more light than necessary for the sustenance of its own planetary conditions. You will understand that our planet is a light unto itself, and that \"I am the light of the world.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by gradually developing your brain functions through the right exercise, you will experience a higher level of consciousness and wisdom. You will comprehend the world around you in a new light and be captivated by the inner power within you. So, take a deep breath, forget all language, and uncover this enchanting power for yourself."
