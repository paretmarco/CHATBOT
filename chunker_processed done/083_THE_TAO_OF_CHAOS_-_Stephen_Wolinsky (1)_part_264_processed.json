  "title": "Understanding Schemas: Cognitive Patterns and Therapeutic Techniques",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about schemas and how they shape our cognition. Now, we dive into a therapy session where a therapist unveils the possibility that the client's younger schema could be viewing their mother instead of their wife. The therapist asks the client to connect with their mother I-dentity and little boy I-dentity to better understand their fear and desire for security and power. The session ends with a visualization exercise where the client feels fantastic.",
  "content": "Therapist: What feeling connects the mother identity to the little boy I-dentity? Client: Fear. Therapist: Feel the fear, be it completely, as energy. Client: Okay. Therapist: Good, from \"back there,\" ask the mother I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: To be taken care of. Therapist: And if she was taken care of, what would she feel? Client: Safe and loved. Therapist: Ask the little boy I-dentity, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Client: To be myself. Therapist: And if you felt like yourself, what would that feel like? Client: Strong and powerful. Therapist: Good, now, from \"back there,\" feel the love...safety of back there...along with the power and strength of back there. Client: Yes. Therapist: How are you doing? Client: Fantastic. Therapist: Good, now notice the size and shape of these Identities. Client: Okay. Therapist: Now de-label them and see them as energy. Client: Okay.",
  "last_phrase": "By seeing our identities and emotions as energy, we have the power to reabsorb them back into our essence and find a sense of power, safety, and love. This exercise can be helpful in understanding our deepest fears and desires and finding a sense of peace within ourselves."
