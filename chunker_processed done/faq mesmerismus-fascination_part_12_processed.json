  "title": "\"Understanding Mesmerism and Fascination: Eye Gaze and Animal Magnetism\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learn how mesmerism and animal magnetism can affect an individual's health and behavior. In the last 200 tokens, we delve into the techniques of fascination, particularly the hypnotic eye gaze, and its difference from mesmerism. Paret teaches that fascination is an instant hypnosis that uses eye gaze and symbolic hand gestures to establish a connection with the cerebellum. Fascination can be used to treat a wide range of behavioral challenges, just like mesmerism, including stress disorders, addiction, pain management, and more.",
  "content": "See “How do hands passes and gestures play?Is there a real force?” -Which is the difference between fascination and mesmerism? Mesmerism uses hand passes close to the body of a subject (magnetic touch) and fascination (hypnotic eye gaze) to establish a connection through magnetic energy that passes from the practitioner to the subject. Paret teaches that illness is the result of blockage of the energy of animal magnetism in a individual. In mesmerism the psychic gifts of telepathy and clairvoyance are bestowed as a result of working with the energy of animal magnetism. Fascination is a “open eyes instant hypnosis”. It uses eye gaze to establish a connection with the cerebellum and here they use the term serpentine brain. Eye gaze and symbolic hand gestures are used to get deeply into contact with and act upon the reality of the person. -What do we treat with mesmerism? Stress disorders, nicotine and drug dependency, gambling, addiction, pain management, depression, panic disorder, insomnia, motivation, chronic fatigue syndrome, and many other various behavioural challenges. Sometimes is even possible to work without knowing the problem -What do we treat with fascination?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mesmerism and fascination are techniques that work with animal magnetism, using hypnotic eye gaze and hand gestures to establish a connection with the subject's energy. Mesmerism can be used to treat a wide range of behavioral challenges and physical pain, while fascination can create instant hypnosis to get deeply into contact with the reality of the person. Both techniques can offer beneficial results, relying on the power of the cerebellum and the energy of animal magnetism."
