  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explains the state of trance people enter when they fail to keep their promises to themselves. The technical term for this is amnesia, and it relates to a subconscious desire that often drives people to repeat past behavior. Hypnotherapy can help people recognize this pattern of behavior, but ultimately, it is up to the individual to remain conscious and aware of their choices. In the final section, the author discusses the concept of \"reawakening,\" a higher state of consciousness where individuals are fully present and aware of reality. This is illustrated through a metaphor of a trip to a foreign country, as used by Ouspenski to describe the state of self-awareness.",
  "content": "Hypnotherapy might prove of some help in these cases, since we implement, in a controlled fashion, a trance which normally occurs in an uncontrolled form. Hypnotherapy is however a partial remedy: We must rather learn to be outside a trance in each and every moment of our life. Only then will reality appear to us to be more lively, whereupon we become capable of truly taking decisions. We usually let ourselves be “swallowed by the mental side”, that is, be dictated to by worries, thoughts, reflections and automatic responses. Yet there is a deeper basis out there. What we term “reawakening” is the highest degree of consciousness which man could reach. It is a state in which we perceive reality as it truly is. When Ouspenski intended to indicate the state in which man begins, at least to a small extent, to “remember himself”, he resorted to the simile of the way we feel in the course of a trip to a foreign country.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnotherapy can be a helpful tool for controlling trances, but ultimately, we must learn to be fully present in every moment of our lives to awaken to the true reality. Reawakening to our full potential can be a transformative journey towards greater consciousness, and taking the first step can begin the path to healing the problems of our spirit."
