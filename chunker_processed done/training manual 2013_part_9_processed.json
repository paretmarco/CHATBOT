Before that, we learned about the importance of working on breathing, muscles, and glands for vitality, and how the Caduceus symbol represents the two sides of an individual and the development of life force. To better understand the keys, we'll connect them to the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, and water, as different states of consciousness.

By using these keys, we can develop our personal power and energy necessary for magnetism and fascination. Remember that the vital fluid is a force, not a substance that can be measured or quantified."
