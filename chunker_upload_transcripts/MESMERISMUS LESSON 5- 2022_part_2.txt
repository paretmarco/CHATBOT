hello hello everybody Leah David and Catherine amaso uh Andrew McDonald's and I think the other people will arrive sooner and will join us I see the translation here is in French Spanish okay Master speak in English correct in this lesson yes for the party um you're gone Fabian um hello please if somebody has something to ask me I can ask anyone that want to ask me about from the former lessons okay yes you can just click and speak to me yeah hi Marco I had a question regarding um a like I have a client that that that is um alcoholic and um I know there's the the Campanelli method but it's like a lot more movement to to to to remember I was wondering if the ball of light would be possibly effective to be able to help them possibly um lift that need for for for alcohol okay I will answer to you uh how to to work with alcohol uh practically uh the system uh that you learn with Campanelli can help but I will teach you two or three elements that uh where I use it also by uh by the pizza that can add very good when you work with alcohol faster you can work on the sensation of wine as one is very similar to vinegar you can suggest that wine is vinegar this is something uh something very simple and something very effective and the pizza that reality was in the past height in the past problem with the dark color and with the hypnosis went out used this system another element that was used by the Pisa that I found find a very clever is to tell to the person that drink that he will sleep because the sleep and the sleeper you can help with today we will because of of sleep today and I will explain to you why sleep is going away from reality and people drink for going away for reality so suggesting to to drink is very very good is very very good and these are uh two suggestions that I can give you uh in order to work with our colleagues after you should apply also like um understand where they drink who are they doing and we'll we discuss it a little more even in the advanced when you will be in the advances we can speak of it if you are in the advanced is part of the we speak a lot about alcoholism but this is these are some good elements to start with okay do you think the ball of light is adequate or something like that or a ball of light is more for um Banks for neuromuscular attention for activating a parasympathetic States for sure the ball of light is good in any case it's good for everything but it is not specific for alcohol you can instead using light real light okay and sometimes help can you say what was that light the light light before beginning can sometimes help oh okay thank you okay okay good um I think that we can um go today to the the to the lesson of today there are there any any other questions have you practiced it Andrea okay Andrea you practice always some matter that practices Alexander every day Marco I work with hypnosis now yes take a take example from Andrea because if you want to become exceptional you must work a lot um if you have no clients for the moment work at least with yourself go in front of the mirror look at yourself practice the techniques I gave to you and because this will do your uh you will become more charismatic more liable in each lesson we do I give something that is also useful for your personal relationship and US self hypnosis for being more Russia or today we will also speak of presence so this is a lesson where we will speak a lot of it okay other person that wanted to tell me something I know the student I go in a moment on the lessons today and on the program of today I remind you also that we send a questioner the questioner that we send if you fill up educational we will review any case we can even answer to you if you have questions that you express in the question you can also I ask you to use the cows profit from the cows it means ask ask ask you are here it's true that you can uh also just look the reply or maybe you can take your time this is right we sometimes some people does you know like also because they want to take their time and we accept it we accept that the person can take six more one year two years he is free because of the house is online and it's up to you when apply when to see the replay and but if you want to go faster we appreciate also and it is something very very very good okay I am today I'm sure a moment the small site that we have and we will walk on presidents and also on summer uh Clinic that we that we have and we will do also a demonstration in some moment with the help of Mr Andrea cuarto okay fifth week okay excuse me it's not there I lost the right the right page come okay 50 week goal of your with it weak presence presence we will do an exercise that is called Lucy exercise which polarity we will rock on catalepsi local blockage and also not so important in reality we we will do in the next more in the next and also you have some exercise on the making your eyes stronger and working with your eyes faster I will speak a little about for instance I already introduced it in another lesson but presence is a key point if you want uh to increase magnetism presence is you that take more power presence can also be the basis of personal magnetism we can say that personal magnetism is what developed when you work with prisons what does it mean not to work with prisons I will do a form a first exercise with everybody and um and we can do even on them I put to the gallery aside and I will ask you to open Fabien kovalik David Alexander Jaime Lea Linda and the people that has the screen to open if they want to naturally to open their microphone just to open it just if you have a sound in your home don't do but if you have uh if you're sound or don't do but if you don't have sounds okay we begin with uh the people that opened the microphone uh you will just in a moment say something it's not important what you say you can say I am happy that to be here or the sky is blue this is not important you see what you the the concept the the words are not important we will look at another element in some moment Fabian yeah okay Andre lucila blue Liberace I see a tree out of my window Alexander Schmidt I'm looking out of my window and see the street I feel real present right now Leah uh staring at me okay Linda okay Linda hidega um I'm looking at the dark hello everyone okay and Jack if you want you can speak but you must open your microphone just if you don't have uh sounds okay you have okay I don't know what you guys are talking about no problem this is how you speak normally now I ask you just to be more present to your body just to feel more your body okay let's begin again Andrea Fabian Andre we will see yellow blue David I see a tree outside of my window Alexander Smith I'm happy to be here Jaime Garcia I feel a high level of presence Linda Hall Inda ulty my cat is staring at me hildega I listened to all you say azina hello everybody Jack hey guys how is everybody doing staying for instance means feeling your body and now just try to feel your body don't lean on the the don't lean on the on the chair stay straight vertical and listen to the sound of your voice Fabian is right David I see a tree outside my window Alexander I'm happy to be here Jaime I feel very present right now Linda Linda cat is still staring at me Hildegard I'm listening to the difference inside here Athena um I'm happy to be here Jack a ladder is good today okay if you notice everybody changed it a lot just as Xena had some problems we see because she was a little worried we see and we listened also by her box I could speak about the difference even if Android kobalica told two times the the second time it was already different uh Leah and Linda were very very clear David and Alexander was very perceived you could perceive and Jack when you try to be more present you created your voice was a little different did you notice it this is a little basis of for instance you stay more in yourself you feel more and you see that your voice changes even without doing a specific exercise let's for example do another exercise fill up your lungs fill up fill up fill up fill up completely completely complete no no completely completely as you open the wings and after empty totally we repeat you must empty totally you must feel a little sensation in your height as me the eyes a little bigger and after foreign the sun has come out Alexander I'm happy to be here I met I feel a deep connected breathing presence now you are more present more better as voice Linda now Linda okay just a state present okay when you speak and your voice will change Leah I feel like I ran upstairs okay you I see that people change it Hildegard I'm listening still listening okay Jack leather is good outside okay and the other I don't ask because I don't want to to Katrina you arriving now there was a change invoice between the first and the other moment the last moment poor change it your voice was more present you were more you are more aware of your body now and this is something very important somebody made a comparison between being present and buying in a new country that you don't know and you are very present attentive in some way you are more open normally now you are more open you are more attentive and the voice that you did now is more the magnetic voice you should do when speaking with your client because your client will feel when you are inside yourself I will uh obviously you can say but I will lose this data I will lose presence I am now a little more present I feel more my body but probably in five minutes I will lose it sure I will teach you I already talked but I repeat two techniques that are very good to keep a presence the first one is keeping attention to one hand or one foot it means you know you have this handle all the fruit aware it means it's not necessary to touch the hand Alexander you just know you have your hand you understand you you have awareness this because you have a physical awareness we say that somebody we have a 50 000 tough every day are all useful probably not but for sure is a mist that block our mind that block our that clocks our minds so we can keep a part outside of the Mist apart in the reality this is the goal of keeping a hand or a foot we to keep aware of a kind or or of a food this is one of the main and simplest simple simplest exercise to be present you will begin to do this exercise and progressively you have a part of you that don't get clogged by doctor and the progressively the it's like when we do Progressive relaxation the presence can extend the toward the body is a worker that is simple but sometimes not easy because we forget it's very simple because we can explain it in two minutes but this is in some way is difficult because it is easy to forget it but the most important is remember to be present to come back told the ones if you have attention uh yeah if your attention is like as well and if you are in a combat and you lose your sword and go on the Earth what you do yulin and you take again your sword and you go you continue to do the combat it means the most important is taking away taking again this world because everybody will forget sometimes but after we create inevitude okay this way okay and so we keep ourselves more present you understand the concept this is very important so the first thing is keeping a hand or a foot obviously if you do some specific exercises you don't do you don't need to do because when I break like this I don't need to keep the hand because I'm already bringing a lot of attention myself but this will be something that I keep in the utter moments when I walking when I'm speaking when I'm doing my normal life and progressively we can think that now we had for example Jack aurazina we listened from the voice that they they were a little agitated we listened that they ever thought inside Jack because he said I don't know what you do it was a little worried and that's enough we because she had to worry about his child the her child that could disturb her but so we can think that these bottle people hide the sun sent off go inside and their voice showed it so they started for example from zero level of presence it's not zero but very low level of presence and they should speak if you uh have the attitude to have the handle of the of the or the footer you will not start from zero liver we will start from two in some way you will you will always be more present and progressively it will change a lot your life is is it clear presence is something that you must feel and I try with the exercise we do to make it feel and I see that even at the distance I could have people understand it when we do it in the classroom is even it's also very good because the people can help the other people because when we are present we have that but I see now that now is uh everybody is a lot of present uh against Fabiana I saw your Movement we see that naturally people when they are present they do less this movement this movement or this movement that are when we we think because when we have a subconscious thinking this will be perceived by the people around us and the presence is the basis for having a focus we must say that presents the basis of Charisma and when you have a lot of presence you will have even act if you practice yoga you can say but I understand that presence is not the basis of yoga because if you are not precious you don't do yoga yes even if now many people do yoga as a team but it's not a gym in reality is an answer in teaching about presence you understand why why it's faulty when we speak about uh because the most important is not the position but the awareness you have inside Mr Andre acuato and that is I don't know if you saw me but most of the time when I do this exercise happen right away today I go like in a crisis state but it's not bad it's a euphoric it's like a I don't know how we can explain it's like a tingling sensation that is it correct to get there or not uh yes yes or not it depends uh if you if you do go over it is something incorrect because probably you have something to work inside you but uh tingling sensation is correct because you change your vascular vascularization you have we can think that the Impressions we have also an activation of the parasympathetic system and so you will feel this tingling sensation you have a bottom have you the idea of kadu sales I will take we have all today the harmonica caduceus and I will show you the the any major that is very very good the aromatic sales has to uh has two branches and this uh two parenthesis like Canada for the two uh the two side of the the the right and the left side for people that doesn't know the aromatic caduceus I will take one image and it's a symbol that is used um a lot by I will put in the online course of today if I can modify it no I cannot modify here here yes thank you I will put an image I will show I will divide with you foreign here we have our online course and today we will speak correctly of the armentica Lucius and it's good to put as more caduceus here I can modify I think we put like this I wanted to show you that I was very able to put this this stuff but I could apply this is correct I put it like this wait a moment that we will see I will pass it here this is you see this um this uh hermeticado C is an answer ensemble dramatic caduce this is also the symbol of uh doctors if you see doctors physician they use this uh this kind of symbol and these two sides are like Ida and pingala in the uh in the Indian tradition and the two the two snakes connects in some points that are connected to the solar flexors to the different plexuses not just the solar plexus so we have a correspondency between hermetic adusi and the yoga tradition and we can even think that there is a correspondence within the right side and the left side as a sympathetic and parasympathetic branch of the nervous system and so we go to activate the bot when we activate both we have an energy a central energy that go on on the central world and we can arrive here up so we develop energy the symbol of the armentica Lucy is very clear we develop energy and the presence in some way developed this kind of energy because presidency will in some way change our way of feeling and you will feel things in sensation and after you can have also energy going up so it is good no when you walk a lot on presence mostly I should say with the exercises of the charges for example this exercise that I gave here and also as a matter you will feel naturally energy going up on your body that is already some kundalinic Sensation that can after being even increased foreign nice to see you all um my question is I noticed that some of the people who are not practicing anything who like even not aware about all this exercises techniques but they do have natural Charisma that they use what the differences between what we're doing and creating is like more conscious and they have like unconscious Charisma or what there is a faster you should see the people around you because sometimes some what we do here as you told is natural Charisma is a Charisma that you need to run an answer and sometimes some people also do something uh between uh something correct something called they do something correct I should see say that some people it's like in basketball we can have a people that is born that was born is very good to play basketball but even a person that is not born very high can learn and can do at their roles in the basketball so in some way everybody can play basketball so we can have some people that for some reason uh can be a little more present we can see that people that um in the past people should be more present because they were not too sure of anything they couldn't think too much because in reality life was very uncertain so we see for example in the past Germanic churches if you have an idea of a romantic church is very present because you feel you feel really it was a very uncertain period in romanic church it allows where I will try to find in a moment uh there there are some some places that make you understand what presence is and uh that romantic is not Roman it's after the in the middle age what they did in the middle age and so they were very essential but in reality very charged with the spirituality so in some way we understand that the people of the past sometimes was more present we see even in the position of the body people tend to fall forward the more and more we see we see even in many while in reality when we see the answer in the Egyptians you know if you see the yellow glyphics is very interesting as the Ancients were very vertical then they kept them very vertical keeping vertical if you see people you see people falling forward a lot or stay like this this is a tendency naturally when but when you think too much you go thinking thinking thinking thinking and in some way you lose for instance when uh it's naturally that sometimes you must think but it's like eating it's natural that sometimes you must eat if you eat all the time is no more natural so if you think too much all the time also there is overthinking it's a like overeating you understand it's more clear aristoba so you can have a people that for some reason is present we can see I can see people people are some people of normally people that doesn't work on this presence on what we teach here cannot maintain long a long time is his presence they have normally problems because they they don't really have a solid basis because you can even cause that presence with the attention you construct yourself stronger and so on but if you construct it with attention is not the real verticality you must do it's like the voice you can go to accounts of voice and maybe you change your voice but if it doesn't come from yourself it will be not natural will be an effort or the vertical you can try to be very vertical sometimes you say see people that is too vertical they do too much tension with the muscle they are fences they are tense people uh in reality vertical should be natural look as a small child of one year you will see that is very vertical without any effort when they begin to to to walk for example they do it very very naturally have I under as well to your question Yuba personally okay one more um so um I have another question regarding people who has for example personality disorders as a sociopaths narcissists and and so cyhopods they have natural Charisma to to gain attention of the target to the person that they want to to have agenda with uh um how about how about them it's like it's it's like for me it looks like like survival mechanism like their natural Charisma is like survival program um there is not the natural Charisma or for instance we work here they are in some way as possession you understand as possessed by the necessity of bangs Away by the necessity of doing something an example were for example Hitler Hitler was apparently was very charismatic but if we read what he writes in some way it was like possessive it was not afraid it was free of the choice it should do it was like obliged to do something so in some way it was not a it was a something constructing it's like being possessive in some way what uh what he did while in reality presence the real presence started for a natural way of buying and this is the natural construction of dual membrane is not uh in some way is different from this kind of presence that you see in these people that also they are and you store the correctly they are not open to all stimuli they are very selective in the stimuli that they listen while a present person will willing some white be very open he will speak to you uh or to another person if normally a present person will not be superb for example or will never treat another human being as a person to not to be considerate when a person does like this in reality is focalizing is energy in some direction that is not human in some way presence is not about vocalizing the energy in this way but creating energy in a natural way it's true that sometimes these people seems to have a lot of energy it seems to have but most of the time this creates also some some other problems uh when they don't get to the results when something gets wrong and so um thank you Marco so much it's very valuable um information that you share right now uh can you um can you can you give a tips how to differences in the beginning of how to see uh in the beginning stage um on let's say can we get attention to specific body language to get more idea about this is natural presence of person trying to pretend that he is like normally a person with a natural present is more human is more human and didn't cut off the emotion that is Master of the emotions it means I will I will tell you uh an example about presence that comes from a Chinese Chinese story uh the Storyteller is that somebody with sunflower flowers waiting for a girl this person is there is very emotionated very emotionated and if this girl doesn't show up he's very very sad but when this person work on presence maybe he's still there with a bucket of flower waiting for a girl but if for some reason this girl doesn't come it's not a problem is something that can happen in life it's nothing that to worry him and he will do something else he will do but he if the girl arrive he will be very warm very open it's a way his master of his emotions you understand better the the concept is not the slave of his emotions that in some way his number are able to so it's always the same situation but is a completely different way of being lived I will answer to Jack Jack yes doctor I have a question about the presence that's the sale and then sometimes let's just say I'm driving and when I stop and for a moment I'm relaxing I we have a scene that caught us in science um well the harmatic that this the symbol you showed me it's a when I stand like wait maybe maybe for sometimes for five minutes and I'm like kind of practicing presents the only thing I feel is uh is something raising in the right side of the body and goes in the brain on the right side it's kind of like electric and cold like buzzing thing it stays in the slight side of the head and after sometimes it's like you look around you it's everything kind of like changes it lights up it's a little more brighter but that situation stays for like 20 seconds and after 20 seconds everything falls back to to to the another things because the mind started thinking okay what's going on what's going on because you think those kind of thing yeah okay uh when you add this kind of sensation don't uh in reality I understand that probably you are very happy of this sensation and you want to increase it to also don't worry about increasing it just stay present uh you will absorb it the Sensation will be lower but in reality you will feel more energized in the whole body continue to normally when we walk on presence we let every manifestation style but we don't stay in the manifestation because if we stay in the manifestation we observe without worry for example you say I feel my energy going up okay I feel it but I don't uh I don't try to enhance it um yes if you can uh sometimes for but just uh just your stay as an observer because otherwise so you permit you will do a Next Step actually the the goal you stay observed in a permitting I should say permitting this is the best way of expressing it I answer I see that what I thought today gave a lot of question and I am happy that everybody is asking um Christopher uh can you speak major is applicable foreign foreign we can think because they have they are completely they they've lost their body normally the present people they are not very aware of it and after I will tell you some other elements Christopher but I will answer because I will go I will continue the lesson on the line of presence Jaime your second question okay tell me yeah so I have a question uh regarding um when you spoke regarding mastering your emotions so um I have a tendency in situations to uh to not be reactive like um like if I'm talking to a client I wait a moment to Jaime did you notice of this this is November communication and this is an emotional problem that you have inside that you normally when we listen to people or manifesting um there is always some emotional problem okay go okay and um and so like I have a tendency like if if I'm working with a client and um they they they might say something mean or offensive um I won't really fight back I'll just be very observant uh and I will be very firm on my suggestion like as far as like the solution to the problem and I'll take him right back to the solution like state is listed a statement like well the solution to a situation like this would be looking at and then like even though they just might have totally just punched me in the face uh verbally uh with saying something uh just because situations arise where people are in high states of stress um and so sometimes I just have a tendency to kind of like completely gear away from from from like a an emotion like that or sometimes if people are being reactive around me and people are like being like kind of hyperactive to a certain situation I just be kind of very Urban to their emotions and I just kind of um have a higher level of reservation and kind of like think about what's occurring so or even just just just relationships I tend to kind of like not want to um like fight back and and when I can even if I'm right and even if I have a point and even if I see something that's totally obvious sometimes I feel like like I'd rather just observe to see what's going on to try to uh ease the situation would you say that's kind of like a piece of what you're referring to would you see that suppression because uh ultimately I've been able to navigate through complex matters especially in business in a pretty relatively efficient way making me very um successful in a way in that but would you say that's kind of like what you meant by that or would you say that's kind of like something different okay I will explain uh you spoke of business maybe you are with the client and the client uh at the moment uh you know a person may maybe I realized that uh assessment with a client and the clientele ah but you are completely um stupid to sell this house at this price nobody will you are the the salesman and you listen to to the client that you want to create some emotion probably you say I understand you uh but uh the the house is at this price uh we cannot it so you speak with him in a way and you don't go as part of his emotion you can play with his emotion in case we can do so you can do whatever but in you you stay aware but also something times normally the clients the least not because it's convinced of what he said attends to you big but just because you want to test you if you are stable in your position or not stable the same is for the client in therapy the client in therapy something is like a little child normally when the client therapy is reacting like this is their little child reacting so when a child a little child say to you you are stupid you don't worry because he's a little child so in some way but at the same time you don't stop to Love This Little Child because he told you that you are stupid because there are two different elements it doesn't touch your emotions you understand if you have a little child a son or your son is stupid because of your stupid blonde you stay you understand why he says it sometimes you want to manipulate it but you don't stop to love him uh because because you are in some way you are master of your emotions in some moments you are a master of your emotion in some moment you are not aware of your emotion this issue they are even shared that are very good manipulate the parents but it's true that you must keep uh you keep emotion you keep but you don't let that emotional will guide you you can feel it you know it you are able to understand what it is in the client and in you and this is a difference between being without emotion or the other Psychopathic that was described by before by by uh because in some way you keep the emotion you know the emotion you participate also in the emotion and you want to do well buying of the other person because a person person understands that that is why we are all connected and as we are all connected we what a person feel is also in some way so we go together in some way so we go together even if we maintain our presence I maintain the foot or the handle because sometimes it will be very difficult different difficult and you will be find very manipulative people okay I have told us something this is a key very important because when you work with a person and you do magnetic passes I will show you now something with Andrea already I showed you but I show you again Andrea can you tell to your friend to come thank you I will do something that I think I many times I I show and it is very interesting we will begin doing very simple Manita because I did it already one time but no no stay stand up stand up tell it to your friends to stand up okay uh you will uh this I did already five days ago five times ago you will do magnetic passes okay uh Andrea listen to me anymore she will close her eyes okay she will close her eyes you will begin to do magnetic passes at a certain point I will see my hand collect this not very pleasant to do passes you do passes like this but at a certain point you see my hand like this this is the moment in which you put to presence and I think in this moment we will see a very big difference so tell her to close her eyes closer okay go go begin like this foreign now continue continue continue normally no matter very when you see you can even not to do anything and she will react you see put just your hand with the on your body and when I yes put just to your end like this around her body okay as before and at the moment I will tell you to be very present thank you oh yeah okay go out at the height of the solar plexus okay when I tell to you or you will I see you I had already told me now it was more evident Santa you didn't catch when I moved my hand okay see you didn't understood very well when I put it I thought you were lowering the head now okay okay he will do again because he didn't understand very well when I go the hand to go up you will do okay foreign okay she's already reacting but go in another Point okay okay when when I move you okay when I move you will be very present okay okay perfect okay the first time he didn't understood very well but uh we can do it many times okay and I go back to the uh to the loop okay and you can wake her up she's alive okay so you understand that when he put more presents people feel something people speak something this small presence will be also sure more hurt in the head hands but it's true that he did also at a certain point with the distance that was a locked but in the girl felt it so if you put the presence I advise you to do it when you you work with a client you do passes and at a certain moment you decide I want to be present praise and you stay very present in your body in some way you don't worry I want to explain when you are a very present you don't worry a lot about him you know what he does but in reality you you feel your body the body will be the background of the reality this we could say you are always in the in your body but normally is not to the background of your reality but when you are presented the body is the background of your reality and there was also uh a question before that was done by somebody about uh about pain we will walk in some moments or so about pain um I will listen to the chatter because I saw that uh Bailey okay and then Marco yes Leah asked would the exercise maintaining presence in just the end of food help but my mind stop racing yes uh this was for Leah but she will listen um and after uh is the joys that asked how we deal with pain and the pain during mirror exercise because he has some kinda we will discuss in some moment azina tell me and after I will give you another exercise about the presence and we will work on the on sleeping yes tell me thank you uh my question is about it's not about the exercise that Andrea did just now my question is about presence like filling your hand or feeling your your foot legs and can um I have some sort of obsessive um like movements like when I talk to somebody I always attach my finger fingers and can I use it for presence don't don't use something that you already do try to stay in something that is less lesser they are because it's like when you have the pain if you do attention to your body when you have a pain it's an attention that already exists and you forget to the rest of your body the the other part of your body uh you understand do with the part normally you should the presence is more when you do on a part that is less present not with the part that is more present that is naturally present and finally I would say I read recently is noticed that worked with that he didn't know anything about presence but did unconsciously something that has a lot to do with what we do he worked with the regressions and after he told during this regression so I put their attention on the hands or on the foot of the feet because they are the the places that are most these places are not touched normally by the environment and so in some way they can keep their attention they are without suffering this is very interesting because he discovered an element that governier uh to what we do we advise not to do work with regression in this way when we have directed the people but instead of to do crisis and the other techniques that we do that are very good but it's good that it is covered that making attention to the handle or to the food could be useful in difficult situations the obviously you are in the school our technique of the crisis I want to say is normally much more efficiently and regression and bring the attention this one in this way because there's something sometimes that is difficult to deal with uh okay um I will continue now and I will do now a an exercise with everybody of aromatic agency to give you more energy we will go a moment and after we will do again an exercise with Andrea cuarto we will show something else uh we will do now uh aromatic Academy exercise I want you to go in front of the middle you will have a 60 seconds one minute so to go in front of a mirror just Andre or everyone all right everybody even you one uh even you and you you have a video I put Andrea out of them okay okay this exercise of the magnetic agency is for developing your two branches that we showed before the right and the left we will move energy and we work we work on energy we will begin as always looking at ourselves at the center Don't Blink stay in front of the mirror Don't Blink hi hi may you are sitting but it's better when you can do it standing okay staying stay in front of the mirror and look at you at yourself in the center now observe yourself without blinking until now to do yourself in the mirror go backward as it was unless it were another person go back go back go back and you will notice that yourself will tend to go backward count for you go forward come forward come forward come forward come forward come forward come forward come forward stop if you do too much and after a go backward go backward to go back or to go back or to go back or to go back or to go backward come forward come forward come forward come forward come forward if somebody feel to follow I can't it can tell stop uh [Music] and now your hands are light they go up lights

go up they go up look at yourself always in the mirror at the center without blinking now your body is heavy very heavy heavy and now you permit a peaceful sensation in your solar place so hands can fall down now and you permit a peaceful sensation in your solar plexus one let yourself have a warm at your solar plexus one wait more open your solar plexus and now look after yourself this is the first step we will do always look at yourself in the mirror I look a little past yourself in the mirror if you see past yourself in the mirror you can see like an hour look past yourself in the mirror

maximum Force uxa you nail maximum Force you excited maximum Force you've said you will have a tingling sensation specific sensation in your body you know English sensation your exhale and now you look again to your to your right eye and you stay very pleasant to yourself you decide to be present to be there to be aware of yourself and now you turn around and you come to sit down your eyes are very good Jack Christopher Andrei urai is a photo of your eyes like this no it's really this exercise sometimes you can do without glasses uh I know that somebody tell I don't see me okay go a little near a little uh faster until you find a place where you can look at yourself without a need in the glasses no it it is always the somewhere um okay and this exercise is very good Katrina was good and this exercise developed before so normally what did you feel when you look at your left eye okay what did you feel I want to ask somebody Andrea won somebody else that want to speak or what he felt uh looking at his left eye I'm not sure yet um see I have that non-reversing mirror so okay you were very different okay you should look at your left eye if you have no reversing mirror you should do Loca on the other side you should look at the eye that is the left of your uh of uh of the back of the uh okay so against another person yeah yeah yeah right okay I will explain that Andrew all told me that he found on the internet a non-reversing hero about it or you've built it and he is using it it's good the same uh just obviously when in a normal Nero I say the left eye is on the left to you end of the reflected pencil when you walk on a non-reflective mirror you will do that's when you have a person in front it goes the same tell me um I would tell about what I felt when I was look at my left eye I noticed that I felt more myself yes yes it puts away it activates the utter any sphere we are very likely normally the left eye becomes in many people not in all but in many people uh bigger we see that there are like this I do myself uh the left eye become bigger than the right the right normally doesn't become bigger than the left but to the left tends to become bigger than the right this is because we have a different functioning of the hemispheres next people Jack tell me so I have noticed that when you were you're asking us to look Beyond yourself or something like that that time you see the aura or whatever it is it's around it's in kind of silver color right yes yes maybe maybe a four or five inch away from from your head or something and when we shift back to to the left eye it has changed uh I won't say I felt too much in my body but but the color has shifted to to kind of golden yellow that that I could see uh that's that's what I experienced with it yes yes in reality yeah normally what you are you are very sensitive you can um you can see uh in reality we are activating two different energies in the right and in the left eye the answer Egyptians are told the spoke of uh the eye of the sound and the eye of the Moon the left one being the eye of the moon I want to say if here we have somebody that is left-handed some time is good to check and to use your eyes in a different way when but if you are not a normally right-handed what I told do you applies perfectly sometimes we saw some people with uh that were left-handed that had much very rarely I should say one two times uh we should we we showed we saw people that were left-handed that had an advantages in uh changing uh in the Do-it exercise in the opposite way Andrea McDonald can you tell me something yes all right I could see my uh like the aura but it's clear I don't have any color or anything yeah it feels it looks like uh I don't know like a Heat's coming up from the road you know that Mirage for the moment for the moment that the exercise is not about the door for the moment the exercise is about the uh the two energies right and left we see that trying to see the aura before doing right and left increases the exercise after but it is not about the door Adora we do just to um to help a little uh the following exercise probably because you defocalize is a little uh you know after you vocalize probably you put more energy I don't know exactly why it works better but uh we saw that the scene Aura before doing the and doing also the or seeing yourself in some way will increase the results of the exercise this exercise in reality is a variation of an exercise that is of an answer region we connected it with the right and the left eye because it gives more results otherwise was also another version that was just looking at yourself at the center but it was very long you could take even 30 minutes to do it because when you look yourself in the center sometimes you are looking at sometimes you look so in some time you are more active and sometimes or you are more passive and there are disadvents this afternoon we change it in this exercise we're doing right and left eye and um one last question sorry and the sex essay we create like a new neurological connection yourself you see it's like you two brains go together uh people can ask how many times should I do this exercise I should say that um maybe you can do 20 30 times not to the same day naturally but in different day we'll change you it's like it creates some new neurological connection yes the same day I don't think it will be lasting but if you do in different days progressively you will notice that it's like a force that you develop in yourself you are probably more aware of the the two hemispheres and so on thank you my other question my mirror I have lights on it I was wondering no problem no problem uh if okay lights could it be helpful I use uh like a bright light here and a blue light like sun moon I I want to okay okay I want to touch you and to everybody we walked with every type of light every type of position every type um what is important is the exercise that I give to you after uh it's like sleeping or they are worth better but it's not to debate the basis the leading is basic uh basic or something else you understand so you can even sleep on the floor uh you say it's not the best okay but sometimes a person can sleep on the floor it's not the tool but it's the exercise so we exercise we did a lot obviously if you are in a sometime less line not less light but it depends a little this exercise works almost every time for after exercise sometime medium life is good for for example Clairvoyance your mirror is not the best one it should be better to have the rights behind but for right and left is perfect Katrina tell me speak yes yes I listen to you oh my God I don't I listen but I don't listen you have the microphone too low or go near the microphone to speak I have no idea where it is no no now I listen to you you are too far from the microphone just this when we got to the left eye it still sounded like I zoomed out like I noticed that it it was I can't the word was like disassociated but it was like I immediately noticed in my eyes started watering and then I started screaming and it was like I came back into the room as I I can always see my aura so when we went in the mirror to begin it was bigger over here the big face this is classical on the left eye I didn't say it of my I I myself I saw a lot of time when you see the big five big eye or changes like this normally on the left eye this is when you have some self-hypnosis that you produce on yourself in some way your eyes are no more like this so this we call it the big face but it's not just the big face can be the big eye or other changes or you are the screen grabbing now where this happens because you're changing some white the brain work and so you guys will see the stuff differently yes yes it's good stuff what you what you what you are describing the name that we gave we gave in jargo is a big face when you see the big face so when you see the big face you so also you know that you are in a sort of self-hypnosis and your mind is very open okay Jack I have I have felt this thing doctor like when we are doing this exercise in the moment and uh yeah yeah no no there any exercise let's just say this mirror exercise we did and in the moment it sometimes you don't feel something maybe not in your body or whatever but when you you are done with this thing or you are doing doing something else in your day if you feel like something is going on now like it's kind of like it's it's kind of delayed uh kind of thing maybe after five minutes ten minutes or maybe sometimes the next day but that's what just sometime yes you build up something you build up for more energy you will feel more energetic normally we create this energy that is uh coming back to the this is the hermeticado sea when we go back to our aromatic Audacity Of before yeah we can understand a little better so we have the two eyes of the cell the snakes and so in some way we are activating the two snakes and activating the two snakes we are activating the central energy and so we create something different because in some way and to IR levels that are symbolized by the wings that open up the wings can even refer to the fact that we should rate to have more energy but in this case they refer to the fact that you go to IR levels from here the Energy starts when you are present to this exercise will be stronger it means starting for presence the road will go at the center stronger and this exercise will be very very useful I did it many times I found after you will find the 20 30 times you need to you have a new it's like something new you create in yourself new neurological connection you will feel more presence probably you wake up a side that is not awakened so you will you will harmonize the two sides it's possible so to do this exercise as self-hypnosis when I when we normally right eye left eye and after we come back to the right eye when we come back to the right eye we decide to be present this is the best but you could decide even something else for example to enter in a different state as you put a a clothes on yourself when you come back on your right eye and in this case it's like a sort of surf hypnosis I for example there is an exercise that I think we will do in uh some license that is called the warmer warm water and cold water and you should put the handy one glass and the other glass and change the sensation I tried a lot a lot of this exercise without having results one day I did the exercise after looking in the mirror and I thought to myself now I entered myself that will feel this sensation on the right hand and this sensation on the left hand I did and the first thing I did maybe I have done wrong and I have put the glasses in the wrong position but after in reality the glasses were not in the wrong position I really had the sincere uh I really I really changed a lot I was was incredible it was incredible when I did uh I thought maybe I I'm wrong probably I ever put because it was so clear I had to feel warm here and called maybe the glasses are not uh I don't know so in some way you can put another yourself okay in this case it's just for an exercise but you can do not just for an exercise also you can put yourself more sure but at the end of it more charismatic more direct go always on presence so it's good to go normally to put your yourself more present just in time as for the example that I give gave to you you can put something else but normally uh is if you put away more present you can put already a super State because presence I want to give also another example of present to understand uh there was a a check that coined the word Flow State the flow state is when a person is very good very active very able to react the only problem of the Flow State described by this check is no normal is under condition for example the person is in a flow State when it writes his car is a very world champion driving car but he must do one in his car nobody must make him uh is okay so he has a lot of conditions before feeling in the flow for instance it's like you are in the floor without needing these conditions without you are in the flow but you don't need the conditions because in some way you have put away the emotions that block you and make that this state of this flow state is just in some rare moments and in some rare circumstances so in some way you are more open this this is another possible descriptions this Flow State this flow this present state is a super Flow State for example they are and this is also an address there are some um some artists that maybe some actors that maybe they are very good on the scene but and apparently they are very present the master of the scene this is a flow state because maybe if you tell to this uh this actor I didn't like your show he will feel a strong emotion he will not be a be able no more to to do it well and so in some way he's not really present you understand the concept so for instance like a flow state that is without the conditions because the conditions are normally a more um why we have a condition for this Flow State because we are connected to reality to different reality in life and this reality traumatism a situation made us react only uh in some situation in other situation we cannot react so we are not able to use our full potential for instance like a reintegration of ourselves to get this reintegration we must go outside of our thoughts because our thoughts are also our worries uh with a person park a car in the car is parked and after a warrior did I pack the car did I put the right ticket did uh did I will find continue to worry worrying work so in some way uh Sometimes some some thoughts are completely in useful uh we see a person who's a husband or a Woman What's called and after how many times he's thinking how she's gone she's gone she's gone she's gone she's gone yes she's gone but how many times should you repeat it to know it because he is continuing repeating repeating repeating this person is not present do you understand the concept and so presence in some way is a flow State without condition under condition is not presence can be a flow State can be a good State can be partial State can be something that can be developed in any case presence is sit now as a direction this is the best way to see see now as a direction you are like a like an athlete you are working on or running and this is the direction what is the difference between you and a strong person in that you can meet today that you have an healthy direction that you can work regularly and so on yes sometimes maybe you can build but you are still an athlete after you recover and you will still run and do everything else you understand the concept you must always in the concept is always coming back to the presence okay Andrea now I wanted you to do something with your um a friend and we will see now after two elements uh before doing it yes we can um I will do it with everybody the Oklahoma the okolo motor blockage because today I don't think we already did the Oklahoma blockage Katrina did we do the Oklahoma blockage no okay we will doing this course we did in the past cars okay please uh this is a presentation you can use while with your clients why because sometimes you must address okay okay because a presentation to work with your clients why why you must introduce November techniques but how Andrea you work with your friend at this point okay what's anticipated I will see it now standing or uh you will say you will uh we will do now an exercise for to exercise for uh insomnia I will do something I will show you some something that can be done with the for insomnia and uh also some uh exercise uh about the use of the guys the the the lock in the hands and something else looking there so we can even do but uh take your friend okay are you with her okay uh uh now before I wanted to look uh make her sit make us sit down we will see one or two techniques that are very good if you have somebody that must uh okay go in front of her take her hands by the wrist stay status then stand up and look at here okay but very very you will very calm think Serenity no no I ever sit down okay perfect good think Serenity when you look at her yeah okay foreign Russia [Music] take put a hand that you touch here and the other hand here don't touch uniform only only Bank no back you touch very very pleasant foreign [Music] stay like this without touching the bending since I took us for a patch okay in general this passes that he did now are very good for insomnia besides this passes uh in some way the person we find very well besides this passes are also some exercises to stimulate the okay make her uh Open the Eyes now foreign almost us let's see okay relaxed these are very good passes for helping people to uh to go down to foreign people to sleep and this way of looking you don't look strong in the eyes because you keep the person in a strange way in any case you must also know something uh something that told no I had once I was that that thought was a famous uh American hypnotist about hypnosis that is very valid also about humanities that if here this morning I will give two times the money back to a person when it comes to me and he's for sleeping and he enters in hypnosis and he doesn't sleep why because sleeping is Letting Go and also here we let go we should also say something when we do passes so we walk this can help also to sleep and also working on the parasympathetic response because the parasympathetic we activate a lot and we have our client activated the parasympathetic we help our client to sleep okay uh now I sometimes the after romantism I should say most of the time people doesn't sleep not because they cannot sleep but because they have traumatism so work on the automatism and the person and after on this techniques because if we work on these techniques without dealing with the traumatism you will not get the right results these are passes for helping people sleeping um I will anticipate also something because already we anticipated something the other time and I look a moment at the lesson thank you okay catalepsi we did catalyptus I want not to do that now because I prefer to do with everybody next uh next time uh and um uh this right okay we'll give you two or three exercises more about the presents that are very good to do uh and uh how to be more sure okay yes we have done everything that is in this part and next next week we will do even surprise therapy personal management and so on okay after techniques obviously you must do the stopper by with yourself so you we can uh you can do the stop putting your clock three times a day for example uh three times a day that I will do the stop now when I do stop don't move stay like this stop visual auditory listening kinesthetic feeling the body kind of stuff this technique is very good to this is called the stop we do it a lot of time in groups because in groups when we see that a person's leap the other person can wake him up because sleeping in our language means beginning to think too much beginning to be too much in our tops also so when we see that a person is too much in the doctor a stop can be very strong visual kinesthetic feeling your body auditory end of stop look at that Alexander uh sometimes we do movement and Evangeline sometimes we do movement and we are not aware of this was the reason for the Stop returned by by gulja for stored in the stops but our stop is a little different from that go Jeff because we divide the visual auditory kinesthetic if you learned NLP you learn that the that there are people that is more visual more auditory and more kinesthetic this is this uh sometime we see effectively that some people is too much individual so when we do a stop they risk to stay too much in this one this mostly for the Western people we can think that so people stay very visual but in reality don't stay really in his body so doing a stop on the on these three elements will make a stop more harmonic and more complete um if we wanted to know what uh told the Mesmer about what nnp mismatch didn't know NFP but in reality I wrote something very that applies very well it says when somebody uses too much earring uh is when he has fear if you have somebody in your house entering you do a lot of attention to the sound if you have a risk that arises in front of you you will observe you will use your site so in some way fears is the reason why a person stay too much in a sense or in another sense we Thrive instead to create Harmony this is what Thomas were told and is practically is true because sometimes traumatism block us in too much seeing too much listening and we learn in this way to balance the things there was a concept in Mass management that was the concept of Harmony when we balance the senses we go to the global things if we don't don't balance the senses we don't go to the global sense do Global sense Master told them we can perceive The Impossible more the metaphysic another dimension but only when we balance ourselves if we stayed only when we stay in our Global sense if we stay too much in one sense or in another sense we will just see this harmony I want to say is also mainly kinesthetical because the kinesthetic is the basis when we is not equal visual auditoric anesthetic kinesthetic is the background after we have on it the auditory and division because the every animals is very kinesthetic every even the child if You observe it's just a human species that sometimes get very visual because they want to observe read the books General and animal look at something but after go back in his feelings perception of the body this is also important to understand about the child they observed too much electronic games when the child is to return give a big problems because why because the child must be for touch and after c if they see before touching they will become unrest they have all rest they they don't perceive really the reality normally it's like a pyramid before we must know the reality by touching it if you end after you must see it and you see that the child normally they do it they do around they touch everything they try to to get in contact they feel and so when you are grown you say you you have the feeling of everything that U.S is around uh you so instead when you say something is real with you don't have to touch it you see and you know even already the sensation so in reality you have the sensation attaching the the sensation is the starting point and even in the philogenesis it means in the history of the senses the first sense was the sensation that in the sense that we know for the hearing data has some movement inside the ear and we and but we even the scientists observe it that the sense of sight comes from unsigned moment when we use the uh when we did it so we didn't divide too much today the classroom that I would do now just to answer to questions with Kathy okay and with uh I will speak with the English and Spanish are just to people uh so we will I I want to now to divide the classroom to answer to question we have 7 and 50 and we did already what was in the program we gave the stop we gave the other elements so we will divide now the it's good to divide the classroom maybe we do some exercise just for French English and we will do about 15 minutes in the in the in the class in the classroom I will now divide career Allah session one I will do Alexander Andrew Andrea Anthony azina Christopher and see Christopher I will do a session for Christopher Elite and okay because they speak Spanish and we I will do David David he doesn't speak that good Spanish He Speaks better English okay I was trying to speak Spanish with him the first time and he said I prefer English okay okay at this point I will put I will put English and I would do English David okay I will put a French uh this is the best one uh differential in the group this is the best and I will just go to the French outside they will stay with you and I will speak with the theory I know from here I do something this this session I will close this session these people can stay in the main room Alexander Andrew okay I will do just a session for the French now so the French people are asking to to to go in the uh to to to to go in the uh in the room that I will open if I I forgot some French you will tell me and I will put okay and I the you are with Kathy okay so the French can enter in the session with Katie and the other people they keep here okay somebody asked some question I will um I will answer tell me I have questions regarding um how we can effectively work with um personal disorders as um is usually is multi multi this is very good uh fires yes yes this is uh oh there is a very good technique so to work with personality disorders there we have two ways to work with this multiple personality disorders one is Crisis and the second why and the second one one is like working with the path Center in the paths of the body there is something that we can do in the advanced the mountain here and you enter into there you you could you are in the advantage you could ask here the crisis could the crisis also good to work with the past because it can let because when a person is blocked this can also be expressed as Parts a person feel blocked and so when uh we Block in this when we walk in this way it is good even Mass metal detail Wellness May wrote a book and he told um somebody uses Spirit day most Gods but it's very simple is energy and so uh in some way he wanted to say that there that this concept of energy applies also to paths law to pass so there are two wise one y is in this way and the actor is practically with a series of regression where we enter in this sample personalities and after we release we can even mix for the even if we will see the complete system in advance you can do a regression entering as a personality uh work with this personality as a as a person even if it is a past life and do a crisis and you will release you will free it this is the simplest way they use it uh in any in any culture I should say that is why the crisis and the crisis and in another personality and after any crisis is a technique that is practicing practically in every in every culture uh and the other uh I excuse me I put the moists in the his group s okay uh application that somebody of you can have otherwise I will do something with Andrea Heine uh what would you say is the best method for like self-crisis uh next election we do serve guys is but they can anticipate to you and uh next lesson if you feel sometime some emotion yourself or something like this that tends to increase the distention permit yourself to increase distention because the standard yes to the upper Parts as we did the oculomotor blockage as we do in the upper moctaw blockage and permits to your body to move normally the body is stuck but maybe I have this hand that's stuck and but I understand that we want to do a movement I increase the movement increase increase I will see that this at the moment it will become automatic next lesson we will do and don't use uh if you want to take your body move let your eye when you begin to see that your eyes but I I am body begins to move let your eyes go up like looking at the center of your head I answer to you very fast tell me foreign I have a question how if you are influenced by someone else around how do you know if it's that difference uh when you are influenced um stabilizing that I want to tell you the contrary how to influence other people so don't try to influence people in Big Stuff try to influence this more stuff and you will become friend it means uh you will have a more feeling with them if you try to influence people in big stuff they can feel it and after they will not love you but if you try to have a person with a handle move a finger or something like this or something that is not very critical to his personality he will accept and this finger will move on the person will move he will in some way will accept it will uh he will uh it's like you enter a little him you are great you will create a better connection with this person if you want to avoid somebody influencing you or compressance if you are compressions by practically you are you stay always aware of a part of your body if you have you understand yes I know but how do you differentiate if someone you don't know and you feel he's influencing you how can you differentiate it's for the best or it's for Worse no don't worry just stay present to yourself because what uh we don't know what is better or if uh what is bad office good we don't know absolutely you just must stay present and uh and okay because a person is not a person he has his opinions and so he can think that is your for your good but is not uh for you good so it's not useful to think if somebody want to uh for good or forbid you must be yourself okay okay thank you and do you have even some super screen behind you but before there is Jack that speaks all right I think what she's asking is uh how do you know if someone else is trying to influence you how do you yeah no I don't worry try to be aware in any case you feel if you if you feel some time a very bad influence you can imagine a a this is a like you are you have light around you starting from the your solar plexus if you have a an enemy that you think you will influence you in a very very very [Music] um difficult cases you can imagine that you have a shield of mirrors around you so in some way water but this is bad because after he will send again to him what you get uh what he will send to you so it's better to imagine light so you will destroy without doing any harm to him [Music] it's even too bad for him uh do imagine just to have light that protects you and so uh light will destroy his influence without you don't worry about him you need not to worry about your worst enemy because you must worry about yourself you must use your mind for yourself and not for your worst enemy okay and Jack yes doctor I have a question when when you give a non-verbal command to close their eyes let's just say I'm a beginner right I could ask them to close their eyes but how you give a non-verbal command to close their eyes let's see in this case I will do some you must put intention I will do something with Andrea now if if he wants to um uh under uh you must think that the staff is already there and normally it will happen uh Andrea work a little with your uh girl that that tell her that to close his eyes I will answer to one Christopher and we will do in the moment and exercise hello Andrea listen to me listen to me now we will begin at work with her at a certain point you will go a little away and you will decide how to change breathing you change your self-breathing uh she doesn't understand in any case that she's Spanish I don't think we should understand okay now Christopher tell me what uh you want to ask me they teach him to use the mirror so he will be more sure give him more uh teach him some elements of attention to his body that we did now uh having um also in some way his probably was he had this you can do some crisis if in this case that we will discuss in the past if he's very young you can look into his eyes and give some a good suggestion because young people will react very well he can even give himself to himself with the mirror normally this kind of technique should work very well now we will work and leap done we walk okay uh please uh stay like this okay please uh go a little far from this girl please uh okay are you in evidence put your I tried to put your video I think your video is in evidence okay okay now try to think that she must come toward you okay I bet you are very successful uh now follow my hand okay uh pushing this is sending away two audio okay maybe the intention okay stop now try to work on a on an arm stay a little uh turn you around turn around a little towards look at the screen look at the screen okay let it Let Your Hand by side okay imagine to be her see her with your guys and try to want that you want to move the same the same arm that you move lower okay go down with to disarm again okay try to change breaking break them up don't change the pace okay perfect stop a wake up wake up okay uh practically you must imagine to be the person and do the movement this was your question is you have a friend and you work with this friend a lot of time and this is a very good way to access uh on the arm we didn't see it very well uh with the breathing uh you Andrea you told me that she's changing the breathing which I couldn't see very well but for coming forward I saw that he worked well so I we had the button you don't you don't work on very how to say critical stuff you work on a non-critical stuff uh going backward going forward going with a hand and you will see that the people or person will also very much appreciate it in some way because is what I told you before to to stay in contact because she will feel that you are in contact with her and sometimes you will see something very really really incredible and now we close the lesson naturally and the your last question and after we close for everybody the lesson okay good question so just now you said when you're in the present stage you uh feel that you're moving someone as someone's body like uh with Andrea Andrea just did so you imagine yourself as the person yes the world that accusing the uh that's using the Virginia you are the actor that is you listen you are the actor that is you it's like they need identification you are the actor that is you beautiful yeah I I think I did that I was reading your book and um I didn't know that this is a technique because the guy was driving off the road so I like imagined I was holding the steering wheel and turned it back so and then they squirt back onto the road so yeah um okay try to do everything that we do do next time we will see some crisis will answer to your last question if the French will arrive now and we will close now um Marco how after this uh contact because seems like I did this naturally all the time with my clients it's cool and how to disconnect yourself after this uh stay in your body and in the case we do some breathing that are very good so you breathe out or you do the the energy exercise of the first day
