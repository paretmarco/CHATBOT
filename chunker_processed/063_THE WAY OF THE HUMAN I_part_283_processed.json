  "title": "What is the Primal Energy and False Core Conclusion and How are They Fused in One's Identity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, Denise and Wolinsky explore how people fuse their False Core Conclusion with primal animal energy. They identify examples of this fusion, such as \"I am crazy,\" and discuss how people develop a False Healing Solution to compensate for this fusion. By separating primal energy from the feeling of being alone, people can gain a clearer understanding of their primal energy and explore different ways of integrating it into their lives.",
  "content": "Therapeutic Note Here again we see the primal repressed energy fused with mom and labeled as the False Core Conclusion, \"I am crazy\"---A False Self 174 The Way of the Human â–  Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Therapeutic Note Her False Core of \"Alone\" gets fused with that primal energy which is also fused with \"I am crazy.\" Denise:Well...permission to claim the energy as mine or a right to have it. Wolinsky:What was assumed, decided or believed that got you to not having this energy as mine? Denise:I didn't want it because it looked like it was too much. Therapeutic Note People fuse their False Core Conclusion with the primal animal energy. This primal energy (in this situation) equals \"Alone.\" For example, if I have this primal energy, associated with \"There's something wrong with me,\" would yield the False Healing Solution: I must be perfect. Wolinsky:If you separate primal energy and alone, what oc- curs? ________________ Chapter VIII I see that. It's almost like sane versus crazy. Take the label off of primal energy as crazy and the hood as sane.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to develop multi-dimensional awareness, it is crucial to separate ourselves from false core beliefs and labels that we have internalized. By recognizing primal energy as simply energy and tracing it back to its source, we can find liberation from the limitations we impose upon ourselves."
