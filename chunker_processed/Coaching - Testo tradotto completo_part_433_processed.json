  "title": "How can understanding hypnotic regression help in communication and sales?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author discussed the influence of expectation and the different ways people behave under hypnosis. In the last 200 words, they delve into ways to deal with individuals experiencing a \"regression to an earlier age\" and how to communicate with them either in a passive or an authoritative manner. The author explains that having a rapport with the subject is crucial for the utilization of the passive mechanism, while being big and strong, as well as wise and powerful, leads to the adoption of the authoritative mechanism. The author also introduces the idea of magnetic individuals acquiring prestige through non-verbal tools and creating a favorable setting for projections.",
  "content": "Let us think of how a mother or a father communicates an idea to a child when dealing with him. The subject wants us to address him either in a passive or in an authoritative manner. The passive manner is the maternal one. Having a rapport with the subject is an essential prerequisite for resorting to the utilization of this mechanism. The authoritative manner is more fatherly in nature. Having prestige is a fundamental prerequisite to the adoption of this different mechanism. Let us picture the way in which father figures are perceived. They appear to be bigger and more powerful than the child. The keys to prestige and status are forever to be sought in being big and strong, as well in being wise and powerful. The magnetic person knows how to acquire prestige in a non-verbal fashion, without at the same time activating critical resistance and forms of opposition in the other person, inasmuch as the magnetic individual only acts on the strength of non-verbal tools. In particular, due to the fact that the magnetic attitude is not easily captured and forced into a restrictive frame, it tends to create a favourable setting for projections.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the power dynamics at play in communication can be useful in various settings, including sales. By adopting either a passive or authoritative approach, and utilizing non-verbal tools to acquire prestige, one can create a favorable setting for projection and achieve a sense of regression in the other person, leading to effective communication and potentially successful outcomes."
