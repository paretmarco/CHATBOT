  "title": "\"What are the three ancient methods of meditation based on 'retirement in silence'?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, three ancient methods were presented, all based on the concept of \"retirement in silence\", where the student must silence their mind and relax their body. The first method involves creating a mental image of a desired outcome while in a state of calmness. The second method involves focusing on the solar plexus, believed to be a second brain with influence over both body functions and emotions. In this final section of the text, the use of symbols and images are explored as tools for transmutation and personal improvement. These techniques involve visualization, the use of light, and the creation of mental matrices to manifest specific outcomes.",
  "content": "After writing what you want, readably and briefly, set yourself at ease and focus on your script, concentrating the thought with intensity, but calmly, on the meaning of the lines you have on sight. Breathe deeply and slowly. The procedure just described bases on the theory that by this means you get to produce in a perfect way some mental streams in full strength. Another explanation could come by considering the quantum nature of reality, or by the principle of synchronicity stated the first time by Carl Gustav Jung. Those who finally want to adopt a fully psychological point of view may think that it works because we create a \"matrix\" in our unconscious mind that tends to facilitate the occurrence of certain events. If you at first express simple and reasonable wishes as to enjoy better health, mental abilities, a sweeter character, you will probably succeed immediately. Insofar as you exercise, you can do more precise and detailed questions, such as those that we have mentioned. Until you will not ask for something harmful, either directly or indirectly, for the rights and happiness of your neighbor, you will get a measure of success based on the sincerity and intelligence you will show following this procedure. Second Method The second method is that of solar plexus. The solar plexus is the large central nerve of the spinal cord, behind the stomach hollow. Some scientists claim that the solar plexus is a brain — the abdominal brain — and that has an influence not only on body functions like breathing and heartbeat, but also on the emotional nature of the individual.",
  "last_phrase": "By following the methods described in this text, you will be able to develop mental strength and resolutely decisive will. The exercises mentioned here, based on the principles of quantum reality and synchronicity, as well as psychological theories, will help you fulfill simple and reasonable desires related to your health, mental abilities, and character. With practice, you can progress to more specific wishes without posing harm to others. These exercises not only develop your hypnotic and mesmerizing abilities but also rejuvenate your inner self.
