  "title": "What is Quantum Discipline and How Can it Benefit Personal and Professional Success?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Quantum Discipline, an interdisciplinary field of science that applies the uncertainty principle and other quantum concepts to new areas such as psychology. The last 200 tokens focus on the practical application of Quantum Extreme Â® and the unique technologies involved, including the development of mental coherence and consciousness. The fascinating concept of a \"totipotent whole\" is discussed, which draws parallels between stem cells in biology and the encompassing nature of white light in quantum theory. The text also offers information on courses and certification programs for those interested in learning more about this field.",
  "content": "Register of mental states and possible informations: determining the number of possible states, that is the starting point for quantum operations and the creation of a coherent superposition. At this point, our unconscious mind can begin to operate 3. Interference from one item to the other: the act of an element on the set of transformations (calculations) quantum. Examples of interference are for example those made by symbolic elements. 4. Quantum Correlation/Entanglement: the fact that the two elements can come into contact and subsequently maintain a ratio (entanglement) between them. This concept applies even to magnetism, where people entangle at a distance and create distant reactions 5. Equilibrium/Balance is the central position that eliminates dissipative situations 6. Amplification of mental coherence The use of elements and rhythms that amplify the extreme quantum mode. 7. Reducing information: the reduction of the amount of information to a single element 8. Implicated order and explicate order: the two positions 9. Coherence and Decoherence of neuronal information: We need concentration. For a quantum computation can take place it is essential that the information remains consistent and is not lost to the environment 10. Holographic Model: the holographic model is essential to constitute a theory of learning and information retrieval. Approach implies a \"top-down\". 11. Presence and consciousness and their relationship with the implicate order. Presence can be a pathway to accede to the implicate order starting from the explicate order 12. Phase and Frequency: The information you have the same phase can be combined more easily.",
  "last_phrase": "The Quantum Psi methodology is a unique and innovative approach to personal and professional development that combines elements of NLP and quantum thinking to enhance communication, creativity, and problem-solving skills. By understanding the register of mental states and related concepts like interference, quantum correlation, and coherence, individuals can amplify their mental energy, reduce information, and achieve a state of balance that promotes quantum learning. The Quantum coaching program, which includes the sale of NLP-3 and concepts of Quantum Psi applied to sales and coaching, offers psychophysical strategies to help participants achieve success and become internationally certified Master Coaches."
