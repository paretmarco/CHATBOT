  "title": "How can intuition and customized strategies help in navigating the unpredictability of financial markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the importance of creating tailored strategies for different market directions and testing them through backtesting over several years and multiple time frames was emphasized. Now, with a focus on developing financial intuition, it is essential to highlight the significance of intuition which is different from an automatic mechanism. Using an example of the swing trading method, it is explained how important it is to determine the most critical move at a given moment before making any operational choices. The following text acknowledges the role of chance in financial markets, and the need for intuition to interpret the chaotic reality, rather than relying on automated systems.",
  "content": "Let us for instance use, as an illustrating example, the swing trading method, which is also defined as the double minimum or doubled maximum method. If the market is bearish, and my swings are negative throughout the “time frames”, I might end up “short” (= enter a downward position) with every pullback. What happens, however, if not all the swings are turned downward? In that instance, I would necessarily have to decide what represents the most important move for that moment, in order for me to then march onto the stage of making operational choices which are consequential thereon. Quantum Coaching for developing financial intuition Intuition is a superior mechanism. It represents our capacity of interpreting a reality which in itself is something chaotic. We are obliged to grasp the essence of the process of intuition. Intuition is utterly different from an automatic mechanism. The automatic mode is the way machines, too, function, as with the classical trading systems based on a software program. In actual fact, however, the world is governed by chance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing your financial intuition is crucial in navigating the chaotic reality of financial markets. Relying solely on automatic mechanisms or deterministic theories will ultimately lead to a stalemate or loss. Using methods such as swing trading and being able to interpret market swings are essential skills in making operational choices and achieving success in the world of finance. Quantum coaching can help you better understand and apply these skills for optimal results."
