  "title": "How does a \"little girl\" identity affect present self and past experiences in therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the discussion was about the \"little girl's\" fusion and separation from her present-time body. The focus was on how this little girl had to hold back her energy to please her mother and avoid abuse. Now, Nancy and Wolinsky explore what this fusion was repressing in the little girl--love, openness, playfulness, and joy--and what similarities and differences exist between her present and past selves. They investigate how her present-time body feels vulnerable when opening up this past part of herself.",
  "content": "Nancy:Love and openness of expressing her love and caring and affectiop, tenderness, vulnerability and kind of like a joy, a real openingness to life, playfulness, joy, the lord. Wolinsky:Where in your present-time body do you feel the love, the playfulness, the vulnerability, the affection, the sensualness, the joy, the loud? Now tell me a difference between you (pointing to her), this present-time body, and this little girl's three year old body (pointing to little girl image across the room)? Therapeutic Note I want to separate her, Tresent time self from her past time self. Nancy:The difference between my present-time body and her. I'm bigger, I'm stronger. Wolinsky:If this little girl fuses together mom and all people, what is that little girl creating? ________________ Nancy: Wolinsky: Nancy: Wolinsky: Nancy: ________________ I feel it like if I were to take that zipper down and open that up, it would be right there. And as you take a zipper down (pointing to the middle of her body) just for a second, how do you feel? Kind of vulnerable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by separating her present-time self from her past self, Nancy was able to identify the differences and acknowledge her growth. Additionally, through the practice of opening up and embracing vulnerability as pure energy, she was able to experience a range of emotions such as love, playfulness, and joy. These techniques can help individuals develop multi-dimensional awareness and empower them with the ability to self-regulate their emotions."
