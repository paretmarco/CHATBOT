  "title": "What is the therapy of the look and how can it be used to overcome fear and anxiety based on recent research and Eastern techniques?",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the power of fascination in overcoming fears and anxieties rooted in traumatic experiences. The therapy of the look is defined as \"the positive fascination which chases away the negative fascination derived from life experiences\". The researchers' study demonstrated that fear can be erased by recalling it and writing over it with a new memory within six hours. Instant Fascination is a technique pioneered by Erminio from Pisa, which is used to cure physical pains and ailments in a matter of seconds. The technique involves creating a state of void within which self-reorganization occurs.",
  "content": "Usually, the moments in which such fascination is born are interpersonal moments. The human personality is made up of a fear to lose the objects of its own fascination. The personality of the average man is a blend that is founded on the fear to lose one’s beloved, money, the house, etc. All the psychological categories we are able to discern grow out of some fundamental fear. Through the medium of fascination, therefore, we give birth to a state of void in which a spontaneous self-reorganization can occur, one that is facilitated by no longer concentrating on the outside, but rather on the inside and on the operator who then turns into a resource. Further comparisons with Eastern techniques The usefulness of being detached from involvement and from external “fascination” is something evidenced even by the comparison between the technique of fascination and some techniques of Trataka (that is, the prolonged staring at an object without flapping one’s eyelids) which are practiced in the East in order to engender a mental void. We can observe that sometimes, in the course of such practices, an image gets crystallized, thereby allowing one to appropriate its qualities. These practices have the further result of distancing one, even physically, from being involved with the outside. One of these techniques, for example, consists in fixing the so-called third eye. Another, preparatory technique is based on staring at one’s nose.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the state of fascination can be a powerful tool for self-reorganization and detachment from external factors. Eastern techniques such as Trataka also emphasize the usefulness of detaching oneself from external stimulation to achieve a mental void. Moreover, through various exercises, one can improve their magnetic look and control over their nerves and emotions. These practices require dedication, but the benefits are well worth the effort. With time and practice, one can achieve a state of calm and emotional control, leading to a happier and more fulfilling life."
