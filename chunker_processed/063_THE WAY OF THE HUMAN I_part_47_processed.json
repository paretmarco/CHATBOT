  "title": "What is the Eighth Dimension and its connection to the Collective Unconscious and Pure Awareness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author explains the difference between the Collective Unconscious (Seventh Dimension) and Pure Awareness (Eighth Dimension). The \"NOT-I-I\" is the place where pure witnessing and awareness rests between the I AM and the VOID. This VOID or Undifferentiated Consciousness is beyond Awareness and even that itself dissolves. The NAMELESS ABSOLUTE lies beyond the VOID, where it ends. The author clarifies that dimensions interact and are connected, yet beyond the VOID and THE NAMELESS ABSOLUTE, everything including awareness disappears.",
  "content": "Because the \"NOT-I-I\" is the WITNESS it knows and is aware of the VOID. The dimensions of manifestation end here (Volume III). This occurs because in the underlying unity of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE also called UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS even awareness itsetfdissolves. This is why noted physicist, John Wheeler, said, \"Nothingness is the building block of the universe.\" The VOID or UNDIFFERIELVTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or the SELF is beyond Awareness, and is pure UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or THAT (not to be confused with consciousness as in I-Thou). The NAMELESS ABSOLUTE is beyond the VOID and is where the VOID itself ends. BEYOND IS JUST BEYOND Please note: In the following illustration, the vertical lines connect all the dimensions. This denotes that the dimensions interact and are connected even though they have different functions. The broken horizontal line indicates that there is a \"relationship\" above and below. But \"you\" cannot work on the areas below the biological dimension, i.e., ESSENCE, I AM, COLLECTIVE, and NOT-I-I. The solid line between VOID and NOT-I-I shows that the VOID and THE NAMELESS ABSOLUTE and BEYOND are not dimensions because everything, including awareness, disappears \"there.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To develop your multi-dimensional awareness, it's crucial to understand that the VOID or UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and the SELF are beyond awareness, and that the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE is where the VOID ends. Dismantling your fixated awareness is a crucial step, rather than just transcending it, to reach a state of pure UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or THAT."
