  "first_phrase": "This section delves into a new, more extensive view of trance and its implications for hypnotherapy. The author explains how the traditional understanding of \"therapeutic trance\" is similar to the no-trance state in the Eastern practice of meditation. They argue that it is unnecessary to induce another trance to counter the symptom in the therapeutic session. Instead, the hypnotherapist should de-hypnotize the client from the trance they bring with them, creating a new paradigm shift. In the following chapter, the etiology of trance as a symptom will be explored. The section ends with examples of everyday trance states that underlie common problems, such as anxiety.",
  "content": "Furthermore, the job of the hypnotherapist was no longer to induce a trance but rather to de-hypnotize the individual out of the trance she was already experiencing. In short, there was no reason to create another trance to counter the symptom; rather, it was simpler and easier to utilize the trance (symptom) the client brought to the session. In the remainder of this chapter we will explore a new, more comprehensive view of the experience of trance that goes beyond Erickson's concept of the \"common everyday trance.\" We will see how Deep Trance Phenomena are at the core of a wide spectrum of experience that spans the symptoms, identities, roles, and reactions we create as adults. In Chapter 2 we will look at the etiology of trance as symptom as it is created and maintained in the early fans ily environment. Trance asSymptom Let's explore a few everyday examples of trance states that underlie COMMOT1 problems•to clarify this paradigm shift. Anxiety is a fear of the future.A client whose presenting ________________ A Day In The Life Of A Trance • 7 problem is anxiety might be using a cluster of Deep •Trance Phenomena to synthesize the sensation of anxiety.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by using the client's existing trance state as a tool for healing, rather than inducing a new trance state, hypnotherapists can help clients overcome a broad spectrum of symptoms, identities, roles, and reactions. Understanding the etiology of trance as a symptom can provide a new paradigm shift for addressing everyday problems such as anxiety. With this perspective, hypnotherapists can empower their clients to tap into their inner resources and overcome their challenges."
