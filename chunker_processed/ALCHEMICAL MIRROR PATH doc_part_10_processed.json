  "title": "How can mirror gazing and self-reflection lead to higher levels of consciousness and lucid dreaming?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a guide to working with mirrors in order to unlock higher levels of consciousness and perception. It outlines a series of steps, from observing oneself in silence to developing a sense of presence and clarity, and ultimately reaching a state of lucid dreaming while awake. The author draws on various traditions, including Tibetan and Egyptian, and provides detailed instructions for each stage of the practice. The final 200 tokens focus on the third stage, in which the operator transcends to a dream world and must fight to maintain awareness and avoid getting lost in hallucinations. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a state of perfect lucidity and walk between two worlds.",
  "content": "After, in this superior state the sensation of vertigo could even be voluntarily increased in intensity and be brought to a superior level, near to the loss of consciousness. THIRD STAGE - LUCID DREAMING IN WAKING STATE (??) If you are able to be present you will be able to reach a further step. In this step you will become aware at the same time of two realities and you will be beyond the normal ego, above the flow of dreaming thoughts that are created by your abitual being. Those who are able to overcome the point in which they risked to succomb to the vertigo and be carried over by the flow of dreams, they will be like walking above the waters. In fact, passing beyond the threeshold of this \"death\" they may, after a barrage of trials, get even used to the vertigo itself and not suffer it, rather almost no notice at all, and therefore lead with perfect lucidity the gap between the two modes of being, leaving the physical body in a state of apparent death to live another life, and then regain consciously the primitive state. You will stay on two worlds at the same time.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises described in this text may lead to a state of lucid dreaming in the waking state and ultimately to an identity with the cosmic consciousness. The exercises involve looking at oneself in the mirror, working with the elements, and creating basic analgesia. Progressively, the practitioner can go beyond the ordinary self and reach a deeper, higher self. It is important to note that these exercises need to be done gradually with control and purpose as they can induce strange, unordinary states of consciousness. Nonetheless, with time and practice, one may overcome fear and transcend into a state of ecstasy and beyond."
