  "title": "What is ESSENCE and how does it relate to the concept of individual soul in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of ESSENCE, initially perceived as an empty lack within the physical body but actually full of Essential qualities. ESSENCE is the Fifth Dimension of awareness and often referred to as an \"individual soul,\" but it is actually a condensation of the ONE GREAT SOUL or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. The last 200 tokens explain that at the level of this void, there is no \"individual soul,\" only the BIG EMPTINESS, which can be imagined as ice cubes placed in a bathtub made of the same substance as the water.",
  "content": "It should also be noted that Gautma the Buddha's realization led him to and beyond the Hindu Yoga experience of transmigration, (a separate individual soul or atma) which incarnates again and again. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology To best explain this, it can be said that ESSENCE carries with it a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, and with that condensation. the \"characteristics\" of that particular \"piece\" of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS with its memories and consciousnesses, etc. We might \"think\" or imagine that an \"individual\" soul exists at the level of ESSENCE, but to go beyond we must realize that at the level of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, there is no \"individual soul\" only the BIG EMPTINESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. To illustrate, imagine ice cubes placed in a bathatub as made of the same substance as the water in the tub. In the same way, water (EMPTINESS) in a bath tub could become solid (ice) and thin-out to become water in different areas within the tub.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of individual soul and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is crucial when exploring spirituality and consciousness. Gautma the Buddha's realization led him beyond the Hindu Yoga experience of transmigration, which influenced the development of Buddhism. Recognizing that ESSENCE is the last state that has qualities beyond the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS helps us comprehend the nature of existence, consciousness, and spirituality beyond quantum psychology."
