  "title": "\"What is the power of the eye and how can we develop it for charisma, leadership, and healing?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this book, we learned about the extraordinary power of the eye and how it can influence human behavior and thought. We examined the importance of a person's appearance and how it can shape others' opinions of them. In this final part, we will explore how we can develop and train our ability to use the power of our look consciously. By doing so, we can subjugate these energies and enchant whoever looks at us, creating an instantaneous hypnosis. This book is the world's most comprehensive text on this subject, drawing from practical experience and extensive research.",
  "content": "For sure, speech helps fashion ideas and beliefs, but what happens when such action is not validated by one’s look? When one listens to a person without seeing him, the content of what he is saying is only understood by creating some mental images, imaginary mental images. Words gain in potency when they are backed up by the look. A proficient orator deliberately trains the way he looks at the audience in order to lend greater force and persuasive efficacy to his verbalizations. In the course of this book, we shall discover how such a force is susceptible of being developed by recourse to a self-disciplining method. Indeed, already when we limit ourselves to looking around without any specific purpose, even without any specific instructions, we are in fact communicating a myriad of different messages. If, however, we develop conscious awareness of what we do, we will manage to ultimately learn how to subjugate these energies possessed by the look. Indeed, in extreme circumstances, the ability we will have gained thereby is going to extend, in the sphere of interpersonal relationships, to the power to “enchant” whoever watches us, to create “an instantaneous hypnosis”; at the same time, from the viewpoint of the receptive side of looks, we will understand and perceive many more things than those we would otherwise regard as possible. The present work is the world’s most profoundly comprehensive text on this subject. It has its roots both in practical experience and in the attentive study of all the relevant literature we have been able to lay our hands on.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the look can be developed and harnessed through conscious awareness and disciplined self-training. Fascination through the eye has been utilized for centuries, but the true method of mastering this technique has been kept secret, until now. With the help of exercises and a different vision of reality, one can develop the power of their eyes to enhance their presence, status, and leadership. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and it is important to use this technique for positive, development-oriented purposes. By creating mental images through speech and backing them up with the power of the look, one can become a proficient orator and enchanter of those who watch them."
