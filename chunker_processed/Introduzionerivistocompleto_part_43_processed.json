  "title": "What is the connection between hypnosis and self-hypnosis, and what happens in our brain during these states?",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text delves deeper into the concept of self-hypnosis and hypnotic techniques, dispelling myths about their inexplicability and outlining their benefits. In self-hypnosis, we learn to control our emotions and thoughts by distracting the left hemisphere of the brain using autosuggestion. The section discusses different hypnotic communication models and provides an introduction to the Erickson model for inducing a state of profound relaxation. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of imagination, relaxation, and concentration in achieving our goals and creating a positive state of mind.",
  "content": "“Imagination is more important than knowledge” (Einstein) “The mind is comparable to a butterfly that takes on the colour of the leaf on which it is resting...you become what you envisage”. (Gustave Flaubert) Above all, it is important to learn how to relax and concentrate and not to allow ourselves to be distracted, focusing our attention inside ourselves. At the beginning, this may seem difficult but then you will see unexpected results. You will feel a sensation of order in your mind and the ability to manage your thoughts without them managing you. Your mind will become your kingdom and you will be the king. THINK ABOUT A LAKE: when the surface is calm it’s easy to see the bottom. However, when the lake is choppy with waves you cannot see anything. The same thing happens to the mind: it can only read inside you when it is calm! AN AUTOSUGGESTIVE EXCERCISE AFTER SELF HYPNOSIS HAS BEEN ACTIVATED Relax. Identify something that you would like to obtain, create or achieve; it can be a job, an internal change, improved health or an approved appearance. To start with, choose an objective that is easy to believe in. Create a mental image, think about the present, as if it already exists, in exactly the way you want it. Place yourself in the exact situation which you desire. Enrich your mental image with specific emotions, making it as real as possible. Give positive energy to the objective; make positive assertions to yourself, saying that your objective exists.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of our minds is immense and can be harnessed through techniques like hypnosis, autogenous training, and NLP to achieve our goals, improve our well-being, and even change our perception of reality. By learning to relax, focus our attention, and communicate with our subconscious mind, we can achieve unexpected results and become the kings of our own minds. As Einstein said, imagination is more important than knowledge, and with the help of these techniques, we can tap into the power of our imagination and create our own reality."
