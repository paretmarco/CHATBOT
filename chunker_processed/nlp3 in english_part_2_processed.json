  "title": "What is a Logical Level and How Does NLP 3 Enhance Hypnosis, Sales, Relationships, Therapy, and Personal Development?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the concept of logical levels is explained as a way of analyzing reality. The focus is on NLP 3, which is the outcome of many years of modeling successful communicators who operated at different logical levels compared to traditional NLP. NLP 3 emphasizes learning to be a Neurolinguistic Programmer rather than just doing NLP. It offers a renewed way of teaching NLP, with an emphasis on integrating techniques for easy implementation in various contexts. All this leads to greater awareness of the various processes in action and improving personal development.",
  "content": "NLP 3 is the outcome of many years of modeling. The modeled people used effective communication models and all had succes in their lifes; most of them knew already traditional NLP, but judged it “too slow” or “unhuman” and they then had developed models that didn’t enter in the traditional NLP schemes. The analysis started from the fact that NLP is a methodology, not a technique. We have then examined the operational models of such people and we have discovered that they all operated a different manner of analysis of reality. It means they operated at a different logical levels compared to the traditional schools of NLP: they —unconsciously— used NLP 3. What does NLP 3 offer me ? Emphasis in NLP 3 doesn’t fall on DOING Neurolinguistic Programming, instead it falls on learning to BE a Neurolinguistic Programmer. Our way of teaching NLP has been renewed, bringing the student to interiorize a serie of microabilities that lead to a superior awareness of the various processes in action. Emphasis has been set on the integration of the various techniques of NLP for an easy implementation of them in a wider operative context (Sale, Negotiation, Therapy, Relations, Personal Development, etc.).",
  "last_phrase": "NLP 3 offers a new way of learning to be a Neurolinguistic Programmer rather than just doing the techniques. By integrating new elements such as pre-verbal symbolism, olfactory and gustatory cues, and non-verbal hypnosis, NLP 3 complements and amplifies traditional NLP, making it more effective in various fields such as sales, negotiation, therapy, and personal development. Multisensory hypnosis, which involves the use of non-verbal elements such as paralinguistic, prossemic, kinesic, and digital, offers incredible therapeutic possibilities and can be useful for hypnotherapists, researchers, and even people in the sales field."
