  "title": "\"What is the Crystal Palace and its Connection to the Graal? Understanding Energy and Consciousness Levels.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, we explore the concept of the Crystal Palace in eastern traditions, which connects the pineal and pituitary glands and awakens energy. The text delves into the three gates of the temple of Solomon, which are different levels of consciousness. We also learn about Perceval's encounter with a white splendid woman in the forest and how illusory attachments can create tempests within us when we change levels. The exercise described at the end of the text opens up the way to a magnetic energy connected to the body and helps us access higher levels of consciousness. Finally, the text concludes by discussing the biology of Kundalini, which sheds light on how transcendental vision occurs.",
  "content": "“During initiation of the Crystal Palace hormones including oxytocin and vasopressin are released from the pituitary into the blood stream to facilitate the metamorphic birth. The fact that the nerves and blood vessels that feed the eyes and middle ear pass through the cavernous sinus either side of the sphenoid sinus leads us to speculate on the mechanisms behind both Celestial Music that is heard when the Crystal Place is lit up, and changes in the eyes such as light emerging from them, changes of consciousness seen in the eyes and faculty of transcendental vision itself. When the Crystal Chamber is lit transcendental vision occurs. Transcendental vision probably occurs due to increased kundalini flow raising dopamine and phenylethylamine etc...All kind of changes happen in the retinas and occipital lobes, including increased ATP production acting as a neurotransmitter and histamine increasing blood flow in the brain, and increase in nitric oxide metabolism. The end result being that one has an increase in visual acuity, inner visions, inner lights, seeing auras and vivid dreams. If you try the drug Ecstasy you are likely to see auras, and have transcendental vision so there must be some similarity in the chemical mechanism between Ecstasy and kundalini.” (Biology of Kundalini)",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the initiation of the Crystal Palace leads to the release of hormones and the activation of various mechanisms that initiate transcendental vision, resulting in increased visual acuity, aura sightings, and vivid dreams. The phenomenon of Celestial Music and the changes in the eyes and middle ear might also be linked to this process. The effects of transcendental vision align with those of drugs like Ecstasy, suggesting a possible chemical mechanism similarity. Explore this fascinating area of biology to better understand the depths of human consciousness."
