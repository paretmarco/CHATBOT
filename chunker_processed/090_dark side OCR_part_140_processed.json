  "title": "What is Illusioning and How Can We Remedy It?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author talks about the concept of illusioning, which is when people subjectively interpret situations or people based on their own needs. The author then talks about a personal experience where his energy was perceived differently by two individuals. The therapist felt threatened and thus labeled his energy as aggressive, while another doctor wanted to meditate with him and thus labeled his energy as great. The author then suggests that to remedy illusioning, individuals must take responsibility for their own feelings and do a reality check with others to determine if they are indeed illusioning. The goal in therapy, according to the author, is to understand that the child within is illusioning.",
  "content": "The inner child can illusion and project it on a situation or person, and subjectively make it feel as though it is true. Each inner child determined his experience of my energy through his own needs. This is a form of illusioning, feeling what is not there, seeing and defining things as we need them to be seen and defined. My first teacher was the noted industrial psychologist Dr. Frederick Herzberg. Herzberg would sum it up this way, \"We define things the way we need them to be defined.\" Remedy of illusioning: Check it out with the other person. A reality check to see where the other person is coming from helps to determine if you are illusioning. This requires, however, a willing- ness to take responsibility for your trance-ferred feelings. It also requires you to look at yourself, rather than at another, as the creator of your experience. A goal in therapy is to understand that the child within is illusioning. Look at it developmentally. In the case where the woman was to become Christ, the illusion of the child within began as the adult described her illusions. She began to look young, three or four years old.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of illusioning and how our inner child can project illusions onto situations and people is crucial for personal growth. The remedy for illusioning is to check it out with the other person and take responsibility for the feelings we transfer. Looking at ourselves as the creators of our experience instead of blaming others is key. Recognizing when our inner child is illusioning and addressing it developmentally can help us to overcome limiting beliefs and manifest a more fulfilling reality."
