  "title": "How does transpersonal co-dependency and spiritualization impact one's perception of needs and wants?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of transpersonal co-dependence, where one seeks to please and serve others (parents, gurus, religious systems) in order to be taken care of. This behavior is traced back to childhood where the child interprets their parent's responses to their desires as indications of God's decision to give them what they need. The last 200 tokens delve into the role of gurus and spiritual systems in perpetuating this co-dependence, with the vulnerable disciples taking on the parent role in the hopes of being taken care of in return. It highlights the abuse of power that often occurs in such relationships as the guru manipulates their followers while masquerading as their spiritual guide.",
  "content": "This is a story of a child who gives up her self to take care of her parents in order to be taken care of herself. A child brought up in an alcoholic family might clean-up Dad' s bottle of booze, thinking that' s taking care of him so that she will be taken care of. Years later, if it trance-fers to God (transpersonal co-depen- dence), the child within might become a disciple of a guru. The philosophies match: I'll serve the guru, so he will take care of me. Notice how often gurus and religious systems abuse their vulner- able disciples sexuality and emotionally. It appears to the child Spiritualizing + 137 within the disciple that he is serving, but actually the guru is manipulating, playing out the parent side of the identity, getting people to take care of him in the name of spirituality. This is called service. People in spiritual circles say things like, \"I just want to serve God.\" Translated, \"I want to take care of Mom and Dad, so I will get taken care of.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize the patterns of transpersonal co-dependence and spiritualization in order to break free from the manipulations and abuses that can come with them. By becoming aware of these dynamics, we can heal from our past traumas and take responsibility for our own well-being, rather than relying on others to take care of us. Remembering that we too are powerful and capable individuals can free us from the belief that we must give up ourselves in order to be taken care of by others."
