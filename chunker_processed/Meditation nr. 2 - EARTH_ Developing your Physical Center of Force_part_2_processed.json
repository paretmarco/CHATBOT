  "title": "What is the significance of the \"Hara\" and the Enteric Nervous System in personal power and well-being?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of Hara, the power center under the navel in martial arts, was discussed, along with an exercise to activate another secret power center, corresponding to the sexual glands. It was also mentioned that when riding a horse, the Hara of the rider connects with that of the horse, and the benefits of being centered on the Hara were highlighted. This section delves into the symbolism of the black knight and the woman who has put him under a hypnotic spell, representing how people can become prisoners of their compulsions and desires. The discussion is centered around the initiatic Celtic mystery tradition of Perceval, and how accessing one's inner \"tomb\" can lead to true freedom.",
  "content": "Because connecting to this center of force is a way of increasing also one’s health If you practise magnetism, you will be stronger If you fight and you are centered on the “Hara” you will be stronger If somebody try to block you and you are centered on the “Hara” he will not be able to do it From the “Hara” energy goes up and you can take the vertical Chivalry of the Graal We must get out from the conditioning. Years and lifetimes of wounding have been cemented over through oppression and repression of the ability to fully feel our emotions. So the trauma gets stuffed down as a way to survive, cemented over but never fully healed. The black knight lives in a tomb. But accessing this tomb we can recover freedom Perceval - Initiatic Celtic Mystery Tradition If you take the average person in life, he is a prisoner even if he thinks to be free. Prisoner of his compulsions, prisoner of his desires. He knows no more where is his center. Staying outside from our center we are as prisoner And we repeat again and again the same action The black knight is the third encounter. The black knight is a strong fighter. He lives inside a tomb. A woman in some way has captured him and put him under a sort of hypnotic spell where he stays forever This pretty woman is the symbol of appearances. The black knight had lost.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, accessing the center of force and connecting with the ENS can lead to increased physical and emotional health. By freeing ourselves from conditioned patterns of behavior, we can break free from the enslavement of our compulsions and desires. The black knight symbolizes our inner battles, and by accessing the deeper center through practices like magnetism and chivalry, we can win these battles and achieve stability. The ENS plays a significant role in regulating the gut and affects various bodily functions. Exploring this system could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the connection between physical and mental health."
