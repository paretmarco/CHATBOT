  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this excerpt from \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" Wolinsky and Sylvia discuss their beliefs about light, with Sylvia admitting that she used to believe that light was enlightenment and that dark was bad. However, she has since realized that these are just concepts. Wolinsky guides her through a therapeutic exercise, asking her to separate concepts like light and GOD from her own essence, and to consider how her experience would change if she did so. Ultimately, Sylvia discovers that her beliefs about light and dark are just concepts, and that her true essence is beyond them.",
