  "title": "How can the Quantum Psychology Principle help someone dealing with an abusive spouse and shared valuables?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of multi-dimensional awareness in the context of Quantum Psychology. The author recounts a conversation with a woman whose husband was being abusive and attempting to take their shared valuables. The author suggests the principle of meeting the problem at the level of the problem and on an external level, hiring a lawyer. The following section discusses the Quantum Psychology Principle that what is true in one level of awareness may not be true at another level. The author also outlines the different dimensions of awareness and their functions, with a focus on the external dimension of manifestation. This section illustrates how confusing levels of awareness can lead to misunderstanding and pain, and underscores the importance of developing functional awareness.",
  "content": "What I have seen is that any habitual fixation of awareness in any dimension creates an experiential limitation from the full spectrum of humanity. One of the purposes of Quantum Psychology, therefore, is to develop a functional awareness. This means that in the beginning stages, while awareness is still there, developing the ability to place awareness in any dimension. To paraphrase, noted Sufi Master Indries Shah, \"In order to be free, we must be able to gain choice over where we place our awareness.\" SUMMARY OF THE DIMENSIONS Please note, the line connects all dimensions showing that they are connected and influence each other; however, they do have different functions: The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness CHAPTER V THE EXTERNAL DIMENSION OF MANIFESTATION \"You never put your foot in the same river twice\" DIMENSION I: THE EXTEINAL WORLD A t first glance, we would say, \"Oh, that's easy. Just be aware of what's happening around you.\" The ability to experience the external is to see people, situations, objects, etc., without using your thoughts, memories, emotions, associations or perceptions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a functional awareness through multi-dimensional consciousness is essential to overcome our experiential limitations and expand our perception beyond the external dimension of manifestation. By gaining control over where we place our awareness, we can avoid going into a trance and losing touch with the present reality. Remember, the external world is just one of the interconnected dimensions, and understanding it in its fullness can help us navigate life with more clarity and purpose."
