  "content": "We are thus the ones in need of being freed. Most people have an obstructed mental structure which has become fixed in habits and actions which their subconscious dictates. Accordingly, they consume their time in activities that are devoid of a link to their true being. These people, now and then, might even take some good resolutions, but it is as if they subsequently forgot they had ever taken them. As a result, they incessantly reiterate the same things, and forever tread the same path. Instead of living life, these people are lived by it. This category of persons, quite simply, cannot attain the results they wish for themselves, because, while not even being aware of it, they block their vital energy. That is the reason why they find it so hard to attain results and succeed. If we are making too much effort, we ought to pause and reflect: What truly matters is what we do. How can we steer our vital force? This method leads you to re-establish the correct structure of life and being. Exercise 1 â€“ Questions: Which of my daily actions bring me closer to what I want?",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to truly live life and attain the results we desire, we must re-establish the correct structure of our being and steer our vital force towards actions that bring us pleasure and closer to our goals. By taking control of our time through self-presencing, we can attain all types of freedoms and break free from the obstructed mental structure that holds us back. Remember, what truly matters is what we do, and with reflection and conscious effort, we can live life to its fullest."
