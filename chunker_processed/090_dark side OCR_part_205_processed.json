  "title": "\"What are the effects of childhood survival strategies on adult relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the cognitive and behavioral strategies that individuals develop in response to dysfunctional situations, particularly abuse. The first level of development involves the child's attempts to protect themselves from feeling powerless by creating the belief that they are in charge or powerful. As adults, this can result in emotional rigidity and a lack of vulnerability. The second level of development is \"idealizing,\" where the child creates perfect versions of their dysfunctional parents as a coping mechanism. This helps them avoid facing the chaos and terror of their situation.",
  "content": "The developing infant re-enforces her cognitions, beliefs, and strategies in an attempt to organize her world. More simply put, when facing her dysfunctional situation, the child employs survival strategies to defend herself from the fear of annihilation. Second Level Processes The second level of development is \"idealizing.\" The develop- ing child creates his parents as ideals, in order to avoid facing the terror of death, chaos, or annihilation. For example in a house where one or both parents are dysfunctional, the child does not have the strength to face the chaos which he views as possible death through neglect or abuse. The observer has the child go into a trance to not feel, not see, or not know what the situation is. The observer creates the child idealizing the parents and creates them as perfect. This helps the child resist the chaos of seeing them as dysfunctional and provides him with a strategy to handle his own internal chaos. If he saw his parents' dysfunction, it would be too horrifying; so ideali- zation seems like the only sane path.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to acknowledge the impact of early childhood experiences on our current relationships. By understanding our survival strategies, such as idealizing, we can begin to recognize patterns of behavior that may hinder our ability to see our partners as they truly are. By doing so, we can work towards healthier and more fulfilling relationships."
