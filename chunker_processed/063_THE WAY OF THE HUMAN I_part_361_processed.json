  "title": "How can breaking trance-ference and de-idealizing help develop multi-dimensional awareness and humanity in therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the importance of breaking the trance-ference and narcissism in therapy. She emphasizes that without de-idealization of the other and the realization of our own humanness, there can be no freedom or humanity. The author shares her own experience of being an incest survivor and attending Incest Survivors Anonymous group. She emphasizes the need for therapists to break the trance-ference of idealization by having the client place an image of the idealized other next to the therapist and notice the similarities and differences. This approach is discussed in detail in Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "This can be accomplished by having the client place an image of the idealized other next to the therapist and notice the similarities and differences.2 This leads to differentiating the past from the present. This is discussed in detail in Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology. 233 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness A major breakthrough in the Way of the Human is to realize that you, the therapist, and everyone else are human beings. This creates the experience of compassion and humanity. Without the dissolution of trance-Terence and narcissism, and the trance-ference processes of merger, twinship, mirroring, idealization and spiritualization, there can be no freedom or humanity which only comes through de-idealizing of the other (not as a put down) and the realization of our own humanness. How powerful is this experience of humanity? In the early 1980s, I realized that I was an incest survivor. At that time, there was only one Incest Survivors Anonymous group in New Mexico and sometimes I'd be the only one there. I can still recall the first time I went.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, realizing our shared humanity and dissolving the trances of idealization and narcissism is essential for true freedom and compassion. This can be achieved through techniques such as noticing similarities and differences between ourselves and others, as discussed in books like Trances People Live by Stephen Wolinsky. By breaking down the illusion of separation, we can connect more deeply with ourselves and others, and experience a more fulfilling and rewarding existence."
