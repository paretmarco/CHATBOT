  "title": "\"How can Quantum Psychology help you let go of negative thoughts and emotions?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part, Quantum Psychology is explored further, with the concept of growing one's awareness of ESSENCE. The author asks the reader to split their awareness into three parts: their Essential Core, False Core, and the room around them. Through this exercise, the False Core's desire to disappear is explored, leading to a peachy pink feeling of nothingness. The author encourages the reader to pay attention to their experiences as they emerge. Overall, the text highlights the importance of awareness and understanding in letting go of emotional baggage.",
  "content": "How are you doing? I feel this space of my Essential Core. It is amazing. DEMONSTRATION #2 I am also having a problem with this. Notice your False Core. And notice all the energy which that False Core has. Notice the different chains of association that come off the False Core. Now, notice the BIG EMPTINESS the False Core is floating in. Now, ask the False Core, \"What is it that you are seeking more than anything else in the world.\" What does it say? It disappeared. Okay, let's stay with that. So what I am going to ask you to do as we go on is to pay attention to the experience that emerges rather then doing any figuring out. Just notice what emerges as we continue. So now if it disappeared, what would that feellike? I just get this peachy pink color. What does that feel like? It feels okay. So ask the False Core, what is it that you seek by disappearance. If it were to disappear and be peachy, what would that feel like? Nothing. And what does that feel like? Notice your experience that is emerging.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to pay attention to the experiences that emerge within ourselves rather than trying to figure out our emotions. By noticing the different cores within us and the energy they bring, we can work towards achieving a state of lightness and freedom. Remember to notice what emerges and embrace the feeling of being free and light. How are you feeling now?"
