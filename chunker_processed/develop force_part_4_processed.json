  "title": "\"Can you learn the power of the eye? Understanding the ancient art of fascination through self-discipline.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of the eye as a tool for developing presence, charm, charisma, and leadership. It draws from historical and scientific sources and discusses how a deliberate use of the eyes can influence and hypnotize others. The last 200 tokens examine the origins of this tradition and how it has been passed down from master to disciple across centuries, particularly in Italy. The text also discusses the need for a different approach to reality and a different vision to actively employ the power of the eyes. The text is inspired by encounters with the last fascinators, particularly Virgilio T. 2, who is the last custodian of some of the secrets of this ancient practice.",
  "content": "In order to lend efficacy to this force, it is essential for us to develop awareness of the strength inherent in our look, as well as to develop a different vision. Though this is a practically orientated tradition, in order to understand and, even more, to put this art into practice, what is indeed required is an approach to reality which opens up to different and all-encompassing dimensions. They have to differ, in other words, from the linear and limited dimension of modern man. For modern man, the eye is a mere passive organ. If we, however, desire to appropriate the power inherent in the eye, we have to actively employ it and draw close to quantistic physics, which teaches us precisely that “the observer influences the observed”. In fascination we detect transformation, both the transformation of the one who actively inspires it and the one who is the passive recipient thereof. Fascination is additionally able to confer a scientific basis on the otherwise inexplicable thereapeutic ability possessed by several healers. The original sources of our interest in the subject Everything originated at first in our odd encounter with “the last of the fascinators”: Virgilio T. 2, who currently lives in a state of deliberate obscurity by the valleys of Piedmont. He appears to be the last custodian of one part of the secrets of this most ancient school.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing awareness and control over the power inherent in our look can unlock the ancient technique of fascination, also known as instantaneous hypnosis. Through disciplined self-work and specific exercises, we can harness the power of our gaze to captivate and influence others, both in everyday life and within the therapeutic field. This technique has a long and storied history, with healing power attributed to the look since ancient times. By mastering this art, we can open doors to new opportunities and even help others in need."
