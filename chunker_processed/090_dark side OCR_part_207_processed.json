  "title": "\"How does the inner child affect adult relationships and power dynamics in women?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the complex relationships between our inner child and adult selves, and how they can impact our relationships. The previous paragraphs describe how the inner child may idealize a spouse, either by only seeing their potential or building them up to feel good about themselves. However, this can lead to the present time adult giving up their own power and lessening themselves. The following 200 words delve into the impact of societal norms on women, and how mothers may inadvertently teach their daughters to hide their power. The author contends that this societal pressure contributes to the problem of repressed power, a frequent theme in women's workshops. The text ends with a quote from John Lennon and Yoko Ono, highlighting the power dynamics at play in relationships.",
  "content": "In this case the child within who is idealizing gives up her own power or, worse yet, pretends she doesn't have any. This child-like position gives others power and claims none for itself. Women and Power ...we insult them everyday on T.V. ...and wonder why they have no guts or confidence ...when they are young we kill their will to be free ...by telling them not to be smart and then put them down for being dumb. \"Women Are the Nigger's of the World' John Lennon inspired by Yoko Ono Spiritualizing 46 131 fragile a man' s ego is, so she builds him up as an ideal. This makes her and him feel more secure. This trance keeps her relationship but at the price of hiding her own power and brilliance. In many cases she pretends she's not as smart as he, to the point she forgets she is pretending. Many times, mothers teach their daughters to not be powerful. Since, in our society this is taught and re-enforced, the inner child within a woman hides its power. In workshop after workshop, women are continually presenting the problem of re- pressed power.",
  "last_phrase": "It is time for women to reclaim their power and confidence. Let us break this debilitating and limiting pattern of idealizing men while hiding our own brilliance. We must stop insulting women on TV and in society, and encourage young girls to be confident and intelligent. By doing so, we can create a world where women no longer feel like second-class citizens and instead own their rightful place in society."
