By focusing on the client's body sensations as she shuts down, therapists can identify and alter these phenomena to help clients overcome symptoms like non-orgasmic experiences. Rather than only focusing on trauma content, understanding the present trance states and addressing them in a variety of ways can help bring healing and resolution."
