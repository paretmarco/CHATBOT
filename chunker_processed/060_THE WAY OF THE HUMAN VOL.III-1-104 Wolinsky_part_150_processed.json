  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author delves into the concept of vastness and the self. By fusing together the idea of the dark, empty label, the author resists the vastness and decides that it is not part of the self. They reverse the concept, making the \"I am alone\" the NOT-I and the \"vastness\" the \"I\".

The author invites the reader to imagine being in the big emptiness and then separating from the mother to realize their own separateness from her.",
  "content": "Stop doing it. Now, reverse it. Make the \"I am alone\" the NOT-I and the \"vastness\" the \"I.\" That's really the way it is. Okay. How are you feeling? Okay.

It's time to stop this thought pattern now and reverse it. Embrace the vastness and make it the \"I.\" You are one with everything, and there is nothing to fear. Take a moment to reconnect with the vastness and realize the infinite possibilities available to you."
