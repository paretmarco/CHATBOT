  "title": "What is Exercise 13 in Mind Training and the Importance of Focused Attention?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is focused on the practice of concentration and attention to detail through exercises geared towards increasing the duration of the mind's focus. The last 200 tokens mentions the importance of staying present in the moment, avoiding distractions, and paying attention to current actions. The author also emphasizes the need for mental focus during exercises and avoiding worrying about the exercise's success in real-time as it could hamper the process. The text concludes with a call-to-action for daily practice to improve the mind's ability to concentrate on specific tasks. The text highlights concepts such as mental training, exercise implementation, and sensory perception.",
  "content": "An exercise is deemed to have been implemented perfectly so long as the brain’s attention has not been interrupted. It is thus clear that one cannot simultaneously implement an exercise properly while at the same time worrying as to whether the exercise is being carried out well. As soon as the mind poses itself that question, the exercise is ipso facto brought to an end thereby. Accordingly, the question, ‘Have I implemented this exercise correctly?’, will always be, and by its nature can never fail to be, a retrospective one, that is, a question relating to an exercise that has already been completed. Based on the foregoing, when you set out to work on a particular exercise, you should focus your thought on the exercise itself rather than on «the implementation of the exercise». The adept is warmly exhorted to ponder this sentence well, as the whole secret of successful accomplishment of the method is ensconced within its folds. On a daily basis Try and be present to what you do. Remove your thought from either the past or the future. Be in what you are busy doing.",
  "last_phrase": "To successfully complete any task or exercise, focus on the present moment and the task at hand without worrying about its outcome. Avoid switching abruptly from one thought to another and be fully attentive to everything you are doing. Remember that successful implementation of an exercise depends on keeping your mind present and attentive, so do not allow distractions to interrupt your attention."
