  "title": "What is The Way of the Human, and how does it help us discover who we are and connect with our unity?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author emphasizes the importance of embracing all aspects of our nature, including the animal and psycho-emotional parts, to connect to our underlying quantum nature and achieve multi-dimensional awareness. The author reflects on their past tendency to deny their animal and psychological nature through spiritual practices and the negative consequences that resulted from this division of self. The Way of the Human encourages us to appreciate and embody our entire being as a form of biological spirituality to connect with the unity of humanity. The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to guide us in the discovery of our true self, although no guarantees can be made.",
  "content": "In other words, I used spiritual philosophy to re-enforce the denial of the animal (biological) as well as the psychological. This self-defeating tendency to divide yourself by \"taking on\" psycho-spiritual belief systems, techniques, philosophies and identities has, more often than not, created more divisions externally, i.e., us and them, pd,internally, i.e., spiritual or higher parts trying to subdue \"lower\" parts and emotions. With this in mind, The Way of the Human asks us not to get rid of anything but to study and appreciate everything, not to destroy but to enjoy, not to disembody but to embody and be present. The Way of the Human starts with where you are as the link that connects to the underlying unity. Simply stated, to be human and embody is a form of biological spirituality. It is the way to connect to humanity, which is here and now and which is the underlying unity. The purpose of Quantum Psychology can be summarized as the development of multi-dimensional awareness as a vehicle that might help you discover WHO YOU ARE. Incidentally, I underlined might since there are no guarantees nor can an individual promise that there will be.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, The Way of the Human is a path towards multi-dimensional awareness that encourages us to appreciate and embody every aspect of ourselves as human beings. By studying and understanding our limitations, we can develop a deeper connection to our bodies and our surroundings. Through this biological spirituality, we can discover who we are and our underlying unity with humanity. It requires discipline and focused attention, but the journey itself is the reward."
