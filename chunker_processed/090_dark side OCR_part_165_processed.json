  "first_phrase": "In this section, the concept of witnessing and measuring confusion is explored. By repetitively asking questions about the confusion such as its shape, color, and effect on oneself, individuals can become aware of their role in creating it. This culture encourages individuals to \"get clear\" of confusion, but paradoxically, this only perpetuates it. By resisting the experience of confusion, individuals keep themselves in a trance. Instead, taking responsibility for the creation of confusion and being willing to experience it without trying to \"get clear\" can lead to personal growth.",
  "content": "Does it have a color? 5. Does it change how I feel about myself? 6. Does it change how I feel about the world? By repeating these questions again and again, the confusion is witnessed. 7. Notice that you are the observer and creator of the con- fusion. Conclusion In this culture individuals attempt to \"break through,\" \"get clear\" of their con-fusion. Paradoxically, trying to get clear resists the confusion. An I-dentity whose goal is to get clear is created. The most interesting facet of this resides in the \"getting clear\" process. The child resists experiencing the trance of confusion. Simply put, trying to \"get clear,\" \"understand,\" \"find out,\" or \"know,\" is a way the child within the adult resists confusion. Thus trying to get rid of the confusion keeps it present. This resistance to experiencing the experience of confusion, along with the label \"confusion is bad,\" keeps the trance frozen. Individuals can learn to take responsibility Con-fusion + 10) for the creation of confusion and become more willing to experience it without the resistance of trying to \"get clear.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing confusion rather than resisting it can lead to greater personal growth and a shift in perspective. Instead of trying to \"get clear,\" individuals can choose to be with the confusion intentionally and take responsibility for its creation. This allows for a shift in the trance state and the awakening of the observer and creator within oneself. Remember to observe the confusion, rather than becoming it, while asking yourself questions like \"Does it have a color?\" and \"Does it change how I feel about myself and the world?\""
