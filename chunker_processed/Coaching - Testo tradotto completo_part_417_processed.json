  "title": "What is the Higher Level of Presence and Self-Mastery and How Does it Relate to Power?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, the author delves deeper into the second level of presence, where emotions are replaced by a heightened level of attention and self-control. The hub of this level lies in the mastery of self, where a dual consciousness is developed, allowing for a greater level of effectiveness in achieving intended results. The author uses the analogy of driving a car at high speed to illustrate the concept. The section highlights the importance of self-awareness in achieving goals and transcending perceived limitations.",
  "content": "At the beginning, the path to the development of presence aims at being steeped, to an increasingly more more pronounced extent, in the dimensions of one's immediate sensory being. That has the effect of accentuating our level of vigilance and perception, thereby enabling us a greater extent of effectiveness. As for this higher level, we find that in it I am conscious both 1) of the fact I am speaking and 2) of what I am saying. In essence, therefore, I am being conscious at a dual level: I have in fact sensory consciousness of what I am doing (this represents the basic layer of presence, the one we have begun to develop through the exercises of the first part of this book), as well as consciousness of the meaning I confer upon things. An analogy one can draw for the sake of illustrating this concept is the one of a car: It is in fact like driving a car at a very high speed, when the driver pays attention to every thing and at the same he must, of course, know where he is heading for.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing presence requires us to cultivate sensory consciousness and the ability to confer meaning to our experiences. When we reach a higher level of presence, we become like a skilled driver who has both a strategy for success and an acute awareness of our surroundings. By honing our ability to be present in every moment, we can avoid living in isolated moments and take control of our lives to achieve our true desires."
