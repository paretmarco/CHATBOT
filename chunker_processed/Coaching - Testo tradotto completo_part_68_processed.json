  "title": "How can breaking free from habits lead us to true freedom and a fulfilling life?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the writer discusses the automatic mechanisms that divert one from oneself, which results in a loss of life and time. Man's thoughts and habits are the chains that fetter and despoil him of his own life. In the last 200 tokens, the writer explains that man's subordination to social dictates and enslaving career determined by others is one of the primary reasons for losing oneself. The preservation of a self-imposed social position and political party affiliation further deplete one's energy. Modern man is encircled in a barbed wire fence he cannot safely trespass, which limits his freedom to disengage or contradict himself.",
  "content": "Having a supine attitude to social dictates, which is a trait that begins as a mere outward approach and eventually turns into a way of thinking, is one of the first causes of what we mentioned. Man, who might be otherwise solely dependent on the natural elements, begins to fill up his existence, to encage himself in a social mechanism which he cannot escape from other than by breaching certain conventions that are deemed indispensable to the reputation of his entire caste. Thereafter, he bonds himself to an enslaving career which is determined by other people, and which tosses him this way or that way, while he remains at the mercy of someone else’s capricious whims. He subsequently attempts to confer on himself a “social position”, the preservation of which wears him out. Not happy with all of that, he then gives himself to some political party. Whichever side he turns to, modern man is encircled by a barbed wire fence he cannot trespass with impunity, without, that is, exposing his self to the risk of death. He lacks the freedom either to disengage or contradict himself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, breaking out of the bondage of habits is crucial for obtaining true freedom and living a fulfilling life. It's important to recognize that subservience to social dictates and conventions can be enslaving, preventing us from realizing our full potential. By breaking free from these routines, we can expand our horizons and experience life in all its abundance. Don't be like those who live merely by habit; be bold and break through that barbed wire fence, and truly live life to the fullest."
