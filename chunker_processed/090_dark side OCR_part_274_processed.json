  "title": "How can classical hypnosis be used to regulate acute pain sensations?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores different techniques for managing pain through self-trancing, focusing particularly on the classical approach to acute pain. The last 200 tokens suggest visualizing the nervous system like a computer room or switchboard to disconnect painful sensations from the ankle to the brain. The author references various sources, including Beck's Cognitive Therapy of Depression and Capra's The Tao of Physics, to provide context and support for their ideas. The text concludes with a reminder that self-trancing involves present-time choice, a stark contrast to inner child trances without choice.",
  "content": "In self-trancing, there is choice; in inner child trances, there is no choice. â€¢Bibliography American College Dictionary, New York: Random House. 1963. Beck, Aaron T., Rush, A.
