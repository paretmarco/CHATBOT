  "title": "\"How can we separate ourselves from our thoughts and observe them? A teaching by Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ramana Maharshi.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the concept of separating oneself from transient \"I\" thoughts is further explored. This is exemplified through a story of Nisargadatta Maharaj questioning the existence of the self and the identification with thoughts in relationships. The central teaching is to focus on the changeless space within oneself. The Thinking Dimension Exercise #2 is also introduced, encouraging the questioning of the origin of thoughts. This method helps to detach from transient thoughts and find a deeper sense of self-awareness.",
  "content": "For example, I'm angry with you because you're too tall or you're too short or I need less affection or I need more affection. So if I'm in a relationship with you, and I identify with the thought called \"I want you to be taller,\" you might say, \"Okay I'll wear high heels and do my hair up in a bun!\" When you buy into my thoughts of you, you may try to resist them as a way to a-void your False Core (Volume H). A basic teaching might therefore be stated as turning your attention to the changeless space that's always there. THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #2 Focus: When a thought arises, ask yourself, \"To whom does this thought arise?\" Answer: \"To me.\" Then ask, \"Who is this 'I' ?\" (Ramana Maharshi) One of the purposes of this method is to separate the transient \"I thoughts\" of the thinking dimension.",
  "last_phrase": "Practice this thinking dimension exercise to observe your thoughts objectively and separate the transient \"I thoughts\" of the thinking dimension. By turning your attention to the changeless space that's always there, you can see how thoughts impact your life and let go of them to construct a better reality for yourself."
