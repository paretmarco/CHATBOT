  "title": "\"What is Kairòs and how does it relate to the two times of man?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, Pittaco of Mytilene distinguishes between two distinct types of time: chronos (logical and planned time) and kairòs (the time of opportunities and joy of living). In the final 200 tokens, it is emphasized that both types of time coexist in humans, and that we must use chronos as a foundation to build upon in order to take advantage of kairòs when the right moment arises. It is essential to identify our primary commitment every day and prioritize accordingly. Many individuals procrastinate, but recognizing the appropriate moment is key to discovering genial opportunities.",
  "content": "The second such time is a time of energy and opportunities, a time for enjoyment and deriving the most that one can from life, which we might label kairòs. Both these times co-exist in man. Chronos (which is planned time) must manifest as a supporting platform that is capable of enabling kairòs (the time of opportunities and joy of living) to be exteriorized in turn, and also, if need be, to change chronos itself. Chronos: Time and chronological succession. It is ideally suited to the function of laying down the initial structure of an activity. At the start of every day, it will be appropriately opportune to pose to ourselves the question: — “Which is the most important commitment that looms ahead of me today?”. Moreover, if at the end of any day it will be shown that such a task has not been successfully fulfilled, that will be automatic proof of the fact that you have forgotten the motive behind your own activity. You must therefore pay a great deal of attention to such primary commitment, and work out your priorities around it. Many people read today, and yet they defer execution to the next day.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, we must understand that both Chronos and Kairòs times co-exist in us, and it is important to use Chronos as a supporting platform to enable the opportunities and joys of the Kairòs time. Therefore, it is crucial to focus and prioritize daily commitments and act upon them today rather than deferring them to an imaginary tomorrow, as today is all we have."
