  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author, Stephen, talks about his conversation with a patient regarding the different triggers associated with various fingers. He focuses on the trigger in the thumb, explaining that it has various meanings, depending on the context. In continuation, Stephen explains how stimuli in the environment can trigger certain responses, the way a movie director instructs actors to act a particular scene. In the last 200 tokens, Stephen talks about how a drug abuser came to him for his fourth session claiming that there is \"a lot more to work on.\"",
  "content": "It's just to pick things up.\" Stephen: \"So when she wants to pick up on you, you can feel it in the thumb?\" (new meaning for the trigger,) Patient:\"Yes.\" Stephen:\"I don't have to tell you that in America this means one thing; this gesture means some- thing else. In India this (waving good-bye) means hello. In America this gesture means good-bye. This gesture in India means, \"I want to go to the bathroom (using hand and finger gestures). This sign means \"I want to hitch- hike.\" So with each finger I differentiated the trigger into little, exact details. This expanded the meaning of the interpersonal trigger, which changed the trance. I created options experientially as to what this hand means. Basically, a stimulus in the environment (button) is like a movie director who says, \"Roll rejection scene, take #582.\" A drug abuser was seeing me. It was his fourth session. He has Appendix I â€¢ 163 no impulse for drugs. But he came and said, \"There is a lot more to work on.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to acknowledge that different cultural contexts and individual experiences can affect how we perceive and respond to triggers. By exploring these triggers in detail and creating multiple options for interpretation, one can expand their understanding and potentially change their psychological state. It's just a matter of picking things up and examining them from various perspectives."
