  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text explored an exercise called \"The Not I-I\" which aimed to resist the lack of definition by questioning assumptions about the self and the other. In this final section, the exercise continues with steps 1-4, but also goes \"Beyond Korzybski\" by recognizing that the nervous system organizes experience and the event level is not perceivable by it. Claudia finds the exercise expansive and spacious, suggesting a possible shift in perspective.",
  "content": "And to make sure that you fuse with everything around to reinforce that I?

  "last_phrase": "To fully align yourself with everything around you, attempt to fuse with your surroundings. Use this exercise, called \"Beyond Korzybski,\" to become more aware of the BIG EMPTINESS and label any identities as \"I.\" By acknowledging the nervous system as an abstraction of the Quantum world, you can connect with the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and transcend beyond quantum psychology."
