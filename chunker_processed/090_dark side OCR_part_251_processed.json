  "title": "Why do we resist emptiness? Insights from psychotherapy and the upcoming book \"The Tao of Chaos\".",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section of the text, The Tao of Chaos is center-stage where the author explains why we all resist nothingness. Through the real-life examples of a businessman and a woman medical doctor, the author showcases how resisting the \"void\" or \"no-thing-ness\" can lead to anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behavior. By accepting and allowing the void instead of resisting it, both individuals found peace and calm. As the author delves deeper into the relationship between chaos and nothingness, we gain a clearer understanding of the transformative power of embracing the void.",
  "content": "He no longer was resisting that void or chaos. Another example was a woman medical doctor who came to see me, suffering from obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behavior. This included everything from work to relationships. She sought my help because after having left her home at 19 to get married, and a divorce after 25 years of marriage, she had gotten immediately into another relationship. Now as this new relationship of four years was ending, she was in terror. Once again we processed through the identities and strategies of the past and present, but the terror still remained. Once again, I was struck by her resistance to the empti- ness, which she felt was always there as a threat. Her obsessive-compulsive tendency was a way to resist the void by trying to fill it up. We worked through the impossibility of filling up the void, and as she began allowing the emptiness rather than resisting it, the terror subsided. She felt calm and at peace. Further- more, in addition to the terror leaving and the obsessive-compulsive attempts to fill up the emptiness leaving, her fear of being alone, which was associated with the emptiness, also departed.",
  "last_phrase": "By learning to embrace the inner emptiness and resist the urge to fill it up, one can find peace and calm within oneself. In her journey of self-discovery and healing, the medical doctor in the example overcame her obsessive-compulsive behavior and fear of being alone. The author's upcoming book, The Tao of Chaos, explores this concept further, offering practical solutions for daily problems and encouraging readers to open themselves up to the unknown."
