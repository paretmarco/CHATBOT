  "title": "How does the nervous system translate Quantum experiences into our own consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text about Quantum Psychology, it was explained that the nervous system of our body transforms quantum experiences into our own experiences. The nervous system produces the \"I thought\" and hence, our psychology arises from the body, not the other way around. In the last 200 tokens, it is stated that the nervous system and the \"I\" thought cannot comprehend the void of undifferentiated consciousness from which it came. However, one can reach the Quantum level when the \"I thought\" disappears. This text emphasizes that the \"magic of words\" is not real and that different dimensions have an impact.",
  "content": "To \"think\" you can make changes in the external by changing words, beliefs, or mental pictures is to believe in the \"magic of words,\" which is a term used to denote how \"primitive people\" believe words are things. This can be demonstrated by a child who cries for food and is given food by mom. Soon the word \"food\" means the food (milk) itself. Though you obviously can't eat the word, still there is an understanding that the word food is food. Words are further from the sensation level and the nonverbal experience of I Am and occur in a different dimension and use a different part of the brain. Furthemore they are \"further away\" from the Quantum level. 6. The nervous system and the \"I\" thought cannot know the Quantum level of NOTHING/EVERYTHING. The I which is produced by the body/ nervous system which is a condensation of the Quantum level cannot know the VOID from which it came. However, \"YOU\" can know that Quantum level when the I thought begins to disappear or no longer arises.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, while words are important for communication, they are just symbols that represent real-world phenomena; they cannot fully capture the nonverbal experience of existence. By understanding the limitations of language and the nature of the \"I\" thought, we can begin to glimpse the Quantum level beyond space-time and expand our awareness."
