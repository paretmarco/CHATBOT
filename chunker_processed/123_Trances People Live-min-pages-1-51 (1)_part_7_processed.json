  "title": "\"How does Quantum Psychology explain the observer-created reality of our experience?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of Trances People Live, Dr. Wolinsky delves deeper into the understanding of experiencing oneself as the context for one's feelings. He then extrapolates this idea to a perspective of psychotherapeutic experience that includes both the therapist and patient identity as a unity. The book explores the concept of the therapist's integrity and how their interpersonal honesty and expression are central to their beingness. This book is a transcendental experience, and it's highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand life beyond the surface level. The section also references Nick Herbert's Quantum Reality and its influence on Quantum Psychology.",

One of these, the \"Copenhagen interpretation,\" is the Quantum Psychology. Herbert (1985) explains that: centerpoint of The Copenhagen interpretation properly consists of two distinct parts: (1)Thert is no reality in absence of observa- tion; (2) observation creates reality.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the discovery of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle has led to the emergence of various philosophical interpretations within the scientific community. The Copenhagen interpretation and Quantum Psychology highlight the active influence of the observer, demonstrating that reality is observer-created. This perspective encourages us to take a more active role in shaping our subjective experiences and understanding of the world around us."
