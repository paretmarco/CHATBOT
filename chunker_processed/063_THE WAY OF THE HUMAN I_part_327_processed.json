  "title": "What is the dissociative observer and how does it affect our sense of self and connection to humanity?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the developmental sequence of children and the creation of an individual self. It discusses how the dissociative observer emerges to protect against the loss of self and unmet biological needs. The author cites an example of a woman who disconnected from her present-time body and labeled it as spiritual, promoting herself as a guru. The last 200 tokens focus on Quantum Psychology principles regarding the dissociative observer, including the greater the fear of loss of self, the greater the power of the observer, and the greater the trauma or unmet needs, the more likely it is for the observer to appear. The author notes that dismantling the observer will be discussed in volume III of \"Beyond Quantum Psychology.\"",
  "content": "She said to me that she no longer felt sexual, that she was so spiritual now she had \"gone beyond\" sexual desire, not realizing sexuality is hard wired into the nervous system's survival of the species. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, a dissociative observer had emerged to defend against the pain and thus she lost her present-time body and her sexuality. She then labeled this process as spiritual. Also she had become grandiose by beginning to promote herself as a spiritual teacher/guru. This is the trance of the dissociative observer, who spiritualizes the dissociation which in this situation was created to defend against the pain of her relationship breaking up. Quantum Psychology has set aside several principles relating to the dissociative observer. (How to dismantle the observer will be discussed in Volume III, \"Beyond Quantum Psychology.\") 212 Special Section QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the fear of loss of self, the greater the power of the dissociative observer. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the trauma or the unmet biological needs of the child, the greater the tendency for a dissociative observer to emerge.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to understand that dissociative observation can lead to a loss of one's body and humanness, resulting in personal grandiosity and detachment from humanity. To dismantle the observer and reconnect with oneself and others, the principles of Quantum Psychology can be useful in addressing unmet needs and traumatic experiences."
