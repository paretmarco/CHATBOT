  "title": "\"What is the Coherence Field and How Does it Impact Our Ability to Communicate?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this chapter, the author further explores how exercises beyond just presence can help improve mental control and increase coherence in communication. The text also introduces the concept of the \"coherence field\" and how it plays a role in our perceptions of reality. The author suggests that by increasing our presence, we can create a denser coherence field, allowing us to assimilate others into our energy field. This information builds on previous exercises centered on presence and emphasizes the importance of mental control during communication.",
  "content": "Among the exercises which complement the development of presence in the action, we are finally going to mention even “distance attention”. What fundamentally occurs with it is that we are focused on the other person even when he is not there 108. If you are in this state, you will discover chains of concatenated events which are going to provide you with solutions. The concept of “Coherence Field” We do not truly perceive reality. All we do is to perceive one part of it. A key concept in the applied science of presencing, as well as in fascination, is the concept of the \"coherence field\". Every person creates a coherence field which extends between what he perceives of the external reality, his thoughts, and what he actively does. In our life, therefore, we define a “coherence field” on the strength of the coherence which is established between thoughts and mental direction. By increasing presence, we create a different, denser coherence field, and the other person, the one with whom we are dealing, can no longer control such coherence field. This other person comes in and becomes assimilated into our own energy field.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing presence through exercises like distance attention can lead to the creation of a denser coherence field, where thoughts and mental direction align, allowing for a greater control of one's own energy field. Understanding and utilizing the concept of the coherence field can bring a new level of awareness to various aspects of life, including in the realm of seduction."
