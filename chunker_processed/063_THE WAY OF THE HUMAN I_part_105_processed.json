  "title": "\"What is Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to the concept of the VOID and UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter II of \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the concept of the VOID universe is explored as parallel universe theory in physics. It is beyond perception and even conception of self. The NAMELESS is revealed when the VOID ends, but it is not to be confused with individual consciousness. The False Core and False Self Compensator are psycho-emotional abstractions that are explored in this map of Quantum Psychology, but ultimately must be looked and gone beyond.",
  "content": "To imagine that UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which has no awareness, no awarer and N04, creates, wants, prefers, has a will and volition—this is from the perspective of differentiated consciousness or a separate \"r which attributes human qualities of a nervous system, wanting, preferring etc.. onto UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which has no nervous system, this is anthropomorphic; where you project a nervous system onto something that does not have one. For example, Source wants this, Source likes that, or God wants this, the universe wants that, etc. None of these has a nervous system—but are projected onto by a Nervous System. 54 ________________ CONCLUSION EYOND QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY (VOLUME III) The False Core and False Self Compensator are a shorthand, a psycho-emotional abstraction, but ultimately this has to be looked and gone beyond. Another thing to keep in mind is that maps are made by people. Quantum Psychology is a map, and the map is not e territory. Or as the old Zen saying puts it, \"The finger that points the moon is not the moon.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology serves as a map that aims to uncover the real YOU by transcending the psycho-emotional abstractions of False Core and False Self Compensator to develop multi-dimensional awareness. However, it's important to remember that these maps are made by humans and, ultimately, the goal is to go beyond them to realize the underlying unity of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. While this may not be guaranteed, liberating your fixated awareness may enhance the probability of achieving this realization."
