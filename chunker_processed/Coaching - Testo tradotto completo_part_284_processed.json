  "title": "\"How Can Managing Energy Cyclical Improve Productivity and Efficiency?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the importance of managing our energy efficiently to achieve our daily objectives. Now, the focus is on energy management in a cyclical form to avoid exhaustion and optimize productivity. The author proposes two essential principles for effective energy management: the principle of oscillation and rhythm and the principle of effort. By alternating periods of activity with periods of rest and pushing beyond our limits, we can create capacity and increase efficacy. To apply these principles effectively, we need to examine the physical, mental and emotional dimensions of ourselves.",
  "content": "It is in other words important to define certain temporal moments in which we carry out some specific operation, with a view never to reaching breaking point. Two principles are essential in this regard: 1. The principle of oscillation and rhythm 2. The principle of effort The principle of oscillation: Nothing is constant in the world. Even as regards the energy field, it would be more correct to speak of “wave” and “flux”. One of the essential aspects consists in alternating periods of activity with periods of rest. In order to maintain a strong energy, we inevitably need to learn how to spend our energy rhythmically. Energy which is managed cyclically (alternation) is far stronger than linear energy (concentration without any rest). The principle of the effort: In order to create capacity and to acquire ever greater efficacy, we must transcend our ordinary limit, the way athletes do, and to subsequently grant ourselves some periods of rest. In order to apply this principle of oscillation effectively, it might be useful to work in a “multidimensional” way, by examining the physical, mental and emotional dimensions of man.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the principles of oscillation and effort, we can manage our energy cyclically, which is far stronger than linear energy. To apply these principles effectively, it is helpful to work in a multidimensional way, examining the physical, mental, and emotional dimensions of ourselves. By paying attention to our cycle of activity and rest, utilizing our mind's higher faculties, and transcending our limits, we can maintain a strong and efficient energy level without reaching a breaking point."
