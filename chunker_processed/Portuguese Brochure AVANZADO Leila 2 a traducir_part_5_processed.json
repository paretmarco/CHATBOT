  "content": "Let us instead hold onto the fact that men speak to avoid thinking: we talk a lot in order to say nothing. Great initiates that preceded us have always refused to let themselves be distracted by the noise of words. Convinced that the inner practice teaches mankind those things of the greatest interest to us, they founded Schools based on the power of Silence. At these schools a disciple is not lectured in the habitual way; he is put in the presence of his own self with a particular symbolic technique where he will feel the pure displays of being. We use still now in our school these symbols. Symbols we use, are simple graphic signs, basic geometrical figures. In order to uncover their potential, paretian original mesmerism and mind enchantment are the methods we have to block the continous noise of the mind and unleash the inner energy. So we can delve down into our own selves, going right to the bottom of the symbolic pool where the pure divinity of ourself hides its real power. But withdrawal into oneself is no more than a transitory exercise; it is not an end. After delving inside oneself one has to come out, one has to rise above things in order to then come back to them. And this key will bring real transformation in our life. These powerful methods will be in our next seminars. Uso das Técnicas 1) Torne-se um profissional usando as técnicas não verbais e mesméricas ou melhore suas habilidades se você já é profissional.",
