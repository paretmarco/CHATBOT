  "title": "\"Can Hypnotism Lead to Real Crime? Insights from a Hypnotist's Experiments and Views\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is an account of the mesmerizing experiments carried out by the French hypnotist, Professor Li√©beault, including his performances in Ostende and Milan, and his experiments in Yassy, Romania, and Paris. The text explores the power of suggestion in inducing various states of body and mind. The Professor explains that while he can create the illusion of a crime, hypnotism is not powerful enough to make someone commit a real crime. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves deeper into the power of suggestion in inducing dental pain and crime. The formidable question that arises is whether it is possible to bring about a real crime in real life, to which the author responds with an emphatic no.",
  "content": "To the subjects, who had just been giving every evidence of suffering from cold, I suggested that they were suffering from an excess of tropical heat. They mopped their foreheads and removed their coats. A respect for truth incites me to say here that in this experiment the subjects are not always really warm; however in all cases the phenomena are subjective and not objective. Boxing is an act of simple suggestion. The dentist scene is more complicated. A subject suffers with toothache (suggested sensation). He goes to the dentist, sits in the chair and opens his mouth (suggested action). A second subject believes to be a dentist himself (suggested idea) and goes through the motion of extracting the bad tooth. The other photographs represent different phases of suggested crime. It must be confessed it is only simulated, for the alleged dagger is a roll of newspaper. This gives rise to a formidable question. Would it be possible to bring about a veritable crime in real life, instead of an imaginary crime in a theatre or hospital? I do not hesitate to reply no, a thousand times no! Hypnotism, all powerful for good, is disarmed for evil.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while hypnotism may be a powerful tool for good, it cannot be used to carry out evil deeds as it requires voluntary participation and cannot be forced upon someone against their will. The experiments described in this text were solely for the purpose of demonstrating the power of suggestion and do not reflect reality. It is important to remember the influence of suggestion in our daily lives, and to always be aware of our own ability to choose what we believe and participate in."
