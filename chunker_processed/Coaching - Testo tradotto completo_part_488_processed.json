  "first_phrase": "In this insightful piece on the psychology of financial decision-making, the author addresses the difficulty of admitting error and shifting strategies.

In order to exit the illusion/hallucination and avoid all of this, it is necessary to expand one's own experience of the markets and hone those behavioural skills of ours which are suitably capable of leading us to the accomplishment of the intended objective. There is no single way of making gains in the market. A cornucopia of diverse methods exists to that effect. Accordingly, the wider the range of choices which are available to us, the greater will be the efficacy by which decisions might be taken. Begin to reason in terms of OPPORTUNITIES.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to improve as a trader, it is important to expand your vision and work on honing your behavioral skills.
