  "title": "What is the role of self-hypnosis in successful trading and how should traders define their objectives positively?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the importance of self-hypnosis in achieving a higher level of success in trading. However, this can only be achieved by making the right choices and having a balanced approach to the profession. The author notes that relying solely on intuition can be risky, and it is necessary to develop an intuitive business acumen through experience. Additionally, a trading system and underlying strategy can be useful in executing logical operations. In this concluding part, the author emphasizes the importance of defining positive objectives to achieve success, rather than simply avoiding hard work. The text explores why traders fail and provides corrective measures to improve one's chances of success.",
  "content": "In order to build a sixth sense, an intuitive business acumen, it is necessary to undergo a process of accumulating a type of experience pursuant to which our unconscious mind learns to have instinctive financial “insight”. Many operations, moreover, are sufficiently logical, which means that a trading system might prove to be of great benefit to us with regard to their execution. An underlying strategy has to be developed. Defining one's Objectives in a positive way Why have you decided to engage in trading? What has induced you to take that decision? Usually, the goal shared by all traders is the one of earning a lot, quickly and by avoiding the need to strive too hard. It is a normal occurrence for this class of persons, however, that they never achieve what they would like to see realized. Let us analyse those parts of such linguistic utterance which stand in need of correction. “Earning without making a hard effort” is a negative definition. We are essentially escaping from something (fatigue), rather than willing something positively. We have to define what we want in order for us to be successful, not what we do not want.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a successful trading strategy requires more than just a desire for fast and easy profits. It requires a positive, well-defined objective and a process of accumulating relevant experiences to build an intuitive business acumen. Coupled with logical trading systems, this can lead to an instinctive financial \"insight\" that can help traders achieve their desired goals more effectively."
