These techniques can help address problems related to health, family, relationship, and success by activating the inner mind and discovering areas of concern. The use of non-verbal communication, sounds, and metacommunicational codes can aid in creating a deep trance state, resulting in a fast and efficient therapy process. With proper practice and guidance, individuals can also learn to use self-hypnosis and magnetism to achieve their goals and overcome challenges."
