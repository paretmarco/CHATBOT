  "title": "What is Multi-Dimensional Awareness and How to Dismantle Rather Than Transcend Ego and Mind?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of dismantling versus transcendence in spiritual systems, and how Quantum Psychology offers a different approach. The author refers to Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ram Dass, discussing the importance of owning and experiencing one's psychology before attempting to let it go. The last 200 tokens delve into the idea of knowing and acknowledging one's concepts in order to move beyond them, and the limitations of solely pursuing transcendence. Overall, the text explores the different dimensions of human awareness and the importance of understanding and dismantling fixated awareness before attempting to achieve multi-dimensional awareness.",
  "content": "* Quantum Psychology knows that to go beyond your psychology and stabilize awareness in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., you might first have to own your psychology before you can un-own it. You first have .to be willing to BE it (\"your\" psychology) before \"you\" can UN-BE it. And you must be willing to have it (\"your\") psychology) before you can un-have it. Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, \"In order to let go of something you must first know what it is.\" Quantum Psychology says, \"In order to let go of something, you must first be willing to experience it.\" You also have to know and acknowledge \"your\" concepts so that you can then take them apart and go beyond them. Ram Dass used to say, \"In order to get out of a jail your must first know you are in one.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To experience ESSENCE, I AM, and other dimensions of awareness, you must first own and acknowledge your psychology and concepts. You cannot let go of what you do not acknowledge. Start by knowing and experiencing your current state before you can explore beyond it."
