  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the importance of having a vocation and the need for organization to achieve its ultimate goal were discussed. The author emphasized that organizing your activity is crucial to make profitable use of your energies. By coordinating and subordinating activities in an orderly arrangement, exhaustion, and illness can be prevented. In this last passage, the author underlines the significance of harmonious balance with the environment, taking into account individuality, social affiliation, and the transformative power of adaptation. Developing originality is the key to not being absorbed by the environment and being at the mercy of circumstances.",
  "content": "Subordinating: It is to give every activity a place which is suitably proportionate to the importance it possesses within the whole. If one, for instance, were to take a vow that he would work fifteen hours a day in the hope of attaining success earlier, he would be hastening to disaster. Exhaustion and illness would not be slow to seize his being. That is because he would have neglected the aspect of his wealth at the time of defining the coordinates of the various factors he has to pay attention to. Harmonious balance with the environment As we are all separate individuals and yet, at the same time social individuals affiliated to a group, we are duty-bound, at the stage of drawing up a life plan, to take into account the environment wherein we are destined to live. We will notice even in this context that by adapting to that environment we will transform it to one extent or another. We are all modifiers and creators of environments. It is important to develop originality, the ability, that is, not to be absorbed by the environment and be left at the mercy of circumstances.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, finding a harmonious balance with the environment and giving appropriate attention to all aspects of life is key to achieving success. Neglecting one's well-being or environment can lead to disaster, and developing originality and adaptability is crucial. Remember to exploit your environment for your purposes, and always strive to move towards a higher state. With these principles in mind, you can soar high and achieve your goals."
