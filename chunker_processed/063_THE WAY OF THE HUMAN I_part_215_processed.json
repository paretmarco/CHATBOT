  "title": "What is the Quantum Psychology Principle and how does the body's biology shape one's thinking and emotions?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text builds on the principles of Quantum psychology and the interconnectedness of various dimensions. The author speaks about their personal experience with body work and highlights the significance of the Biological dimension in linking all dimensions together. The mind is defined as a by-product of the nervous system and the fight/flight system, which govern a person's psychology. The text concludes with the concept that the body-soul are made of one substance and not just a vehicle for the soul.",
  "content": "131 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THE BIOPSYCHOLOGICAL: THE BIOLOGICAL-0THE PSYCHOLOGICAL For nearly 25 years, I have been a consistent receiver of body work. \"I\" have received Reichian therapy as well as hundreds of Rolfings and Feldenkrais sessions. \"I\" did Tai Chi for several years and have been doing Hatha Yoga everyday for almost 12 years. It has become apparent that it is the body which links together all of the dimensions, i.e., the External dimension, the Thinking dimension, the Feeling dimension, the Biological dimension, ESSENCE, the I AM, the COLLECTIVE and the \"Not-I-I.\" Quantum psychology defines the mind as consisting of a person's thoughts, memories, emotions, associations, perceptions and a scanning-searching device which scans the \"external\" and tends to create overgeneralizations, using past associations. It is important to know that the mind comes from the body. In other words, the nervous system and the biological fight/flight system, which are part of the physical body's nature, are also the governing and ruling principles behind a person's psychology (i.e., the thinking and emotional dimensions along with their memories and associations).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the connection between the biological and psychological dimensions is essential in achieving multi-dimensional awareness. The body plays a crucial role in linking all dimensions, and it is important to recognize that the mind is a byproduct of the nervous system and part of the fight/flight survival system. By prioritizing the body, we can better understand and improve our psychology."
