  "title": "\"What is the Sacred Meditation of the IAO and how does it relate to the symbolism in Perceval and the neurophysiology of the heart?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the Sacred Meditation of the I.A.O, which aims to activate the spine and open up our inner force. This force, which passes through the spine, is present in different ancient traditions such as the Kundalini, the central line of the Hebrew Kabbalah, or the central pillar of the Caduceus. This section also discusses the archetypal tendency towards verticality and the spiritual chivalry of the Graal Perceval, who must conquer his emotions. The fourth castle of Perceval provides a magical guided imagination where he defeats a lion, a symbol of our emotional self. Finally, this part focuses on the neurophysiology of the Heart, showing that the communication between the heart and the brain occurs in a dynamic and ongoing two-way dialogue.",
  "content": "Once born a child want to be vertical, to stay between sky and earth Spiritual Chivalry of the Graal Perceval - Celtic Mystery Initiation The episode of Perceval below means you must win your passions. Magical Guided Imagination You are Perceval And now, in the fourth castle a lion will be won. You enter. All the windows and doors of this castle are open. And you, Perceval now you meet a lion that want to attack you You kill it It arrives the owner of the lion that also want to fight with you You stay stable. He will be won also The lion are the emotions, that command us But the proprietary of the lion, won, will accept you, Perceval He will make friendship with him And you, Perceval you make friendship with the owner of the castle The lion is the symbol of our many emotions, and also the expression of our emotional I. We must win it Once our emotions will be won, we can make friendship with the proprietary of the lion, that is again our self Neurophysiology of the Heart This part of the Perceval is linked to the meaning of the heart Traditionally, the study of communication pathways between the head and heart has been approached from a rather one-sided perspective, with scientists focusing primarily on the heart’s responses to the brain’s commands. We have learned, however, that communication between the heart and brain actually is a dynamic, ongoing, two-way dialogue, with each organ continuously influencing the other’s function.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by winning over our emotions, symbolized by the lion, we can create a dynamic, ongoing two-way dialogue between the heart and the brain, leading to a balanced and fulfilling life. As Perceval demonstrated in the fourth castle, we must stay stable in the face of challenges and continue to practice Spiritual Chivalry to achieve inner peace. By understanding the neurophysiology of the heart, we can harness its power to positively impact our performance and well-being. Let us take inspiration from Perceval and embark on our own journey of self-discovery and growth."
