  "title": "\"How can identifying and naming our inner child's identity help us overcome anxiety and futurizing?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the focus was on identifying the two sides of the inner child's trance, which leads to self-awareness. Now, in the final 200 tokens, the author suggests giving a name to the inner-child identity, such as victim or manipulator, to help recognize it when it surfaces. By doing this, we can become observers of our thought patterns and behaviors, enabling us to disengage from automatic, unconscious states of being. The text concludes by exploring the concept of \"futurizing\" and how imagining a future scenario takes us out of present time reality, controlled by the inner child's dark side.",
  "content": "These exercises, when applied, give us the awareness that is needed to know the workings of this inner-child Identity so we can give it up and return to the present-time world. Futurizing Life is what happens to you, while you re busy making other plans. \"Beautiful Boy,\"John Lennon In John Lennon' s classic song \"Beautiful Boy,\" Lennon de- scribes a phenomenon that we all experience: our bodies being in present time, but our minds moving into the future. \"Futurizing\" describes this process, whether it be planning for the future, imag- ing a catastrophe in the future, imagining a pleasant outcome in the future, or just imagining talking with someone in the future. This trance comes from the dark side of the time-frozen inner child and it keeps us out of present-time reality. In the immortal classic by H.G. Wells, The Time Machine, a person is able to go forward or backward in time. The problem with futurizing is 1) travel is not in \"real time\" but in imagined time, and (2) in the time machine, a switch gives the operator choice, with automatic futurizing, there is no choice.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome the negative effects of futurizing, it is important to have awareness of our inner-child identity and stay present in reality. By recognizing and letting go of the dark aspects of our past, we can live a life focused on the present and avoid anxiety caused by imagined futures."
