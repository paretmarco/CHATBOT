  "title": "Can someone be hypnotized against their will and used as an instrument of crime?",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part of the text, the focus is on the possibility of hypnotism being used as an instrument of crime. The authors discussed in the previous text emphasize that no one can be hypnotized without their consent, and even if someone is hypnotized, they will not act against their personal affections and instincts. However, the fears that hypnotism can be used as a tool for criminal activities are unfounded, as criminals prefer to operate directly without intermediaries. The speech made in the Academy of Medicine further confirms that the dangers of hypnotism in society are more theoretical than real.",
  "content": "Supposing however that owing to circumstances impossible to foresee, a malefactor should win the confidence of a person whom he would use as the unconscious instrument of a crime; once fascinated, would that person obey the criminal suggestion? No, answers the illustrious Doctor Bruardel of Paris; if an individual pleasing to the somnambulist offers him agreeable or indifferent suggestions, he submits; but if the suggestion is revolting to his personal affections or his natural instincts, he opposes an invincible resistance. This is also the opinion of Doctor Charcot, who regrets that ignorant people should throw discredit on a science still in embryo and as innocent as youth itself. From a speech made in the Academy of Medicine on the 30th of December 1S8S, I take the following lines: \"The apprehensions in regard to the dangers of hypnotism carried out as an instrument of crime are much exaggerated. If we refer to the minute inquiries made on the question, the dangers which hypnotism brings to bear on society are more theoretical than real. Besides criminals have believed until now, and they are right, that it is more prudent for them to operate directly and without intermediaries.\" Space wants to multiply citations to the proof of my theory.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while there may be some concerns and fears surrounding the use of hypnotism as an instrument of crime, the evidence suggests that such dangers are largely exaggerated. It is important to remember that a hypnotized individual is still in possession of their own moral compass, and will resist any suggestion that violates their personal affections or natural instincts. As such, while hypnotism remains a fascinating and potentially powerful tool, it is unlikely to become a major weapon in the arsenal of criminals."
