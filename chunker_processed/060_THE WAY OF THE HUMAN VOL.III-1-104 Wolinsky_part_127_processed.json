  "title": "\"What is Dark Matter and its relation to human perception and spirituality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, we delve into the concept of Dark Matter and its implications beyond traditional physics. Before this, we see a conversation between Bob, Wolinsky, and Fred, exploring the concept of the 'Unknown' and how it relates to the human mind. Bob remains in silence throughout the conversation, while Wolinsky and Fred delve deeper into the nature of the 'Unknown.' In this section, Wolinsky poses questions about Dark Matter and whether it contains volition or free will. Fred states that the observer doesn't know and seeks to merge with it. Wolinsky and Fred also discuss the notion of the 'seeker after truth' as an archetype. Finally, Wolinsky raises a question about whether the external has become a reflection of this archetype.",
  "content": "(Absolute silence.) DEMONSTRATION #5 DARK MATTER: THE INVISIBLE WORLD Define Dark Matter. 125 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Fred:The Unknown, the back there . . . the unknown. Dark Matter is so much bigger than 'the known. The Unknown has unlimited potential. The mind is always trying to conceptualize and make sense of this unknown. Wolinsky:Does the Dark Matter contain volition, witness- ing, preferences and a free will? Fred:Whatever is trying to observe it does not know if it has volition, free will or preferences. The observer wants to merge. Therapeutic Note It is important to note whether the person is anthropomorphizing, i.e., projecting human qualities onto the unknown (Dark Matter). Secondly, this is like the Archetype of a wave in the ocean thinking it is separate from the ocean and trying to merge with the ocean, which it is already merged with. Wolinsky:What assumptions do you have about this dark matter, Unknown. Chapter ill Therapeutic Note The seeker after truth the unknown is an Archetype. Wolinsky:Has the external become a reflection and by-prod- uct of this seeker after truth Archetype?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Dark Matter is a vast unknown that holds unlimited potential, and our minds constantly try to conceptualize and make sense of it. It's important to note that we should not project human qualities onto the unknown, rather embrace the unknown as a part of ourselves. The seeker after truth is an Archetype and eventually, it will know and become itself."
