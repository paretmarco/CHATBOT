  "title": "\"What is the role of the VOID in perceiving personality and consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author encourages readers to notice the void or no state behind their senses, feelings, and desires. By being the pure awareness or the witness, the reader can experience the vastness of the void and understand what moves their body and senses. The author asks readers to allow the experience of the void to live through them, rather than living a personal life. Questions on the existence and nature of personality, thoughts, memory, emotions, associations, and perceptions are also explored earlier in the text.",
  "content": "Notice the VOID or the no state behind your eyes. Notice the VOID behind your sense of smell. Notice the VOID behind your feeling states. Notice the VOID behind your desire to learn. Notice the VOID behind your sense of taste. Notice the VOID behind your hunger. Notice the VOID behind your tiredness. Notice the VOID behind your sexuality. Notice the VOID behind your desire to merge. Notice the VOID behind your sense of differences. Notice the VOID behind your awareness. Be the VOID behind the noticer. Be the pure awareness (the WITNESS). Now, \"what is it that has a thousand eyes but cannot see, a thousand ears but cannot hear?\" Allow yourself to go further and further back into the vastness. Go further back into the vastness of the VOID. Notice the answer to the Zen Koan. Notice \"what it is that moves the arms, lifts the legs and hears.\" Experience that the VOID moves the arms and hears. Now, in a moment, I will ask you to open your eyes and come back to the room. Allow the experience of the VOID living through you rather than you living a personal life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing awareness of the VOID behind our senses and desires can allow us to cultivate a sense of pure awareness or \"the WITNESS.\" By experiencing the vastness of the VOID, we can allow it to move through us and live through us, rather than living a purely personal life. It all begins by noticing the VOID and the emptiness within our skin boundary, and allowing ourselves to go further back into the vastness."
