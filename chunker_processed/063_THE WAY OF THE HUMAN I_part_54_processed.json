  "title": "\"What is the False Core Driver in Quantum Psychology and how does it affect us?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of \"The False Core (Volume II)\", Quantum Psychology suggests a process to dismantle the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator for developing multi-dimensional awareness. The False Core Driver is a concept that organizes an individual's entire psychology, while the False Self Compensator is the way an individual tries to overcome it. The text further explains that these concepts not only act at the emotional and thinking dimensions but also have a biological component. The relevance of the Upanishads Chapter 11 is highlighted, which says that \"Whatever you do, you do for your own sake.\"",
  "content": "Furthermore, the mind (the nervous system) connects events and experiences, taking \"past\" experiences and placing them in present time contexts where they do not belong. Hence, the saying, \"You can never put your foot in the same river twice\" comes into play. Your False Core Driver organizes how associations organize and interpret all of these chains of associations. The False Core is that which pulls your chain. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The False Core Driver is the glue which holds together your entire psychology. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The False Self Compensator is how you attempt to compensate, heal, or solve the problem of the False Core Driver The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Quantum Psychology suggests a process whereby dismantling the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator is explored. Why? Because you are not your False Core Driver-False Self Compensator. You are even beyond the observer of the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator and all of its associations (uncooked seeds). However, it should be noted that not only does the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator act at the thinking and emotional dimensions, but there is a biological component to it as well.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to cultivate multi-dimensional awareness and truly understand the root of our psychological experiences, it is important to explore and dismantle the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator. This will require addressing the biological, energetic, and psychological components of these ingrained patterns. By doing so, we can begin to move beyond our past experiences and free ourselves from the chains of our False Core."
