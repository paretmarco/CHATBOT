  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, the focus is on the challenges of healing the False Core and False Self in Quantum Psychology. It delves into different ways False Cores manifest, such as feeling powerless and overcompensating for it. The text emphasizes the need to understand False Cores rather than their compensators and explores how some schools of thought view compensators as healthier than False Cores. Ultimately, the False Self must be deconstructed to reach a stable state of awareness beyond the False Core-False Self.",
  "content": "Why is the False Self unable to heal ________________ Chapter II or overcome the False Core and the Realization of Separation? Because they are one unit like inhaling and exhaling, that co-exist, you can't have one without the other. That's why I prefer the descriptions of each False Core-False Self to focus on the False Core driver rather than on the compensators. Somehow it feels more direct and honest. It should be noted that some psycho-spiritual schools believe that the False Self Compensator is healthier than the False Core. Quantum Psychology feels the opposite is true, that the compensation \"looks\" more healthy and socially acceptable. However, it is an integrated age-regression and is insidious using tricks by the False Self, as defense against the False Core and the Realization of Separation. For Quantum Psychology, the \"decompensation\" is more direct, honest, and certainly more uncomfortable. However, until the failure of the False Self is seen through along with its illusions, and the discomfort felt, it is impossible to go beyond the False Core-False Self and stabilize awareness. in ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the False Self and the False Core are two intertwined parts; one cannot heal without the other. It is essential to understand the False Core driver, rather than its compensators, to move beyond it. Quantum Psychology emphasizes the need for honesty and discomfort, rather than illusory compensations, to stabilize awareness and overcome the False Self-False Core dyad."
