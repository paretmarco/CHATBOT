SUSCEPTIBILITY TO EXTERNAL SUGGESTIONS: Institutions, other persons and a variety of additional factors might attempt to influence the trader, either intentionally or unintentionally. This phenomenon is termed social hypnosis, and it is particularly relevant to all the BUBBLES which might occur, and of which it represents the basic causative agent. Five Essential Qualities which a Trader should possess In order to counter “social hypnosis”, the trader will be obliged to develop some ESSENTIAL QUALITIES: 1. Presence, which coincides with Calm and Control over one's mental side: This is a state which is occasioned by \"being present to ourselves\". Though capable of making analyses about the future, a good trader must \"stay in the present\" and assess the situation clearly. 2. Freedom: Being free from emotional constrictions as well as from Rationality: It is a state which is linked to the trader's endeavour aimed at barring the invasive encroachment, by the reactions on the part of the brain's emotional side (limbic system), on his ability to make judgments.",
  "last_phrase": "To succeed as a trader in the face of social hypnosis and bubbles, one must possess essential qualities such as presence, freedom, and understanding of their objectives. Altering time frames or susceptibility to external suggestions could lead to losses, but with these qualities, a trader can ensure calm and control over their mental state, free themselves from emotional constrictions, and stay focused."
