  "title": "How does the belief that \"I have to give energy to receive energy\" affect the mother-child relationship and understanding of death?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, Wolinsky discusses the concept of identity and how it can create a structure of dependency, where energy needs to be constantly exchanged to maintain the feeling of existence. Now, he brings up the recent death of the client's mother and how her distorted concept of death is affecting her. He explains that from a quantum perspective, death is just a change in the state of consciousness, and there is neither birth nor death. He then shares a personal story of how he discovered his own programmed responses to a breakup. Finally, he asks the client to clarify whether she is in shock due to her mother's death or her separation.",
  "content": "But actually, there is neither. This is why Nisargadatta Maharaj said to me referring to -himself' \"I was never bornâ€”and I will never die.\" He was THAT VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and BEYOND. ________________ Therapeutic Note One thing came to my mind. Around ten years ago, I was in a relationship with a woman who lived in Maine. I was giving a workshop in Baltimore and she was supposed to visit me. Instead, she called and told me that not only was she not coming but she was breaking up with me. When this happened, I studied my inner process. It was like I had an internal book of rules. It was like I was looking into a book (my mind) which had been programmed to have an automatic response which I never questioned (it was in the software). It was like the rules were, break up, sudden break up, hurt, ah, yes, feel bad. And so I felt hurt and bad. I could see my unquestioned programming or my book of rules. Barbara:Then, there is just shock. Wolinsky:Shock at her death or shock that she's separate and gone now?",
  "last_phrase": "Remember, the mind is a software that can be programmed, but awareness liberates us from unconscious limitations. Letting go of our internal book of rules and becoming more conscious allows us to experience life beyond programmed responses and meet each moment with flexibility and openness."
