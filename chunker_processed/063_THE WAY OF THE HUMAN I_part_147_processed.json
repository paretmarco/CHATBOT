  "first_phrase": "This section discusses ways to develop awareness of the thinking dimension to deal with difficult experiences. The exercises help to identify and observe thoughts, acknowledging their impact on subjective experience, and letting them go. Using examples of waking up next to a loved one or feeling good in the morning, it describes how thoughts can arise and subside, and how we identify with them. The exercises are from Quantum Consciousness and Hearts of Fire, and aim to develop multi-dimensional awareness.",
  "content": "Then, all of sudden your mind thinks,\" I like the way they look,\" or \"I like how they are,\" or \"I like the way he/she sleeps next 'Many of these exercises are in Quantum Consciousness and Hearts of Fire. if you do not need a reviewâ€”skip them. The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness to me,\" etc. Two or three days later, you wake up and look at your lover and a thought goes by, \"Oh, no, what am I doing with her/ him?\" The next thing you find yourself thinking, \"I really would like to go out with somebody else,\" or \"Maybe I should get a divorce,\" or \"What a mistake, I am wasting my time.\" An even more common experience is to wake up in the morning feeling very good; a thought goes by your awareness called \"I feel good\" and you identify with that thought. Your mind will then start coming up with reasons why you feel good: \"I feel good because I got a lot of sleep.\" \"I feel good because I didn't sleep very much.\"",
  "last_phrase": "It's important to remember that thoughts and feelings come and go like passing clouds in the sky. Rather than identifying with them and reacting impulsively, we can observe them without judgment and choose a more intentional and practical response."
