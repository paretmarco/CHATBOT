  "content": "It is possible to create a type of engineering of emotional states in such a way that the best possible state can be used at any given moment. The aim of NLP and its associated methods is to provide you with the methodology, that puts into effect an astonishing process of growth of the possibilities within you. Thus, you will present yourself in a new, efficient way when faced with daily life situations. You already possess these things. You have to strengthen the courage and will to find trust in your feelings and internal being and learn how to follow them. In such a prospective, to “really” live can be a choice and not a chance. There are a large number of people that let there brain run at breakneck speed, wasting a lot of time experiencing things that they would prefer to avoid. It is important to realize that in this way the brain becomes a “room” so full of constant chattering that solutions have difficulty in entering due to lack of space. It is certainly useful to think about problems in order to solve them, but at the same time, it is also useful to start forming alternative strategies to be able to avoid them recurring. “Difficulties are the fire that shapes our character”. (Anthony Robbins) The above phrase might mean that every time we find ourselves faced with a problem, we can identify the most efficient strategy to confront the situation. What we called “difficulty” before becomes an opportunity to shape and improve ourselves, an invitation to act.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP and its associated methods provide a methodology for personal growth and development, enabling individuals to create an engineering of emotional states to enhance their daily life experiences. By understanding and modifying their unconscious reactions and plans, individuals can move towards a state of satisfaction and achieve their objectives with increased self-confidence. NLP is not just a group of techniques, but an attitude towards positive living and winning. Instant rapport, a new technology, is also introduced to help individuals construct and maintain good interpersonal relationships based on trust and agreement. With NLP and instant rapport, individuals can unlock their full potential and live their dreams."
