  "title": "How can we use hypnosis and the enneagram for communication and personal development?",
  "first_phrase": "This text provides insight into the world of hypnosis and the power of efficient communication, which can impact our lives both personally and professionally. It discusses the role of a hypnotist as a pilot who steers their passengers towards their desired destination and highlights the importance of consent in hypnosis. The text then delves into the Enneagram personality system, which can be used as a tool for understanding and communicating with others. It explains each of the nine personality types and how they can be identified in interpersonal interactions. The text concludes with a message of personal empowerment and the idea that life changes when we change.",
  "content": "It is in fact false, as well as never being scientifically proven, that through hypnosis you can make someone commit acts against their will. Even if the hypnotist tries, the subject will not carry out the order given or might even decide to come out of the hypnotic trance, refusing to continue. Hypnotism, even if triggered by another person, is essentially “autogenous” in the sense that it uses an absolutely natural functioning process of our psyche. It may seem ridiculous to think that- if up until now we were convinced that life was a succession of happenings- that we need to prepare ourselves to live. Now we can see things from another prospective and say that: Life changes at the moment in which we change and we can consider ourselves as protagonists of our life without having to content ourselves with the walk-on parts or be forced to live by life. Perhaps arriving at the foot of the page and writing the words “The End” makes us realize that what we see behind us is not our story, what we would have wanted, and regret not having obtained what it was that we wanted because we have been the obstacle. “Life is something that happens to us while we are busy doing other things”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnosis is not a tool to make someone do something against their will, but rather a powerful technique for self-improvement and achieving personal objectives. It can be used with various hypnotic communication models, including the negative order model, to achieve a trance-like state and create a state of relaxation. Self-hypnosis is an efficient technique for resolving everyday problems and achieving personal goals. With practice, you can learn how to relax and concentrate, communicate with your unconscious mind, and achieve the desired results. By using the present tense and respecting certain rules, you can harness the power of your mind and become the protagonist of your life."
