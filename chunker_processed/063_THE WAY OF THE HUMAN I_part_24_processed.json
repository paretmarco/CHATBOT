  "title": "How can we achieve Multi-Dimensional Awareness and be fully human?",
  "first_phrase": "This text reflects on the author's journey to seek self-realization and human potential, discussing the limitations of the human potential movement and the desire to go beyond self-actualization. The author went to India to seek self-realization through yoga and Buddhist practices, but found that the requirement of giving up the world was unrealistic. The author now seeks to answer the question of how to stabilize the awareness of underlying unity while being fully human. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the split felt between the desire for spiritual growth and the need to live and interact with the world, completing the human potential movement.",
  "content": "my life had changed through psychology and certainly' I no longer felt self-defeating but much more powerful and in touch with my body and feelingsâ€”but still I felt unfinished. I had not found out WHO I WAS. For years I put aside psychology since I saw that SELF-ACTUALIZATION was the end point of psychology and was not all that I had hoped it would be. I decided to go to India to seek SELF-REALIZATION. By 1976 I was headed for India and SELF-REALIZATION (\"NOT-I-I\") and WHO I WAS. In India, and later on in the United States, through yoga and Buddhist practices, many of us were able to experience quite readily the empty-mind (no-mind), pure WITNESSING, and the underlying unity I now call Quantum Consciousness. Unfortunately, in India it was stated both overtly and covertly that to attain and live in THAT VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS required a giving-up of the world. At first, this seemed romantic, noble, and super-spiritual; but in the end I saw that this was both impractical and unrealistic. After all, most of us live, work, have relationships, and interact with the world. In the late-1970s, I felt split.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, multi-dimensional awareness is the integration of our spiritual and material selves, where self-actualization meets self-realization. It allows us to experience the underlying unity and interconnected fullness of life while still living, working, and interacting in the world. With this understanding, we can cultivate a sense of wholeness and personal power, truly discovering who we are and living a fulfilled life."
