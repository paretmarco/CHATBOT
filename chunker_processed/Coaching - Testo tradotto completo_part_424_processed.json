  "title": "What are Coherence Fields and How Can They Affect Human Interaction?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of coherence fields and how it relates to our presence and energy. They explain that through consciousness and being present, our coherence field can become denser, which can lead to powerful things materializing. However, the author cautions that we need to differentiate between coherence field and coherence as such, and that being coherent in error can be problematic. In the last 200 tokens, the text focuses on the varieties of coherence fields, including superficial and deeper levels. It also touches on the importance of \"thickening\" one's presence in order to prevent getting lost in someone else's game.",
  "content": "At that stage, in fact, our interlocutor will end up losing any point of reference. He might even start sensing some changes in his way of perceiving reality 110. The human being is in actual fact very subtle. It is extremely easy to go past the immediate surface of his being. If we are very present, we might actually get to the source. The coherence field The concept that, through consciousness, presence is thickened, leads one to the thought that we might perhaps be made of energy. The more present we are, the denser we become. Powerful things might then materialize, since we would be creating what is capable of being defined as a “coherence field”. In this discipline, an important factor consists in differentiating between coherence field and coherence as such. The majority of human beings are sufficiently coherent in what they do. The problem is that one might be coherent in error as well. By contrast, the coherence field is a field of attraction. It is like a validation of the reality which our interlocutor steps into. Varieties of Coherence Field There are two coherence fields: 1. Superficial 2.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, understanding the concept of coherence field and differentiating between superficial and deep fields can help us in creating a reality that is more aligned with our true selves. By being present and becoming denser in energy, we can attract powerful things into our life. Demystifying our ideas and coming down to the foundational level can help us achieve this state, where emotions are no longer a hindrance to our coherence."
