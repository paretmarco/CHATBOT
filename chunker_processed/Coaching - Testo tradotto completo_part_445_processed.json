  "title": "How Do Financial Markets Operate Under Hypnosis and Why Do Traders Repeat Same Mistakes?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned that repeating negative habits cannot be excused by the foolishness of human nature. Instead, it can be attributed to a state of \"hypnosis,\" where our egotistic self dominates, leading to a lack of presence, sensory attention, and fear. This \"social hypnosis\" is responsible for the mass behavior observed in financial markets, resulting in bubbles and market movements driven by emotional reactions. In this last part, the author highlights the importance for traders to understand and free themselves from these mechanisms to be successful. The text also discusses how even respectable institutions can engage in risky actions, which may not be apparent to less experienced observers.",
  "content": "By virtue of the impact of media, a large number of people decide to buy or to sell at the same time, all together. The economic theory of a rational market is daily refuted by facts, since market movements are occasioned by the sum-total of emotional reactions coming from a multitude of different persons. An effective trader who earns well must necessarily know and understand these mechanisms, both in so far as they manifest in other people and in terms of how they manifest in his own self. He must have such knowledgeable comprehension of them as to free himself thereof and be accordingly able to function. The effective trader knows how to be present, and does not lower his attention because of emotion. The financial markets are ruled by hypnosis. What else, in fact, might be able to explain the phenomenon by virtue of which some traders incessantly repeat the same mistake, unless we refer to a narrowing of their attention field? In an identical fashion, how else, we may ask, can we explain the fact that even respectable institutions carry out actions which in the view of a less experienced observer as well might be judged to be more than merely audacious and risky?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to be a successful trader, one must not only understand the mechanisms that drive the financial markets but also be able to free themselves from the emotions that may hinder their decision-making process. By recognizing the power of suggestion and the potential for hypnosis in market movements, one can learn to be present and aware, making informed decisions that lead to financial success."
