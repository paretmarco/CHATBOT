  "first_phrase": "In this conversation between Wolinsky and Barbara, the idea of creating one's existence through others is explored. Prior to this, Barbara discusses her grief, which she realizes is rooted in her judgment of her father. Wolinsky suggests that she remove the label and allow the judging energy to return to its source, her father. Barbara acknowledges that she can do this and notes that she had to give energy to her mother to receive energy back, which allowed her to feel like she existed. Wolinsky then asks Barbara how she deceived herself and points out the deception that she doesn't exist. As she realizes this, her body calms down.",
