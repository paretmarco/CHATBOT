  "title": "How to Develop a Life Plan and Ideal with Alternative Imaginations and Unexpected Situations?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discusses how making a small effort to meet someone can lead to a valuable conversation and help avoid an undiluted loss. The author suggests planning for unexpected situations by developing alternative means and two different scenarios: one if things don't go as planned, and another if things go better than expected. In this concluding section, the author focuses on the importance of having a logical life plan and different ideals for each person. Not everyone can clearly perceive their life purpose, particularly those in their youth. As such, it's essential to have programs and ideals that are connected to oneself. Finally, the author adds that having an excellent friend can be an excellent ideal at any stage in one's life.",
  "content": "It must in fact solve the following problem: Arranging oneâ€™s life in such a way that, even if death were to truncate it at the start or in the middle of that day, life would in any event have already received a prize for its efforts. As we have stated in the introduction to this book, not every person is the beneficiary of the gift of clearly perceiving the purpose of his existence. It is due to the aforesaid that the youth who are still going through the stage of being initiated into life, are hardly likely to talk of an ideal with the conviction that it is not going to change in the years to come. It is therefore possible to also formulate programs with a narrower range, always taking care to be connected to one's own self. Be it as it may, having an excellent friend can be a great ideal at any stage of one's life.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the key to arranging one's life is to have a clear understanding of one's individuality and potentialities, and to formulate an ideal or life plan accordingly. While not everyone may have a clear perception of their life's purpose, it is still possible to develop a narrower program that is connected to oneself. As the Eastern poet suggests, aim further than what you know you can reach, and let your desire push you as far as you can go. And remember, an excellent friend can be a great ideal at any stage of life."
