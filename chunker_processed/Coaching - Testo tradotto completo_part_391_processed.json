  "title": "\"How can using the ocular greeting and projection techniques enhance your communication skills?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we discussed the importance of the \"ocular greeting\" to make a powerful first impression during business interactions. Now, we turn our focus to the defining moment, when presenting a business proposal. It is crucial to maintain direct eye contact and confidently articulate your deal. Put yourself in a state of mind where you desire the outcome intensely, and ensure the person you are addressing does not look away from your face. By doing so, you will have a stronger influence on them.",
  "content": "If you, however, put yourselves in the state of mind, or we could say in the existential mood we have described a short while ago, you will carry out that motion spontaneously. Your interlocutor will start asking himself whether the two of you had not already met before somewhere, and at the very least, he will deal with you in a more intimate manner. At the time when you are about to formulate a business proposal: Do not direct your look elsewhere, and do not lower your eyes when you are about to articulate a business proposal. You should rather inquire about the object of your desire, and explain your deal in a few words, clearly and persuasively, by looking straight at the person you are busy addressing. Have a firm resolution to influence him, and keep in mind that you will have to do exactly what you would like him to do. Think of what you desire intensely. If you wish to influence a man, you should take care, once you have reached the kernel of the entire issue, the defining moment, not to allow him, if at all possible, to look at any thing other than your face.",
  "last_phrase": "When articulating a business proposal, maintain a strong demeanor by looking directly at the person you're addressing. Project confidence, convey your message clearly, and inspire the other person to take the desired action. Use techniques like subtext and intended projection to influence their response positively. With practice, you'll be able to close deals with ease."
