  "title": "What are the Oedipal Archetypes? Understanding Resentment and False Self in Therapy.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, Wolinsky explores the emergence of \"Oedipal Archetypes\" as Debra discusses her relationship with her mother. The conversation revolves around Debra stating that since she couldn't merge with her mother, she merged with her dad instead, which felt more empowering. Wolinsky suggests that Debra express resentment towards her mother's image and she uses stealing her mother's husband as a false self-distractor to prove her worth. The conversation ends with Debra repeating that she will steal her mother's husband to get even with her.",
  "content": "I'll get even with you morn, I'll steal your husband. Wow. She knew that too. Absolutely. Wolinsky:Say that again. To get even with you, morn, I'm going to steal your husband. He is going to like me better. That's what I did. ________________ Chapter 1 Wolinsky:Look at the image of your mother over there and say \"I resent\" and (fill in the blanks). Therapeutic Note In Gestalt therapy, guilt is retroflected resentment, i.e., unexpressed resentment which is put back on yourself. Notice how she uses another False Core distractor of Resentment to avoid her False Core and how she uses the False Self of stealing her, (morn's) husband to prove worth and not feel unworthy. Therapeutic Note In this session, we could have her look at her mother's age-regression and re-enactment of her (her mother's) situations. However, this does not seem important right now. There is more than enough going on. Wolinsky:Say that again. To get even with you, I'm going to steal your husband.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to recognize and express our true feelings to avoid unexpressed resentment and guilt. We should never use false cores or self to prove our worth, but instead work on our issues to develop a sense of self-worth. Let's focus on communicating our needs effectively and working towards building healthy relationships."
