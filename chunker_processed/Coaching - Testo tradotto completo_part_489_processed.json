  "title": "\"How Can Traders Expand Their Trading Vision and Overcome Post-Hypnotic Suggestions?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text elaborates on how traders can avoid being trapped in their own personal realities and expand their experiences of the market in order to be successful. It emphasizes the importance of being rational and looking at trading through the lens of opportunities, rather than sticking to limited beliefs. The author also discusses the effects of post-hypnotic suggestions on traders and how conditioning from childhood can impact trading decisions. The main takeaway is that flexibility and adaptation are necessary for success in trading.",
  "content": "The real trader is the one who inquires about things, gathers information, grabs opportunities and scores a gain, not the one who obdurately sticks to one line only and lies even to his own self, because he desires things to unfold themselves in accordance with his subjective wishes. Traders’ Post-Hypnotic Suggestions Another context in which hypnotic forms of conditioning are important is the field of commands which have been received during one's childhood. For example, many people, when they were children, have assimilated the following suggestion: \"The more you do, the more you are going to have\". In trading, however, matters do not work that way. It happens at times that when one does too much, he fails to score gains, or, as one Italian proverb puts it, “too much is crippling”. In the field of hypnosis, “post-hypnotic suggestion” is the term used to define the state where a person keeps on obeying a particular injunction even when the stimulus is no longer present.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, trading is not about blindly following childhood conditioning or post-hypnotic suggestions. The real traders are those who gather information, analyze opportunities, and make calculated decisions to score gains. It is crucial to recognize and overcome any self-hypnosis or overtrading tendencies by being true to yourself and using methods like self-hypnosis to break free from detrimental patterns of behavior."
