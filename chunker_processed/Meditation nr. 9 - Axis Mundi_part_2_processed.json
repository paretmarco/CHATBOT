  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the significance of a column that represents the center of the world surrounded by three sets of five crosses each. The color of each cross represents our relationship with the spiritual dimension, our power over action, and our dominance over reality. Perceval, the main protagonist, meets a Fylgja, a woman who takes him to a magical pavilion where he receives a magic mantle. Later, he frees himself from the mount of pain and heads back to the castle of Roy Pecheur. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of wanting to be free, awakening oneself, and finding the real path of chivalric initiation.
