  "title": "What is the Law of Paradoxical Change and how does it relate to Eastern wisdom and the experience of trance?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the paradoxical change principle, which states that to change something, it is necessary to intensify it first. This principle is reflected in Eastern wisdom and contemporary clinical practices. The text cites Lao-tzu, Tao-te Ching, and Zen Rossi and fichaku to explain the paradox of \"symptom as cure.\" It also mentions the state of therapeutic trance and the no-trance state. The last 200 tokens recount the personal experience of a Zen student who entered an expanded state through intense focus on a koan.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this experience of absorption and doubt led to a realization that enlightenment cannot be sought and that the many koans handed down from the past have no value. This understanding can help us focus on the present moment and let go of the cycle of birth and death, ultimately leading to a sense of inner peace."
