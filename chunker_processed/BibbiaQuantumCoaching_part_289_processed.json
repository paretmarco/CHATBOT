  "title": "What is the link between quantum theory and consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the connection between quantum physics and consciousness, looking at theories that suggest that the brain processes information in a holographic and quantum way. It references Karl Pribram's “Holographic Brain Theory” and the holographic universe theory. The last 200 tokens feature a variety of specialists discussing the relationship between consciousness and quantum phenomena, including Brian Flanagan, Henry Stapp and Rakovic, Dugic. They cover topics such as attention and intention, the quantum Zeno effect, and the role of mental effort in decoherence. The text concludes with a discussion of a brain-based approach to coaching from authors Rock and Schwartz.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the relationship between quantum theory and consciousness is a fascinating and ongoing area of research, with studies such as those discussed in the Journal of Creative Behavior and Anesthesia shedding light on the connections between mind and matter. It is clear that understanding this intersection is crucial for developing greater insights into our own thought processes and the nature of reality itself. As we continue to explore these ideas, we may come closer to answering one of the most fundamental questions in philosophy: how can we think the complex?"
