  "title": "How does self-talk affect our beliefs and behaviors?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of self-talk was discussed, highlighting how inner voices can affect the beliefs and actions of individuals. The text also touched on how these voices are created through suggestions made by parents or others. In the last 200 tokens, the text delves deeper into how experiences shape an individual's belief system and how they become frozen in the mind as a result. Principle I is introduced, which posits that once an experience leads to a positive outcome, it becomes an ingrained part of a person's belief system. The text also mentions \"fusion,\" a style of self-talk that will be briefly explored.",
  "content": "The child within, when involved with mechanics, plays the taped message. The child within experiences the \"I don't under- stand\" associated with machines, along with frustration as its outcome or the altered state it produces. Machines trigger the experience, and the child as an adult goes into the \"I don't under- stand\" trance. Principle I: An experience, once occurring following a pleasant outcome, will become part of the person's belief system exactly as it is. Inner Dialogue 4) 69 child struggles through it and succeeds, \"See, if you work hard, you can do anything.\" The child has received his reward and approval and begins to \"work hard\" obsessively to do everything to get approval. Here, the hypnotic suggestion \"work hard\" can become frozen, an external trigger like money or approval, which then triggers \"work hard and receive approval.\" This is placed on automatic. The resulting experience is one of feeling driven and yet experiencing it is never quite enough. Another style of self-talk which overlaps is \"fusion\" and will only be discussed in brief.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the role of the child within in our experiences with machines and the resulting beliefs and self-talk that emerge. By understanding the principles of how experiences shape our belief systems and the potential for fusion with external identities, we can better navigate the automatic triggers that drive our behavior and work towards a more conscious and empowered sense of self."
