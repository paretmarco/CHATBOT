  "first_phrase": "This text titled \"Going into the fluid state\" delves into the various techniques and exercises used to induce a state of ecstasy in therapy. Before the last 200 tokens, the text discusses exercises to activate the spine and an exercise to work on pain in the spine, specifically using magnetic ecstasy. The last 200 tokens cover additional exercises, including using a mirror. These exercises aim to activate ecstasy and reinforce magnetism, leading to a deeper transformation of the individual. The text also explores the physiological and hermetic interpretations of working on the spine and inducing ecstasy. Finally, the text explains the techniques of the closure of the senses and the ten plexuses technique.",
  "content": "Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call \"butterfly movements\" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up. ============================================= Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on \"warming the mercury\" It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system - NORMAL - excitated this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown ============================================= For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes. We call this technique \"closure of the senses\" The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques: Closure of the senses Technique of the 10 plexuses CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION -. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these three days of therapy have explored various techniques for non-verbal communication and hypnosis, including exercises for equalizing magnetic force, inducing ecstasy, non-verbal hypnotism, and somnambulism. Additionally, the use of sounds and metacommunicational codes to induce a hypnotic state have been explored, as well as the use of the human pendulum test to stimulate unconscious responses. Through these exercises, participants can learn how to manifest presence, project magnetic voice, and use suggestive phrases to achieve a hypnotic state. Overall, these techniques can prove useful for those seeking to better understand and communicate with others, as well as those seeking to improve their own mental health and well-being."
