  "first_phrase": "This text is a continuation of the previous text discussing the techniques used to induce ecstasy in clients during hypnotherapy sessions. The text mentions different exercises using music, mirrors, and magnetism to induce a state of deep trance. The goal is to create a physiological and hermetic state that will help in healing especially back pain and sciatica. The text emphasizes the importance of the spine and how it works as the basic pillar of the human organism. The text also discusses how to induce magnetic states without physical passes, instead using a technique called \"closure of senses\" and the \"Ten plexuses technique.\" The main goal of these techniques is to learn different methods of inducing crises and equalizing the magnetic forces in a patient.",
  "content": "Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call \"butterfly movements\" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up. ============================================= Hermetic view: we could say that worked on the spine we worked on \"warming the mercury\" It is very interesting to analyse what happens when we do ecstasy For the ancient mercury was identified with the nervous system . We have two positions for our nervous system - NORMAL - excitated this excitation is an excitation of our nervous system Exitation can happen also in front of the unknown ============================================= For doing the preceding exercise to do magnetism we had to induce our partner There is a faster way of doing it than with magnetic passes. We call this technique \"closure of the senses\" The closure of the senses is the companion of another technique called of the 10 plexuses BENEFITS of the closure of the senses: realizing a magnetic state in a faster way BENEFITS of the 10 plexuses technique: it can be good for anxiety, it can also be done after a crisis LEARNING THE TWO TECHNIQUES We proceed now with to learn two further important techniques: Closure of the senses Technique of the 10 plexuses CLOSING THE SENSES AND INITIAL EQUALIZATION -. What are the twelve main passes to equalize the magnetic force in the patient?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises and techniques can be highly effective for inducing a magnetic state in individuals and helping them overcome various issues, including anxiety, relationship problems, and physical pain. From butterfly movements to magnetic passes and the test, each technique offers unique benefits for improving psychological and physical health. With ongoing practice and refinement, individuals can achieve a magnetic voice, greater presence, and more profound hypnotherapy results. Summarily, these training exercises provide practical tools that people can apply in their daily lives to experience greater well-being and overcome a range of critical issues."
