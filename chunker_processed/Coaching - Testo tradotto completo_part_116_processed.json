  "title": "What is the procedure for achieving zero-ideation and how can it be achieved through mental effort and relaxation?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, the procedure for achieving \"zero-ideation\" is discussed. The author explains that it is important to break up every conscious cerebral undertaking and shatter logical thought. To achieve this, one should seclude themselves, relax and halt the emission of thoughts. The key is to fixate on a single idea, such as \"something black\" and chase away any intruding thoughts. The author notes that achieving total zero-ideation is rare because the mind is usually either fixed on one idea or jumping from thought to thought. However, this technique can be adapted to other mono-ideation, such as the idea of a flowing river or an unrolling rope.",
  "content": "In case some extraneous thought interposes itself, chase it away through a brief deliberate effort, and then go back to perceiving the black ... something black ... think of nothing other than the black. To recapitulate, the procedure unfolds itself through three different stages: 1. Secluding oneself 2. Relaxing 3. Halting one’s cerebral work or, to put it better, breaking up every conscious cerebral undertaking. Total zero-ideation is something rare. So long as the mind is awake, its mechanism is in fact usually orientated in one or two ways: It is either directed at a fixed idea, or else it jumps from one idea to another in accordance with laws of association. What is important to do is to shatter logical thought, that is, the representation which images arouse in us. To take an example, “seeing something black” and nothing other than the black is not an easy task, and it is not necessary after all. One person might find it easier to actualize a different mono-ideation, e.g. the idea of a flowing river, of a rope which goes on ad infinitum and which our thought ensures it will unceasingly roll out, and so on.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving a state of zero-ideation is a challenging yet highly beneficial practice that requires seclusion, relaxation, and the breaking up of conscious cerebral activity. While the task of perceiving nothing but darkness may not be easy for everyone, individualizing your mono-ideation or denying attention to conscious thoughts can be just as effective. By reaching the absolute zero, we can tap into the underlying wisdom that is often obscured by our constant stream of thoughts and perception of reality."
