  "title": "How Can Understanding the Brain and Physiology Help Us Connect with Our Essential Being?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we explored how the different areas of the brain correspond to physical, emotional, and mental levels. Now, in the remaining 200 tokens, we delve into the concept of our essential being and its connection to the direction of the universe. Through specific exercises, we can access our inward essence, which holds our potentialities and reveals itself with greater clarity in dreams. It is within this essential being that we find our particular ideal and the energies required to achieve it. The contact with our essential being is established by actualizing a state of harmony and utilizing intuition. The words of De Musset and Lamartine perfectly illustrate this concept.",
  "content": "Which is the person who – during a dream – has not authored verses or composed music, delivered lectures or solved problems, or formulated plans endowed with a power which far exceeded our capacities in the state of wakefulness? Yet all of that emanated from you, it was ensconced in you, implanted in your senses and in your brain. It means, therefore, that you are potentially far more than what you might presume to be. « I do not work; I listen», were the words De Musset used to address to whoever asked him about the modus operandi he utilized for his poems. As for Lamartine, he was accustomed to mention what follows: «I am not the one who is thinking. My ideas, rather, are the ones that think on my behalf». It is only within our essential being that we might detect the particular ideal we need to aspire to. It is from the viewpoint of such essential inward identity that the energies we require to achieve whatever we wish might arise. The contact that is established with one’s essential being is the result of actualizing a state of general “harmony”, and knowing how to utilize intuition.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we are all capable of great things beyond our imagination. Our essential being, located beyond the brain and throughout the entire body, holds the key to unlocking our true potential. By utilizing relaxation techniques and centralizing ourselves, we can establish contact with this hidden potential and tap into the energies necessary to achieve our goals. As De Musset and Lamartine have shown us, the creative genius within us is waiting to be discovered."
