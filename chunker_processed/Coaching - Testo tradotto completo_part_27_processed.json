  "title": "\"What is True Vitality and How Can We Attain It?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned that true vitality is not about physical strength, but rather a surplus of nervous tension rooted in mental aspects. Now we will dive deeper into this concept, exploring the state of \"vital erethism\". This surplus of energy demands to be released, whether it's through physical exercise or mental activity. The idea is to learn how to accumulate tension within a balanced organism and thus have available energy to spend, just like having cash in a bank account. We will explore different types of erethism, including gastric and muscular, and how they relate to this concept.",
  "content": "For example, we have gastric erethism when the papillae of the stomach are stimulated by the juices which require food to be elaborated, when, to put it simply, we feel appetite. At that point we are more alert, more active. We feel well when we realize that our balance sheet contains some spare energy, in precisely the same way as a commercial sheet is deemed good when it shows a net positive amount. We have a muscular erethism when our muscular fibre, well nourished and rested, asks to engage in some physical exercise; in other words, when, to give an illustration, the legs naturally set themselves in motion, so to speak, when we would gladly jump around a bit, race for a while or relish a somersault. Erethism, therefore, always derives from a surplus of available strength.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to fully enjoy life and avoid chronic illness and nervous senility, it is essential to acknowledge that the true source of pleasure is within ourselves. By fulfilling our physiological needs and regulating our knowledge of enjoyment, we can pave the way for a more joyful existence. Remember to take care of your body and prioritize your well-being."
