  "title": "What is Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and how does it differ from traditional therapies?",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on the different therapeutic techniques that use NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) and other psychotherapeutic approaches to help clients change self-defeating behaviors. It discusses techniques such as compromise analysis, psycho-synthesis and Ericksonian hypnotherapy. The author emphasizes that these techniques are beneficial because they focus on revealed behavior and the ability to make choices, rather than on the causes of the behavior. The author suggests that using these tools allows for personal growth, the development of self-control, and the attainment of mental health. NLP is an approach that emphasizes freedom, choice, self-control, and autonomy, and can be used by anyone who wants to take control of their life.",
  "content": "However, what differentiates NLP is that it does not have any kind of subdivision and considers the individual in his/ her peculiar individuality, singleness and unity, having the ability to steer himself/ herself once s/he has learnt the relevant knowledge. Man is gifted with a mind that is able to invent the existence of time, space and conscience. S/he is an actor on a stage that s/he has constructed, complete with all the necessary accessories and scenes. Unfortunately, s/he does not realize the powerful instrument s/he has in his possession, in other words, the possibility to put “free will” into action or to be able to decide on what part he has on his own life stage. We live in a culture where other people program our brains or better still, where we in turn unconsciously program ourselves. So why do not we use this ability on ourselves when we are the first people in the world that we have to respect and understand? NLP’s key words are freedom, choice, self-control, autonomy, mental health and the power of communication based on feedback, in the sense that at the moment in which we communicate the other person has to interact with us. One of the corner stones of NLP is: “The significance of a communicative message is in the reaction that determines it”. I would like to highlight one more thing, which is that the instruments and techniques presented here all point to the “how” and “what” of the subjective experience.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP offers individuals the tools to take control of their own lives and make the necessary changes to reach their full potential. Its emphasis on freedom, choice, self-control, and communication based on feedback can lead to improved mental health and autonomy. By analyzing reality at different levels and generating rapport with others, NLP can provide a holistic approach to personal development. With NLP, individuals have the power to change and improve themselves by choosing the way that is most agreeable to them. The possibilities are endless once we tap into the powerful instrument of our minds."
