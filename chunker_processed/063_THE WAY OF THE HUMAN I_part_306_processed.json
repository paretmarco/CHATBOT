  "title": "\"What is the Relationship Between Desire and Resistance? Understanding Desires as Energy.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, it has been discussed how desire can manifest in different forms during a child's growth. It could start as a requirement to fulfill biological needs and then shift towards filling psychological gaps. However, in adulthood, our desires become more complicated and are often a reflection of resistance towards unfelt experiences. This section stresses the importance of understanding the source of our wants and allowing ourselves to explore them non-judgmentally. The author suggests that instead of focusing on the object of desire, we should pay attention to the energy of desire. The section ends with a practical suggestion to practice focusing on the energy of desire, rather than the object of desire itself.",
  "content": "For example, when we feel a lack of love (merger), rather than experiencing that, we eat or have sex. Often, status symbols like big houses or cars are attempts to relieve pain for feeling a lack of self-worth. This is how desires escalate and get distorted Understanding that desires are often a way to resist unfelt experiences gives Buddha's Noble Truth, \"Be desireless,\" a new meaning: Instead of trying to be desireless, don't resist, allow yourself to experience what is driving the desire rather than the substituted idea or image of what will satisfy the desire. As the practice begins to deepen, people often develop a nonjudgmental approach toward exploring their desires as opposed to trying to get rid of them, overcome them, deny them, or transform them. Instead, they see them as made of energy. 194 Focus: Focus your attention on the energy of desire rather than on the object being desired. (Singh) Practice: Let your eyes close. Allow an object of extreme desire to come into your mind. Imagine it is out in front of you. It could be a person, a situation, or anything- that you want.",
  "last_phrase": "Embrace your desires instead of fighting them. Recognize that they are made of energy and allow yourself to experience what is driving them, rather than focusing solely on the object of your desire. Shift your attention to the energy of the desire itself and become non-judgmental in exploring it. This approach can lead to a deepening of your practice and a greater understanding of yourself."
