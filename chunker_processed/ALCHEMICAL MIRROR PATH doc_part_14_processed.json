  "title": "\"What are the stages and exercises to achieve cosmic consciousness through the use of mirrors?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a guide to a series of exercises designed to help individuals achieve a higher state of consciousness and better understand their true nature. The last part of the text focuses on the fourth stage, which involves lucid dreaming in a waking state. Through various exercises, individuals are taught to overcome their ordinary sense of self and access their deeper, inner selves. This is achieved by focusing on the elements (air, water, earth, and fire) and using mirrors to induce altered states of perception. The text also discusses various traditions that have used mirrors or other containers to develop this ability, including an Egyptian tradition practiced by Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli and the famous Cagliostro.",
