  "title": "\"What is the experience when separating emptiness and loneliness in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of emptiness and being alone, and how they relate to resistance and creation. In the previous part, Wolinsky and Claudia separated the conclusion and energy of their experience from the emptiness and found peace and expansion. In the last part, they dive deeper into the idea of the not-I and the I, and how the lack of definition can lead to feelings of isolation. The exercise uncovers how Claudia decided that in order to have an \"I,\" she must be alone.",
  "content": "Claudia:All that tension, anguish, prison, confinement, iso- lation. Wolinsky:Okay, and if you separate it, what if anything gets resisted? Claudia:The lack of boundaries gets resisted. ________________ Chapter Ri Wolinsky:But deep down knowing that you couldn't? Claudia:Yeah. Wolinsky:Now, notice the not I and the I. Move your aware- ness outside of the I and the not I and see the I and the not I as the same substance. How are you doing? Claudia:Good. Really expanded and spacious. EXERCISE: THE NOT I-I What did you assume, decide or believe that got a lack of definition to be resisted? There's no I. Now, did you decide that one of the reasons that you are no longer one with your mother was be- cause you had no definitions and there was no I? Precisely. And since you decided this was true, I have no definitions and no I, therefore, that is the reason I am separate and alone, what then did you decide to do since you decided that? I decided that in order to have an \"I\" I have to be alone.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the \"not I-I\" exercise, you can become more aware of your identity and the lack of boundaries that may be holding you back. By witnessing and labeling the \"not I\" and the \"witness,\" you can expand your consciousness and create more spaciousness within yourself, allowing you to break free from tension, anguish, prison, confinement, and isolation. Use the steps outlined in this exercise to achieve a greater sense of self-awareness and freedom."
