  "title": "\"What is the significance of trees in magnetism and the Celtic way of life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of magnetism and its connection with trees in Druid and Celtic tradition. The Marquis de Puysegur used trees to heal, and the tree's crown and branches were symbols of the divine plane of consciousness. The text invites the reader to imagine themselves as Perceval, an initiate to the Chivalry of the Grail, taking contact with nature and bringing their energy from the ground up. It provides exercises to ground oneself and connect with nature, with the goal of achieving enlightenment. The last 200 tokens have a visual representation of the symbols discussed in the text.",
  "content": "Let as an energy coming from the bottom, from your gravity arrive this energy builds your verticality If you are stable nothing can block you. You must know that a knight tried to block Perceval. But Perceval just answered boldly and won You can be affirmative in life. you are now stable Inhale and Exhale and feel yourself grounded on the floor and part of the Nature You are now no more driven by passions, desires and sensations Stay in this feeling for 30 sec minimum WHEN WE RECONNECT TO OUR ENERGY ENLIGHTENMENT BEGINS TO BE THERE WE DECIDE TO KEEP A PART OF IS AWARE OF THAT DONT LET US SUBMERGE AGAIN BY THE ILLUSORY Or a bagwyn Argent mantling azure and vert one knight helmet argent smaller torse gu and or crest one oak or //INT per pale celestial azure and azure estoilly argent //CHIEF on a chief per pale celestial azure and azure estoilly argent a cup or //ORDINARIES a base arched vert //CHARGES in fess-point an alder or in dexter chief a sun in glory or in sinister chief a moon argent smaller in abyss a sword, smaller smaller //EXT mantling or and azure //COMPARTMENT compartment vert much higher higher //CREST crest astral crown or shewn wider shorter //SUPPORTERS supporter a lion-sejant-reguardant orange much smaller wider a bagwyn orange smaller",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, reconnecting with our energy and inner stability can bring us enlightenment and resilience to face any challenge, just like Perceval did. By grounding ourselves and staying connected to nature, we can stay mindful and avoid being overwhelmed by illusions or distractions. The coat of arms described in the text reminds us of the power of celestial symbols and emphasizes the importance of staying grounded with a strong sense of purpose and identity. So let us be like the knight and lion supporters, regal and confident, as we take on life's endeavors."
