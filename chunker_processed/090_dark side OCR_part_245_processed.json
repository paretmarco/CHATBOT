  "title": "\"What is the Dark Side of the Inner Child? Identifying Beliefs and Philosophies to Overcome Resistance.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding section, the focus was on identifying the beliefs and spiritualizations of one's inner child to understand what drives their actions and preferences. The last part of the text delves into the dark side of the inner child, featuring a series of questions that author and therapist John Bradshaw suggests asking the inner child to identify what one may be avoiding by subscribing to a particular philosophy. The text prompts readers to consider what they resist, hide or are unaware of about themselves and to have a dialogue with their inner child to explore deep-seated emotions that guide their behavior.",
