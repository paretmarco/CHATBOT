  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enneagram provides a valuable tool for understanding our compulsions and different personality types. By visualizing each type as a symbol or object, it becomes easier to remember and recognize their corresponding fears and behaviors. In addition, mental associations and self-hypnosis exercises can help us overcome these fears and access our inner senses. Practicing Indian self-hypnosis can further enhance our ability to realize our desires and connect with the universe. With dedication and practice, we can continue to develop and improve our understanding of ourselves and the world around us."
