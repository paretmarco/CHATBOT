  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the focus is on understanding the nature of the self and the stages of experiences. The concept of \"I AM\" and the realization of the self as beyond it is explored, as well as the idea that all experiences have stages of arising, maintaining, ending, and quantumfying. The text introduces exercices to become aware of these stages and the unity of the experiencer and experience. Additionally, the exchange between Wolinsky and Paula contributes to the conversation, as they discuss the different ideas about the \"I\".",
  "content": "Notice that the no-self and the I AM are made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Maybe if you are \"lucky\" the \"NOT-I-I\" of pure awareness will disappear into the VOID, The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology NOT-I-1 EXERCISE #29 All experiencERS and experiences have different stages. By noticing the stage, the experiencer/experience quantumfies. The four stages: 1) Arising, 2) Maintaining, 3) Ending, and 4) Quantumfying. Step I:Notice an experience. Step II:Notice an experiencer. Step III: Notice its stage. Step IV: Experience the experiencer and the experience are the same. Step V:Notice they both disappear into or are noth- ing. ________________ T he \"I\", \"me\" and \"mine\" are the names the body-mind calls itself. It is not you. 180181 Chapter IV Wolinsky:That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea about \"I\". Paula:There is \"I\" and \"Not-l\" . Wolinsky:That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea about the \"I\". Paula:The \"I\" has to do with being important.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the NOT-I-I exercise #29 and understanding that the no-self and the I AM are made of the same substance, you can begin to realize that the concept of \"I\" is nothing more than a mental construct. By noticing the different stages of experiences and acknowledging the impermanence of the self, you can free yourself from the limitations of the ego and move closer to a state of pure awareness."
