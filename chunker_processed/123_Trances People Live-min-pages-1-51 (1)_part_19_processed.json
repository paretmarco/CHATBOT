  "title": "\"What are the core characteristics of trance and examples of common trance states we experience?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text (p. 448), the author highlights the three core characteristics of trance, and in this final part (200 tokens), he invites the readers to explore the various trance states that are not recognized as such. Using relatable examples, the author explains how individuals can experience trance states like a \"beach trance,\" \"phobia trance,\" and a \"cute-kitty trance\" in their daily lives. However, the crucial factor in all these trance experiences is that they have a beginning, middle, and endpoint, and the individual is the common factor in all these comings and goings of different trances.",
  "content": "Unbeknownst to your friends, you are phobic about actually being in the water, and you begin to panic and feel like you are drowning (phobia trance). You survive this ordeal, pack up and begin to walk home, whereupon you come across a teenager trying to give away several kittens. You stop dead in your tracks, pick up one of the kittens and begin talking like a five-year-old. You are so enchanted by the kitten that you spend 30 minutes there, talking \"kitty-talk\" and being completely oblivious to the time (kitty trance). You get home and promptly get into a fight with your partner in which you both scream and yell for 30 minutes because you were late (fight trance). Then you make up and cuddle, kiss, and tell each other how much you love one another for an hour (love trance). There are two common factors in all of these trance experiences. The first is that each one had a beginning point, a middle, and an endpoint â€” which means that you are the one common factor in the comings and goings of these particular trances.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our experiences are not just a series of isolated events but rather a cluster of trance phenomena that occur in a specific sequence. Being aware of these phenomena can help us understand how our minds work and how we can use them to our advantage. Whether we're enjoying a pleasant experience, coping with an unpleasant one, or simply captivated by a cute kitten, paying attention to the phenomena that come over us can help us better understand ourselves and our reactions."
