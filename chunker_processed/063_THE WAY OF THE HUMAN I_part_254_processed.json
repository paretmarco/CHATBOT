  "title": "Why is it impossible to overcome your animal nature? Exploring the concept of spiritualization and anthropomorphization through the lens of Quantum Psychology.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explored how repression in spiritual systems can lead to the deification or demonization of external figures. Now, the author introduces the concept of quantum psychology, which challenges the idea that we must overcome our animal nature. This principle suggests that we can gain a different understanding of our relationships by viewing them through the lens of the animal dimension. The author goes on to illustrate this point by examining a hypothetical business arrangement.",
  "content": "The bodily functions once repressed, however, comes out in \"less appropriate,\" out-of-context ways (like priests molesting children). Parents often say to children, \"What inside of you makes you act this way?\" Quantum. Psychology says \"It is the repressed animal.\" QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You can never overcome your animal nature. You cannot overcome your animal nature, it is not possible, and why should you even want to? As an exercise, Quantum Psychology suggests viewing life through the animal dimension. If you look at your relationships with people, you can view them through several lenses. For example, if I view people situations, people and my relationship to them, etc., through the lens of my thinking dimension, I will get one understanding. If I view this through the emotional level, I will get another. If I view my relationships through the animal dimension, however, I will get a yet another different understanding. Let's say I get into an argument in a business arrangement and feel, that they want me to sign a contract so they'll own me.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, according to Quantum Psychology, our animal nature cannot be overcome. By viewing our relationships and interactions through the animal dimension, we can gain a better understanding of our biological impulses and reactions. This perspective can help us navigate situations with greater clarity and less self-judgment, ultimately leading to more harmonious relationships and a greater acceptance of our primal instincts."
