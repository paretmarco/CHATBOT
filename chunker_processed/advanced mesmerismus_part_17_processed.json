  "first_phrase": "The last part of the text delves into different techniques and methods used in hypnotherapy, primarily focusing on non-verbal communication and magnetism. It includes demonstrations and exercises aimed at developing skills such as sound and magnetic passes, fluidification, and hypnodrama. The text also explores the concept of non-verbal hypnosis and its efficacy in creating a crisis-free version of hypnotherapy. Additionally, the text introduces the idea of using water in self-hypnosis.",
  "content": "He highly valued the work of Mesmer and he feels what he did was on his line He used music to create release state We agree with many of his tenets, but we prefer to use non verbal hypnotism as it is more corresponding to what we do Procedure: Begin with Trabona method a little to create a state of disposition Have the person look at a light and thinking what s/he desires. begin the movement (when looking at a light only back and forth, otherwise the trace will be not so good) and at a certain point ask her to breath from the nose and exhale from the mouth After have the person close the eyes - begin as in Trabona method Continue with non-verbal stimulations This method will create as a crisis but with a different way of doing. It is very good for self-hypnosis. We can create a movement similar to the crisis even without the negative emotion that normally we use to go in regression create catalepsy and after solve it ================================================== DEMONSTRATION OF MAGNETISM FOR WEIGHT LOSS ================================================== SELF HYPNOSIS WITH WATER Attentive explanation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetism is a powerful tool for self-hypnosis and healing. By using techniques such as the Trabona method, passes, and nonverbal stimulations, one can create a deep trance and work on both nervous and endocrine systems. It's important to understand the different types of activation and personality, as well as the archetypal and derivative symbolism, to adapt to each client and create a balanced reaction. Through exercises like the mirror exercise of de-identification and the Enneagram, we can put away false identifications and understand our compulsions, ultimately leading us to our essence at the center of the circle."
