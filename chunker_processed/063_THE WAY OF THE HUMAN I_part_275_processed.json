  "title": "\"Why do psychology and spirituality fail to solve pain and its false cause?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses how attempts to deal with pain through therapy or spirituality may lead to false conclusions and solutions. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces the concept of the \"False Core\" and how it manifests as a feeling of having no control. The author explains that this feeling arises due to societal attempts to control our basic animal instincts during the socialization process, leading to the formation of a superego that we mistakenly identify with. The author argues that age-regressed philosophies and spiritual practices seek to justify this controlling of our animal instincts as a means to merge with a greater unity such as God or society. However, this belief can ultimately lead to pain and suffering as individuals struggle to control themselves and their situations, leading to a collapse of levels.",
  "content": "For example, \"If I can control this (animal), God (morn/ dad) will reward me (maybe with enlightenment, or a new bike).\" If I control emotions and create new beliefs I can get what I want from the external. In short, be able to merge (i.e., with the unity, Morn/ Dad). If I can control this animal, then I will get love and acceptance which means I will be able to merge (be one and not separate from Mom/Dad etc.). This is an underlying belief from infancy. \"If I can control my biological urges, I can control another,\" or \"If I can control my biological urges,\" I can control what the external world gives me (Mom/Dad later spiritualized as God or guru giving enlightenment for being good) and how the world responds to me. But notice how much pain you go through because you can't control the situation or another by controlling yourself (the animal). This is the collapsing of the levels.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing and addressing our fundamental beliefs about control can help avoid pain and chaos in our lives. We must let go of the false notion that we can control others through controlling ourselves and instead learn to accept our own animal nature and connect with others on a deeper level. This is a crucial step in our personal growth and development."
