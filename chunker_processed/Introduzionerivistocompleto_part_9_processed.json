  "content": "He became the best communicator of his time even though he had difficulty in speaking. He believed in life and in love, seen by him as a great value. United with passion and positivism, they are the best conditions to learn NPL in the best way possible. Minds that work well are those that produce satisfactory results which are also visible to others!!!! Milton Erickson was a hymn to life! To be able to overcome his difficulties he found himself faced with a challenge, and the result of his challenge was Neuro-linguistic programming. In fact, the first NLP originated from the comprehension. It was carried out by a study group at the Santa Cruz University (California) and its strategies have been used by many successful communicators. The modeling of M. Erikson played a fundamental role in this development. We are the ones who, being born and raised in a culture which considers life a “valley of tears”, think that the moment something good happens, it is down to good luck. A dull life, without emotions or memorable events, is considered normal. Thus, with this widespread conviction, it becomes logical that existence continues in this “dullness”, because the brain is a learning machine and energy follows thought. In other words, we allow ourselves to be driven between euphoria and sadness when in reality we are the owners of the way we think. Think positive and exciting thoughts if you want to have a happy and stimulating life! Think negative thoughts and you will have a life full of troubles and regrets.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a powerful tool for personal and professional development that can help individuals improve communication skills, increase self-confidence, and achieve their goals. One key aspect of NLP is creating instant rapport with others through techniques like mirroring. Non-verbal communication is also important for understanding others and communicating effectively. By mastering these skills, individuals can unlock their full potential and live more fulfilling lives. Remember that the key to success is positive thinking, motivation, and enthusiasm!"
