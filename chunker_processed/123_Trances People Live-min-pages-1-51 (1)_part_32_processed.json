  "title": "\"How do childhood trauma and hypnotic states affect adult behavior and sexual response?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how children create trance states that help them cope with experiences that are too challenging to process. These experiences can be traumatic, but they don't have to be. Each child has a unique proclivity towards creating certain trance states, which is why adults experience hypnosis differently. The Deep Trance Phenomenon is used by children to protect themselves and create automatic responses to their environment. However, as adults, these responses can prevent them from being present and connecting with others. The example of a young girl who was molested by her father is used to illustrate how children create responses during the traumatic experience and how this can impact their lives as adults.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is evident that the I?cep Ti al Ice Phenomenon is a coping mechanism that can have long-term effects on an individual's psychological well-being. The use of trance states, dissociation, and amnesia to escape trauma can lead to sexual difficulties, such as non-orgasmic behavior. It is vital to seek professional help to address these issues and develop healthy coping mechanisms for a better quality of life."
