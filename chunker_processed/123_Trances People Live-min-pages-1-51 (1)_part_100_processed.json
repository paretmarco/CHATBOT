  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, Erickson's perspective on the importance of intention in therapy was discussed. Acknowledging both intentions and counter-intentions helps to align therapist and client in a co-operative therapeutic venture. In this final section, the author emphasizes the significance of being aware of one's own feelings, associations and intentions in therapy. By acknowledging them and creating a safe space for change to occur, the therapist can expand their own inner context and facilitate growth in themselves and their clients. The author also underscores the importance of moving beyond the identity of the therapist as a rigid role and instead seeing therapist and client as equals.",

  "last_phrase": "Therapists and clients are equals in the growth process, and it's essential for therapists to acknowledge their own thoughts and feelings. By integrating the understanding that there is no difference between the therapist and the client, therapists can expand their inner context and better serve their clients. It's time to move beyond rigid role definitions and embrace co-transference as a means of growth for everyone involved."
