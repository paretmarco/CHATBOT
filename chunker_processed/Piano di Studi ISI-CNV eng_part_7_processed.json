  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, we delve into the Magnetic Path and Magnetism/Fascination updated to quantum techniques. The school offers various paths such as the Certified Hypnotherapist and Advanced Mesmerist certification, Magnetic Massage Certification, and more. Before this, the text discussed the practical experience, theoretical competence, and various measurements taken to develop a system for human growth and potential. The text also highlights the importance of the \"human factor\" in organizations and a true \"Quantum Coaching.\" The Two Fundamental Ways for the Development of the Person - Path A (direct) and Path B (indirect) are explored as well.",
  "content": "This has consequences: In an organization it becomes clear how every performance is linked to the \"human factor\" and the \"sense\" that people feels in the organization. Our system is also the key to the realization of a true \"Quantum Coaching\" At therapeutic levels, we realize that beyond the various techniques there is a person with which we operate and resonate and the relationship should take this into account, as well as the fact that we are a person and therefore we influence the results On a personal level, we open up to the two ways of human development: The Two Fundamental ways for the Development of the Person There are two avenues of growth for the human being: path A and path B - The direct path (path A) is the “heroic” path. For those who want to go directly to the deepest of themselves, to get the most high state of consciousness that a human being can live. - The indirect path (path B) also called “magical” path, is for people who do not have the concentration and the energy to do so because they are too distracted by daily life and therefore they want to achieve some goals (eg, success, health, money, relationships) before to have enough energy to follow the path A. We accept the fact that each has his own way of seeing the world. It is a technique of freedom.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the path of human development has two fundamental ways: the direct path (path A) and the indirect path (path B). While the direct path is for those who seek to achieve the highest state of consciousness, the indirect path is for those who want to achieve specific goals before having enough energy to follow the direct path. It is essential to keep in mind that every performance in an organization is linked to the \"human factor,\" and the development of the person is vital for any personal or professional success. Quantum coaching and techniques like Mesmerismus® and Fascination can significantly enhance persuasion and healing abilities if practiced thoughtfully and with respect to tradition and lineage. The concept of \"Alchemy of Light\" can be used as a tool to aid human transformation and achieve the ultimate degree of \"Reintegration in the presence.\""
