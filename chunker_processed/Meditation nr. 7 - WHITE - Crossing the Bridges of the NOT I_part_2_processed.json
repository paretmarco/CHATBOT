  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about Clairvoyance and how it allows us to transcend time and space, accessing higher levels of intuition. This section focuses on an exercise that opens up a magnetic energy connected to the body, leading to the Temple of Solomon and the Graal. The Temple and Graal are symbolic representations of the human body and the energy we carry within. By passing through the three gates of the temple and letting go of our attachments, we can access enlightenment. This text also mentions the story of Perceval meeting a white woman and seeing the Graal. Finally, we learn about two bridges toward the \"not I.\"",
  "content": "This energy to awake We have three Gates to pass through and after we will be at the temple These are the three parts of our body PART 2 Inhale and let go every image from the top of your head Bad, good, no importance Let yourself go into an ecstasy (Repeat this exercise) The Graal Castle is a symbolic representation of the temple of Solomon in Jerusalem These three gates are different level of consciousness You are at the door and you should enter without pride.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey towards enlightenment is not an easy one, but it is a rewarding one. It requires passing through three gates of consciousness, and the willingness to let go of illusions and attachments. The Glass Bridge and Rotating Bridge represent significant milestones in this journey, allowing us to progress to higher levels of awareness and perception. The initiation of the Crystal Palace leads to transcendental vision, which is characterized by increased visual acuity, inner visions, and vivid dreams. By embracing the challenges and changes that come with this process, we can experience the profound transformation that enables us to reach our full potential."
