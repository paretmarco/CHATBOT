  "title": "\"How can quantum techniques and personality substitution help in multiplying ideas?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author introduced the idea of using light as a means for multiplying and implementing our own ideas. This idea is deeply connected with the techniques used for making ourselves magnetic, which are further discussed in the upcoming chapter. In this last part, the author suggests combining presentification with personality substitution to anticipate an action as if it is carried out by someone else. This may seem magical, but it has a scientific basis rooted in the physical-psychological correlation. By adopting a specific expressive posture of the face and the body, our spirit eventually takes over the state that corresponds to the expression.",
  "content": "What we call «substitution of personality» is that part of a process which consists in imagining an action as if it has been carried out, not by ourselves, but by some other person, whose spirit, abilities and praiseworthy features have penetrated our own selves, and which we then exploit so as to implement that action in the best possible way. This procedure, — which might appear to be something magical and odd —, is however endowed with a scientific basis that might be defined as follows: When we physically represent ourselves as being a specific person we are personally familiar with, one we imagine to be in need of undertaking a particular action, our psychological state undergoes a transformation by identifying it with the state of the selected “substitute” individual. That will occur to a greater or lesser extent depending on the intensity of our mental representation. What we are dealing with, in short, is the well known physical-psychological correlation pursuant to which, by adopting a specific expressive posture of the face and the body, our spirit eventually comes to take over, step after step, the very state which corresponds to the relevant expression 65.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, utilizing the technique of substitution of personality can assist us in achieving success in various scenarios. By mentally adopting qualities and abilities of others, we can transform our own psychological state and perform at our best. However, it is important to note that we are not trying to model someone else, but only using their traits as a guide to enhance our own skills. Practicing this method can help us achieve our goals and reach our full potential."
