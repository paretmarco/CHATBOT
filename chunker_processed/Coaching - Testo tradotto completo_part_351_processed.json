  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the focus is on the culminating phase of a method to materialize an idea in the body. The reader is advised to study the preceding paragraphs carefully and to ensure that the spiritual component is implemented precisely. The next phase involves a shift of attention to mental assimilation of the formula while in the bedroom, in a state of mental inertia. The idea merges with the body and forms a unified amalgam in which the body divests itself of time, becoming the ideal support for entrenching the new idea. The section ends with instructions on antero/posterior activation.",
  "content": "Subsequent phase If it is time to go and sleep, you might shift your attention to the assimilation of the formula while inside your own bedroom, in such a manner that you will be required to move as little as possible. It is nevertheless recommended to be in a state of mental inertia, one comparable in nature to muscular relaxation. We have finally arrived at the culminating point of our method. The phase we shall go through now is a phase where our idea gains access to a new dimension. This is a dimension in which the idea merges with the body and forms with it a unified amalgam: Our idea “materializes itself”. The body divests itself of time, whereupon it comes to represent the ideal support to the task of entrenching the new idea. Darkness and Magnetization As soon as you are in bed or you are seated on a couch, watch a light and mentally repeat your formula once more. Antero/Posterior Activation 84. Now, gently rub the palm of one hand against the other one, until such point when both of them are warmed up. Thereupon, lay the palm of your right hand behind the head, on the cerebellum.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the aforementioned steps, you can effectively materialize your idea into reality with the help of subconscious assimilation and physical formative actions. Use the power of darkness and magnetization, along with antero/posterior activation and energy spread to create a holistic approach towards achieving your goals."
