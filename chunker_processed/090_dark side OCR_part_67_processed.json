  "title": "How does the inner child's fantasies affect present experiences in adults?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how the inner child within adults can project past catastrophes into the future or fantasize about idealized outcomes. This can lead to a disconnection from present reality and cause frustration and pain. One woman, for instance, felt frustrated with her partner because she imagined him taking care of her in the future, while a man had to imagine a better future to cope with poverty as a child. These \"trances\" occur because the child's chaos creates a fantasy to feel less overwhelmed.",
  "content": "She felt frustrated because, outside of her awareness, the dark side of the inner child was hypnotizing the present-time adult, making her believe that this was supposed to happenâ€”hence the adult in present time f'elt frustrated and angry at her partner for not taking care of her. The important thing to note is that with each style of futurizing the adult shifts from a present-time reality, to the inner-child reality that trance-fers the past to the future. In futurizing, so strong is the trance of the inner child that the adult believes the future is the past. Why do these \"trances\" occur? A child in a stressful situation often feels confused, overwhelmed, crazy or chaotic. In that chaos, the observer creates a fantasy that helps dissipate the feeling of chaos. For example, I was seeing a woman for therapy who, as a little girl, had to take care of her physically ill Dad. She felt trapped. Her survival mechanism was to imagine a wonderful man taking her away from all of this, thus the feelings of being overwhelmed dissipated. A gentleman I was seeing for therapy, had lived as a small boy in a poverty-stricken situation.",
  "last_phrase": "It's important to be aware of our inner child and the trances we create to handle past stressful situations that may limit our present and future growth. Recognizing these patterns can help us break free from the cycle and make healthier choices for ourselves."
