  "title": "What is characterological counter-transference and how does it affect therapist-client relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of trance-ference and counter-trance-ference, focusing on therapists and teachers who may be in a state of characterological or integrated trance-ference. In the last 200 tokens, the author expands the discussion to include other types of relationships affected by trance-ference, emphasizing the age-regressed state and lack of awareness that causes individuals to relate to an internalized, past-time other. The author argues that awareness is crucial to avoid these patterns of behavior that can lead to characterological disorders.",
  "content": "Two people might be behaving in a power-tripping way (i.e., being manipulative). The first person is aware of what therare doing, feels bad about it, but cannot stop it. The second person is not aware of what they are doing, and hence, doesn't feel bad about it. The first person's process is not characterological because they feel bad and have awareness; the second person's is characterological because they not only feel no remorse, but they are unaware of their process. Not being aware and feeling no remorse are hallmarks of a characterological disorder. TRANCE-FERENCUCOLINTER-TRANCE-FERENCE RELATIONSHIPS At this point, I would like to expand the parameters of tranceference/counter-trance-ference to include not only therapist/client, teacher/student or guru/disciple, but many of our other relationships. Once again, we need to look back on our definition of trance-ference as an age-regressed state, with a lack of awareness by an individual. This causes him or her to move from the present-time to the past-time self and, consequently, relating to an internalized—rather than a present-time—other. The past-time self has associations, emotions and memories, and transfers them onto the present-time other. When this occurs awareness goes to sleep.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, being aware of our behavior and feelings is crucial in distinguishing between a characterological disorder and a temporary age-regression state. Expanding the concept of tranceference/counter-transference to our daily relationships can increase our awareness and help us build healthier connections with ourselves and others."
