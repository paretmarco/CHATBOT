  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of shrinking one's focus of attention or identifying with a limited aspect of oneself, which can lead to feeling overpowered by problems such as depression. To overcome this, the author suggests expanding one's context of perception by using the example of viewing one's consciousness like a library and retrieving particular sections. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing oneself as the knower, and the therapist plays a vital role in helping the client observe and identify their limiting identification. By expanding their context of perception, the individual can begin to transform and develop a more dynamic perspective.",

  "last_phrase": "To overcome the feeling of being overpowered by depression or any other problem, it is essential to understand that you are the knower and the phenomena are the vehicles of your consciousness. By expanding your context and observing your misidentifications, you can create new identities and overcome the separation from your true self. By practicing self-observation and seeking therapy, you can take the first step towards a more fulfilling life. Remember, you are not your problems, but the observer of them."
