  "title": "\"What is Illusioning and How Does it Impact Our Perception of Reality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the focus is on the phenomenon of illusioning or the selective trances of the inner child, as described by the American College Dictionary. The author uses John Lennon's lyrics as an example of how illusioning can create painful trances for adults in present time, based on misinterpretations of past events. The dark side of the inner child can set up internal, subjective experiences that interfere with present time reality. The child within selects and overlays past events onto present or future situations, often magnifying them. Illusioning requires a shrinking of focus of attention, similar to blocking-out.",
  "content": "This dark side of the frozen inner child sets up internal, subjective experi- ences, some of which are based on present time information, but some of which are just free floating illusions from the past, that confuse, interfere with, and misinterpret present time reality. In selective trances, the child within selects what was, or occurred in the past, and overlays it on the present or future. For example, a child whose father was dysfunctional is told by his mother (the hypnotist) how much Dad cares because he remem- bered a birthday, rather than acknowledging that Dad's been drinking every day this month and just happened to do one nice thing. Years later, the child within the adult marries an alcoholic and selects the one nice event and magnifies it. This selective trance mirrors the earlier trance suggested by Mom. In illusioning, what is seen is not there, or more commonly, what is there is magnified as if it were the whole picture. It is similar to its complement, blocking-out, in that both trances require a shrinking of the focus of attention.",
  "last_phrase": "To avoid falling into the trap of illusioning and blocking-out, it's important to stay aware of our selective trances and focus on the bigger picture. While it may be tempting to magnify the positive, it's crucial to acknowledge and address negative behaviors and patterns to promote true healing and growth. By being mindful of our inner child and the influence of past experiences, we can cultivate a more accurate and meaningful understanding of present reality."
