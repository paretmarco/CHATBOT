  "title": "\"How do we develop and maintain multi-dimensional awareness according to Quantum Psychology principles?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, we discover how to maintain multi-dimensional awareness, answering the frequently asked question of how to maintain humanness while spiritually connected. By splitting attention and becoming aware of various dimensions - including the external world, thinking, emotional process, animal nature, and beyond - we can enter into the \"ESSENCE-I AM-or-NOT-I-I,\" eventually reaching the \"NOT-H\" and pure awareness. This section builds upon the ideas of collective archetypes and the contraction of the No-State The Way of the Human to explore the principles of Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "For example, if you place your attention solely on an object, then you are using one-dimensional awareness. When \"you\" split awareness, dividing it half inward (noticing your thinking process) and half outward, \"you\" are exhibiting two-dimensional awareness. If \"you\" split attention 1/3 outward, 1/3 on thinking and 1/3 on your emotional dimension, you are exhibiting three-dimensional awareness. If \"YOU\" split attention 1/4 outward, 1/4 on thinking, 1/4 on your emotional nature, and 1/4 biologically, \"you begin to enter into ESSENCE-I AM-or-NOT-I-I\" which is beyond the observer-observed dyad. Then \"you\" are experiencing four-dimensional awareness. The next step is when awareness is split 1/5 on the external world, 1/5 on the thinking, 1/5 on the emotional process, 1/5 on your animal nature, and 1/5 on the ESSENCE. Finally, we go beyond into the I AM and eventually into the \"NOT-H\", which is not observingâ€”but WITNESSING the observer-observed dyad while being aware of the VOID and as pure awareness. 64 Chapter 1V The question then emerges: \"How do we become aware of and maintain all of these dimensions simultaneously?\" This next section deals with just this issue.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to discover \"WHO YOU ARE,\" you must liberate your awareness and develop the ability to maintain multi-dimensional awareness. This process involves collapsing the levels of manifestation and awareness discussed in earlier chapters, and ultimately going beyond awareness itself. By deepening and cultivating your awareness of all eight dimensions of your humanness, you can achieve a state of pure awareness where you witness the observer-observed dyad while being aware of the VOID."
