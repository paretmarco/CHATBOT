  "title": "\"What is the relationship between labeling and perceiving essence as emptiness causing an existential crisis?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores how ESSENCE, which is perceived as the cause of all problems, is actually mislabeled as emptiness due to the False Core Driver and Identities. This misperception leads to the existential crisis and the desire to organize chaos. The reason for not experiencing ESSENCE is because it is labeled as False Core. Quantum Psychology sees the Archetypical Shadow as the resisted parts of the id. ESSENCE contains Essential qualities like love, observation, spaciousness, compassion, freedom, etc., with the no state state or I AM being beyond all qualities (to be discussed next).",
  "content": "The reason you do not experience your ESSENCE is because the label placed on it and the Essential quality of pure spaciousness are fused with your False Core. In other words, your ESSENCE is labeled as your False Core and the reason why there was a separation from the mother which eventually is trancefered onto everyone else, including the world and God. When we say it is the reason, actually it is blamed and then remains unknown that: it is the label placed on the SPACIOUSNESS of ESSENCE which then causes it to be (mis)perceived as emptiness as in a lack. Still ESSENCE is who they are essentially. Quantum Psychology sees Jung's Archetypical Shadow as not an Archetype at all, but rather as resisted parts of the id, which is then spiritualized during the creation of the persona (to be discussed later). 3 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology ESSENTIAL QUALITIES ESSENCE contains Essential qualities like love'with no object, observation with no object, spaciousness, compassion, peace, freedom, etc. Beyond all qualities is the no state state or I AM (see next chapter).",
  "last_phrase": "In order to access your deepest self and the Essential qualities that you contain within you, it is important to understand that the label placed on your ESSENCE and the fusion with your False Core can cause a misperception of emptiness or lack. The creation of identities and the focus on the external dimension can also diminish your awareness of your true self. By recognizing and releasing these false perceptions, you can rediscover your pure spaciousness and the Essential qualities that make up your ESSENCE."
