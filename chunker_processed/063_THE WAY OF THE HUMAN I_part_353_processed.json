  "title": "What is characterological disorder and how does it relate to trance-ference and counter-trance-ference relationships in daily life?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explained the difference between characterological and process-like manipulative behavior, with one person being aware and feeling remorse, while the other is not. The focus now shifts to the concept of trance-ference and counter-trance-ference in various relationships, including therapist/client, teacher/student, and guru/disciple. The author emphasizes how age-regression can cause individuals to relate to an internalized other, which can manifest as an age-regressed trance-ference. The text also delves into the example of a woman who expects her husband and the universe to take care of her, which is an age-regressed philosophy. The author also raises the question of why some people become age-regressed while others mature into all-knowing adults.",
  "content": "It should also be noted that most people are adults in present time but, at varying points or situations, they often become age-regressed. However, I have met integrated age-regressed people who are never adults in present time but are always acting and seeing the world as children. I saw a woman for therapy who always expected her husband and the universe (her husband-daddy-mommy) to \"take care\" of her. This so eclipsed her life that she would not work even 227 he Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness hough they had little money. This was an age-regressed trance-ference of parents on her husband and on the world. It is appropriate to expect your parents to provide for you, but the New Age \"the universe (morn/dad) will provide\" or \"take care of me\" is an integrated age-regressed philosophy. In India, we used to say, \"It is true that the universe will take care of you, but it might not take care of you the way you want or imagine that you should be taken care of.\" Why do some people become the age-regressed child while others the all-knowing adult?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to recognize that age-regression can affect individuals differently, and it is not uncommon for some to become fully integrated age-regressed individuals. However, it's important to understand that relying solely on others to \"take care\" of us or placing our expectations on the universe can lead to counter-tranceference and adversely impact our lives. Ultimately, obtaining a multi-dimensional awareness can help us navigate these deeply ingrained patterns and relationships."
