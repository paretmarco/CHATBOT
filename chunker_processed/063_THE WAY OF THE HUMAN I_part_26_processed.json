  "title": "What is Multi-dimensional Awareness in Quantum Psychology and how does it facilitate Self-Actualization and Self-Realization?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the importance of developing multidimensional awareness as the meeting point of self-actualization and self-realization. The author explains that by embracing all parts of human nature, including the biological, psychological, and spiritual, and their limitations, individuals can achieve a functional awareness that leads to the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is presented as a path to maintaining awareness at all levels without exclusion but with total inclusion. In the last part (200 tokens), the author will discuss the various dimensions of awareness in more detail.",
  "content": "This will enable us to develop a multi-dimensional functional awareness which leads to the underlying unity which \"I\" call our quantum nature. How does one fully integrate, develop, and reach what is so adamantly sought by the human potential movement and the spiritual aspirants of the East? Simply stated: Where do self-actualization and self realization meet? They meet in the development of multidimensional awareness as a possible aid to discovering \"WHO YOU ARE\" without negating or losing any part of human nature which includes the world which is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. The challenge is in being human as both a biological and psychological (thinking) emotional being, without losing our loving ESSENCE or the awareness of the underlying unity of the VOID (NOT-I-I) which is Quantum Consciousness. The Way of the Human asks us to do just that, to be fully human and develop our multidimensional awareness as a possible aid to discovering WHO WE ARE; in other words, to maintain awareness at all levels without exclusion but with total inclusion. The Way of the Human is where SELF-REALIZATION and SELF-ACTUALIZATION meet. ________________ Chapter 1 Throughout all three books, \"I\" will talk about dimensions of awareness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by developing a multidimensional functional awareness, we can discover who we truly are without negating any part of our human nature. The Way of the Human emphasizes maintaining awareness at all levels, without exclusion but with total inclusion. This increases our subjective experience of freedom and leads to the liberation of awareness. Remember, denying and hating any part of our human nature is a misunderstanding of the manifestation of the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness."
