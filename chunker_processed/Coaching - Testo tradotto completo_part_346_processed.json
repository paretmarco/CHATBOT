  "title": "\"What is the materialization of desire and how can one define the formula for its achievement?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text on materializing desires, the author provides specific guidelines on the method to absorb desired ideas through the support of one's body. By defining the true self and using a verbal formula, the author explains how habits and behavior patterns can be altered, leading to the actualization of new realities. The formula must be affirmative and concise, focusing on a testimony of faith. The preparation involves settling in an environment with a mirror and writing the formula down in large letters. The paper must be upright and at eye level while being comfortably read while leaning back on a chair or couch.",
  "content": "The two general rules that ought to govern the articulation of our formula are as follows: 1 The formula must be an affirmative one in the present tense. – We must not say, for example: «I will never be sad again», but rather something in the vein of «I am in a good mood». 2 The formula must be exceedingly short. We must in fact focus our thought on an asseveration, as a testimony of faith. The entire testimony of faith of Christian people is condensed in a single word: I BELIEVE. General Preparation and Method How to ready the environment a) Put yourselves in an environment which is equipped with a mirror. b) Once you have settled on your favourite formula 81, write it down on a piece of paper, in very large characters. Place the piece of paper vertically. The sheet of paper must remain in an upright position through the help of a book or some other form of support. The paper must be at the same level as your eyes, at a distance, moreover, which enables you to read it comfortably while your head leans against the back of your chair, better still your couch.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to prepare for achievement and manifesting positive affirmations, it's important to create short, present-tense statements and display them prominently in a well-lit area with a mirror and drink nearby. By focusing your thoughts on your testimony of faith, you can cultivate a sense of belief and positivity."
