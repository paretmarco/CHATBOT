  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed two methods for achieving self-improvement. Method 2, which is suited for character transformation, involves a preparatory phase of being present and conscious of one's desires. The author emphasizes the importance of making a global declaration that the exercise will work before proceeding with the basic exercise. This exercise can either be done in front of a mirror or through relaxation and visualization. The author suggests using \"I\" and \"you\" pronouns and being descriptive while maintaining a present-focused mindset. This method is intended to help individuals accomplish their desired results through self-magnetism.",
  "content": "You must say to your own selves that you want, and are both able and determined to apply the methodology for the sake of your self-improvement 77. Basic exercise This exercise can be carried out in one of two possible ways: Either in front of a mirror, or through a light relaxation and on the strength of a calm breathing, the eyes closed, while you visualize the present which you desire to see actualized. The first way is, however, the most effective, simple and fast 78. Looking at yourselves in the mirror is as if you were conversing with a friend, and you succeed in persuading him. Take it easy, exit the time of urgency, and be in the time of the present, in some “beginning”. Alternate the use of the pronoun “I” and the pronoun “you”. As you keep on watching yourselves, you are going to say to yourselves now and end “you can do”, while on other occasions you are going to utter to yourselves, “yes, I can do”. Be colourful in your expressions, and describe the state which can be reached in a clear manner.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember, the key to self-improvement is adopting a methodology that works for you. Try the basic exercise of looking at yourself in the mirror and visualizing your desired reality with confidence. Incorporate the use of \"I\" and \"you,\" and remember the sequences \"I can - I want - I decide\" to help construct your present and achieve your goals. With dedication and practice, you can make every day a marvelous day full of energy!"
