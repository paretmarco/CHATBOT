  "title": "\"How to Implement Projection and Scanning Techniques for Manifestation and Self-Improvement?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the importance of accessing the world of \"universal beings\" and defining one's desires before embarking on the creation of a new reality, through a process known as projection. In the last 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the process of projection by activating the plane of possibilities and transmitting mental representations to manifest desires. The author also discusses alternative methodologies such as self-magnetization and pleading with the universe. It is emphasized that the goal is not merely to attract things that might not even be needed, but rather to improve oneself and achieve tangible outcomes.",
  "content": "Though seclusion facilitates projection, when one is properly trained he might be able to isolate himself and plunge into mono-ideation even in the middle of a crowd, by losing any connection with what surrounds him. How to implement Projection: This second exercise consists in daily activating the plane of possibilities (virtuality), by transmitting to such plane a number of mental representations accompanied by imperious acts of volition which are directed at their actualization. One can also legitimately make use of multi-stage methodologies, such as self-magnetization as previously elucidated. Alternatively, you might simply contemplate your own ideation and say to yourselves: “Here is what I desire, which is, moreover, something that is bound to be accomplished” —, meaning in a tangibly embodied form. You must feel it as an actual fact, as something which is already in existence. An additional way, which acquires similar validity the more you gradually become more present to your own selves, might even consist in simply pleading with the universe to enable the full manifestation of your potential. Potentially, in fact, you are already a “homo totus”, equipped as such with the totality of possibilities and capacities you need in order to achieve what you want.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, implementing the exercise of projection requires consistent daily activation of the plane of possibilities and maintaining a mental attitude that harmonizes with natural elements to ensure the actualization of volitional urges. Additionally, dedicating time to affirmations that promote physical and moral well-being is crucial. Errors may occur, but with continuous self-control, one can minimize them and achieve their desired potential."
