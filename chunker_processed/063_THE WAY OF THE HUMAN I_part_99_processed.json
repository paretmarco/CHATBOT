  "title": "\"Why is Body-Work Essential in Quantum Psychology and Trauma Healing?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the limitations of diagnosis and typing systems such as the False Core-False Self, the Enneagram, and the DSM-IV of psychology. They argue that these are constructions of the nervous system and do not reveal the underlying unity of consciousness. The author proposes the deconstruction of concepts and disidentification from one's False Core Driver and False Self Compensator to move towards Quantum Consciousness. However, Quantum Psychology has some weak points, especially in addressing the external world and the physical body. Therefore, the author recommends the integration of hands-on \"body-work\" alongside Quantum Psychology practice.",
  "content": "But if you believe there is a \"bad\" part of the False Core-False Self and you try to focus on the \"good\" part, you keep the Chapter II with the omniscient magical mommy, and represents the teacher's grandiosity and counter-transeference. Likewise, a system or technique can be imagined to do it all. The occurs when the system or technique becomes magical mommy or the tranformational object (technique) of the pre-verbal nonrepresentational infant (see Volume I, The Special Section, Trances People Live: Revisited). Quantum Psychology has some very clear weak suits. One of them is the external world. The other is the physical body, although the work itself does contain a lot of enquiry directed at the body. The body needs a \"hands on\" approach. Body-work should deal with what Ida Rolf calls the BIOLOGICAL CORE (see Chapter VIII). Secondly, \"bodywork\" is needed in order to process and address the material in the physical body. For these reasons, Quantum Psychology recommends that people get some hands-on \"body-work.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while Quantum Psychology offers powerful tools for exploring and transforming the psychological aspects of our being, it's important to recognize and address the limitations in dealing with the external world and physical body. Adding a \"hands-on\" body-work approach is recommended to help process and address the material stored in the body, especially for those who have experienced trauma. This can lead to a greater sense of liberation and freedom from body memories, creating a more integrated and whole self."
