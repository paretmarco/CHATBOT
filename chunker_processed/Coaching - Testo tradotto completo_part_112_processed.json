  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author recommends techniques for improving mental focus and physical relaxation. In the final 200 tokens, he explains the importance of detaching oneself from thought and experiencing true silence in order to accumulate personal magnetism. The author suggests that consciously awakening our unconscious side and practicing the art of detachment through daily effort can lead to increased intensity in relishing life. He clarifies that the ability not to think about anything is different from absent-mindedness, and provides insights on the law of activity and rest.",
  "content": "Becoming accustomed to relaxation leads a person to relish life with increased intensity. What it means is that pleasures are renewed for him more frequently and acquire greater liveliness, as a natural consequence of the law in terms of which activity represents a pleasing experience only when it excites faculties which have been turned wholesome by rest 32. In the event that we desire a further development of this quality, the fact that thoughts are things, and that their emanation is escorted by a release of strength, implies that in order to accumulate personal magnetism it is necessary not only to know how to think, that is, to be able to regulate the course of thoughts at oneâ€™s own convenience, but also, at some moments, to know how not to think of anything. Provided that we succeed, whether for a longer or a shorter period, in fully stopping our thoughts from issuing forth, it might be likely that the repairing of our strengths is going to materialize far more quickly. The prior mastery of such a requisite is however demanded. The ability not to think about anything is significantly different from absent-mindedness. In almost every instance, we unwittingly shift from one idea to another.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning how to regulate our thoughts and achieve moments of mental void can help us accumulate personal magnetism, increase our energy levels, and relish life with renewed pleasures. Practicing this requisite might require effort and mastery, but it can lead to a more fulfilling and energetic life. To achieve a mental void, we must not confuse it with absent-mindedness or incessant motion, but rather practice voluntary and intense thinking and learn how to stop our thoughts from issuing forth."
