  "title": "How do unrealistic expectations and negative language affect a trader's success in financial markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author elaborates on the source of discomfort that arises from unfulfilled expectations in trading. This can be attributed to a trader's preconceived notions about the market and their own trading activity. Such expectations can create hardships and sources of gratification during the trading process. However, when external circumstances like an economic crisis arise, these expectations cannot be overcome through logic alone. The author argues that different premises and approaches may need to be employed. The discussion is focused on the behavior of traders, and the factors that contribute to their success or failure in the market.",
  "content": "It might for instance occur that, on account of a far-reaching economic crisis, our capital has been substantially eaten into. In this case, the inconveniences which emerge cannot be overcome by recourse to logic or the conscious mind. They might rather require the use of different premises from those we have employed so far. How is it, however, that these expectations concerning which we feel discomfort are born? The answer to the question is: They are born out of experience. Let us assume that a particular trader has set up his own reality regarding the financial markets, and is going to erect his subjective convictions upon the supporting foundations of such a reality. This trader will then begin to construct for himself a set of expectations about his trading activity. That phenomenon, indeed, will be even more pronounced in respect of any separate purchase and sale transaction. He will accordingly seek to actualize his objectives through his own mode of conduct, with a view to reaching a state of fulfilling satisfaction. During this process which he has opted to go through, both hardships and sources of gratification will never fail to materialize.",
  "last_phrase": "To avoid the trap of repeating failed experiences, it's crucial to be aware that our expectations are often shaped by our past experiences. During challenging times, we may need to adjust our perspectives and explore new premises to achieve fulfillment. By being mindful of this phenomenon, we can approach future transactions with a more informed and adaptable mindset."
