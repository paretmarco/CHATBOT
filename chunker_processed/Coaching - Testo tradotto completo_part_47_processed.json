  "title": "\"Why do we struggle with multiple 'selves' that hinder our progress towards long-term goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the concept of \"self\" and how our egotistic self can lead to a lack of direction and purpose in life. The author also highlights the relationship between our essential inward being and the self, and how the two can become disconnected, causing problems in our lives. In the final 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the idea of the self and its tendency to take firm roots and lose touch with our more global individualized essence. The author warns of the dangers of being ruled by contingencies and ostensible needs and highlights the struggles that can arise from this disconnection. The text emphasizes the importance of maintaining a connection between our essential being and the self in order to live a purposeful and fulfilling life.",
  "content": "Normally, in fact, that is exactly how such a self is born: In the child, the self is born as a defence system on the strength of which he can journey across the sea of life and cultivate the illusion of having a few certainties. Subsequently to such an initial stage, however, that self has a tendency to take firm roots, forget the reason why it was originated into existence in the first place, and lose connection with the more global individualized essence of a human being, the inward being of the person. Whereas our essential inward being constantly remains the same, the external reality changes all the time. When the relationship that prevails between the intimate essential being and the self is broken, that is, when the external self is no longer in touch with the internal being, the external self will be merely ruled by the single moment, by contingencies, by ostensible needs. Problems might accordingly arise. Several men, although they are indefatigable workers, do not succeed in anything they do, because they shift this way or that way, and their present activity bears hardly any resemblance with the one they engaged in yesterday or will engage in tomorrow.",
  "last_phrase": "To avoid self-dispersion and lack of direction in life, it's essential to maintain a connection with our inward being. Though the external self may change with the passing of time, it's important to stay grounded in the central point of harmony that guides us towards our goals. With a conscious effort towards harmony and self-awareness, we can attain success and fulfillment in our pursuits."
