  "title": "\"What is Quantum Psychology and How Does it Relate to the Body's Survival Mechanism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the focus was on the concept of dismantling images in Quantum Psychology to access a deeper level of body awareness. Now, the discussion shifts towards how integrating this awareness is key to igniting the realization of biological spirituality, particularly the spinal connection up to the cerebral cortex, as formulated by Quantum Psychology principle. This perspective is supported by the idea created by psychologist Ida Rolf, who saw the core as bipolar and breakages in the balance create \"psychology\", a concept explained both by the Reichian therapy perspective and by the natural neurological process of creating structure from chaos. Korzybski's structural differential represents this abstracting process of the nervous system. The following 200 tokens detail further the integration of this awareness and its implications.",
  "content": "It should be noted that after conception the first part of the body formed is the bi-polar (i.e., electromagnetic) spine or core. Let us look at this statement from both a Quantum Psychology and also from a Reichian therapy perspective. Ida Rolf was saying that alignment on a biological level takes place when this core is aligned with 142 Chapter VIII the gravitational pull of the earth and sun. Quantum Psychology would say that breakages in the gravitational alignment in the core causes psychological structures to emerge (thoughts, beliefs, etc.) to compensate or explain for this breakage or interruption. In short, \"your\" individual separate \"I\" is a creation of the nervous system. Moshe Feldenkrais once said that \"the purpose of the nervous system is to organize chaos.\" In this way, it can be said that this natural neurological process creates psychology to order the chaos. Korzybski's structural differential is a pictorial representation of what he calls the nervous system's abstracting process. This is a process whereby the nervous system, as part of this natural neurological order, describes, labels, and makes inferences from the non-verbal.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the natural neurological process of how the body creates psychology as a survival mechanism and defense against over or under stimulation can help shed light on why changing identities may not happen rapidly. By aligning the bi-polar spine with the gravitational pull of the earth and sun and recognizing the nervous system's abstracting process, we can begin to better understand and organize the chaos within ourselves."
