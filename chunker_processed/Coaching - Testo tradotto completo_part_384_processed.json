  "title": "\"How can lack of self-confidence impact your will to power and influence others?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the importance of having a powerful inward state and resolute mindset to deploy one's will to power is emphasized. Lack of self-confidence curbs the will to power and the ability to influence others. The eyes are the windows to the mind and a feeble will is reflected in them. Unlimited trust and confidence in one's ability to achieve are necessary for success. Remembering these concepts will allow one to tap into their full reservoir of power to achieve their goals.",
  "content": "You might do no more than nurturing an inner desire to influence them, but the said lack of confidence in your ability will act as a barrier against the free action by your will, and you will largely end up accomplishing no result at all. That is so on account of the fact that, whenever will is not robust, suggestion cannot be carried out well, and your eyes will be denied the chance of taking on the intended expression. You should remember that the eyes are the windows onto one's mind or even onto his soul, and that a feeble will is going to confer on the eyes a radically different expression from the one which is gifted to them by a robustly vigorous will. Further remind yourselves of the fact that, if you want to be as far-reaching an achiever as you would like, you are enjoined to have an unlimited trust and an undiluted confidence in your own ability to ultimately achieve some special result indeed. This faith in yourselves, this certitude about your impending success, will empower you to avail yourselves of the full reservoir of power you happen to possess, in order for you to thereby accomplish the goal you have set out to actualize in your life.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to influence others effectively and achieve your goals, you must cultivate a strong and robust willpower. Merely desiring or lacking confidence in yourself will only serve as obstacles to your success. Remember that your eyes are the windows to your soul, and a feeble willpower will reflect in your expression. With unlimited trust and undiluted confidence in yourself, you can tap into your full reservoir of power and achieve extraordinary results. May you become a master of your own will and wield this miraculous force to enrich your life and the lives of those around you."
