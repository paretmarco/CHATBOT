  "title": "\"What is the Secret to Achieving Success through Personal Fulfilment and Positive Exploitation?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding part of this text, the author emphasizes that personal success is achieved by bettering and practicing the natural talents that we possess. He compares our being to a tree, where our deep individualized being is rooted in the ground, which is a metaphor for the Universe. To achieve our loftiest goals on an enduring basis, we must find inner satisfaction, and adapt our personality to the environment. The author also notes that the most successful people in history credit nature for their gifts, in addition to an irresistible tendency towards their work.",
  "content": "The ground might be a metaphor to describe the Universe, which our essential being must be in relation with, and with which it must be in a state of mutual harmony. Besides, due to the fact that a certain method of cultivating the soil might be more apposite than another, we must be able to adapt our personality to the surrounding environment. Inner satisfaction is the only condition which might confer continuity on what you are busy doing. It is only inside you that you might find the strength enabling you to attain the loftiest goals on an enduring basis. Had the chance been granted to interview the greatest leaders, the most famous artists, the most renowned philosophers, the discoverers, the saints, in short, the heroes, and they had been solicited in the course thereof to lay bare the secret behind their success, they would have undoubtedly replied that nature had made them what they were. At best, they would have added, by way of supplying an explanation, that theirs was an irresistible tendency, such that they had actually experienced no self-straining or sacrifice, or at least that they had gladly endured it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, finding and nurturing a creative principle within ourselves is essential for achieving lasting success and fulfilling relationships. Just as different methods of cultivating the soil are more appropriate for different environments, we must adapt our personalities to the world around us in order to achieve harmony. By staying in touch with our inner selves, we can discover our individual tendencies, set forth on a path towards fulfilling our ideals, and achieve our goals in a natural and meaningful way."
