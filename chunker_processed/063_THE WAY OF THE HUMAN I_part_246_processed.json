  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we see a clear definition of spirituality in Quantum Psychology. It is the realization that everything is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and the only true \"spiritual\" experience is non-verbal pure awareness. Any experience dissociated from other dimensions of awareness is a distortion of reality and not grounded in the whole. These ideas are intricately linked to the concept of the biological core, which when repaired through yoga, allows for a natural and non-trance state of being.",
  "content": "151 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The only real \"spiritual\" experience is the no-experience experience, the non-verbal \"I AM\" or the pure awareness of the NOT-I-I of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE . QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Any experience that is dissociated from the other dimensions of awareness is not grounded in the whole. Therefore, it can lead to a distortion of reality and not THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. This is why so many mediators have \"spiritual\" ideas about spirituality. In Quantum Psychology, your idea of spirituality is not spirituality. Spirituality is a no-experience experience. It has neither meaning nor purpose. not appreciating this is why the changeless background of \"spirituality\" goes unnoticed. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Any idea you have about spirituality is not spirituality. Spirituality has no ideas. It is not even the idea of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. BIOLOGICAL CORE YOGA A body yoga or a core yoga is a natural yoga. Once the breakages in Awareness and splitting off end, there is a no more trancingout (see Trances People Live or The Dark Side of the Inner Child).",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Quantum Psychology emphasizes the importance of developing multi-dimensional awareness and understanding that true spirituality is a no-experience experience. Biological Core Yoga is a natural yoga that can help achieve a state of daily awareness with no self, no internal dialogue and no emotional interruptions. By practicing these principles, one can attain a profound level of mindfulness and inner peace."
