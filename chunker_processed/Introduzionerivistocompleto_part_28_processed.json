  "title": "\"What is the enneagram tool and how can it be used for personal and professional growth?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the enneagram, a tool that describes nine different personality profiles in which we can all recognize ourselves. Knowing different types is helpful to understand our own psychology and establish an instant rapport with others. The last section focuses on types five to eight, including their key motivations and representational channels. Developed type 5 is multi-knowledged and represents through auditory coenaesthesis. Developed type 6 is loyal and represents through visual coenaesthesis, while developed type 7 is the eternal child and represents through visual coenaesthesis. Developed type 8 is combatitive and protective, representing through the kinesthetic system.",
  "content": "They support lost causes and always put themselves in second place. The phobic type six are insecure; they feel persecuted and give in if they feel their backs are against the wall. The contra-phobic feel as if they constantly have their backs against the wall and react to fear with aggression. Developed type six are excellent team players, loyal soldiers and friends. They dedicate themselves to a cause in the same way others do for personal profit. Their representational channel is AUDITORY VISUAL. They have a fear of being cheated by human matters! Key Motivation: skepticism 7. THE ENTHUSIAST They are pleasure seekers, like the eternal child who approaches life in an amateurish way. They tend to go for brief relationships, superficiality, adventure and hedonism. They seldom make an effort; they want to keep all options open. Their main feature is that they are always in a good mood, generally happy and are good company. They start things but do not finish them. Developed type seven are excellent theorists, are very succinct and embody the “renaissance” man. They live very much in the present, in fact, they believe in the motto “carpe diem”. Their representational channel is VISUAL COENEASTHESIS. Key Motivation ACT and LIVE! 8. THE CHALLENGER They believe fundamentally in struggle, therefore, lawyers come under type eight. Their motto is “dominate or be dominated”, being very protective, attacking to defend themselves and their friends. Being combatitive, openly showing anger and strength, they have a great respect for opponents who confront them sincerely.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Enneagram is a valuable tool for personal and professional development, offering insight into our own tendencies and helping us relate better to others. Hypnosis, as a communication model, can be used to induce relaxation and transformation. By understanding and using these tools, we can become more self-aware, productive, and fulfilled individuals. Remember, life is what we make of it, so let's embrace our passions, challenge ourselves, and live each moment to the fullest."
