  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the article discussed the importance of setting clear goals and avoiding impulsive decisions in trading. In the last 200 tokens, the article explores the psychological factors that can affect a trader's performance. The concept of \"dissociation\" is introduced, where traders become hyper-analytical and mentally disengage from reality. Another issue discussed is the tendency for traders to distort reality and not admit to ineffective strategies. The article also mentions the five most common emotional reactions that traders experience and how they can lead to \"waves\" in the market. An expert trader knows how to ride these waves, but those lacking emotional self-awareness may end up being swept away.",
  "content": "They live as if they were attached to the study department of a large bank. Keep in mind, however, that in this field money reaches you from what you do, and not from what you think! The traders’ sensory distortions Many traders do not want to admit that they are deploying an ineffective strategy. They thus mentally distort the existing situation. In this case, the first step to being cured is to become conscious of where we are. The best method for solving this type of “distortion” of reality is to keep a graph of one’s own progress (or regression). By comparing it with the actual graph of the market, in fact, we might develop useful ideas and understand ourselves better. The five most common emotional reactions In the markets, emotional reactions on the part of the single operators might add up to each other so as to give birth to fully-fledged “waves”. An expert trader knows how to decipher and ride these waves. As for a trader lacking presence to his own self, he might end up being swept away and sucked up by them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, trading is not just about following a strategy and crunching numbers; it also involves managing emotions and avoiding common pitfalls that can hinder success. By becoming conscious of our own emotional reactions and keeping track of our progress, we can overcome sensory distortions and ride the waves of the market to achieve our trading goals. Remember, in this field, money comes from what you do, not from what you think!"
