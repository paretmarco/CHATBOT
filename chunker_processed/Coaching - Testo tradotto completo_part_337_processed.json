  "title": "\"How can we use imagination as a tool to define and achieve our goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding part of this text, the idea of constructing a building served as an analogy for focusing on the present purpose of one's actions rather than a fixed idea. Now, we delve deeper into the concept of visualization and how it can help us achieve our goals. Self-study is essential in determining what we want and the type of imagination we need to create. This imagination can steer the mind and universe in a particular direction, allowing us to create situations we desire. We must start with a clear idea and mould it to our liking, just as painting up a canvas.",
  "content": "This key enables the conferment of a specific direction on the present within the physical realm, and allows us to create the situations we desire. This type of imagination is one of the forms taken by a higher art which steers the mind and the universe towards a particular direction. It is an imagination that must always start from your own selves. You must therefore study yourselves, your needs, your defects, and on that basis determine the true objectives of your life and your character. No one can know which one is the route to follow, unless he is first familiar with the point he is going to set out from. Painting up the canvas For us to be able to create, we have to start from an idea. We have, in other words, to define what we intend achieving 72. Here under, we are going to conduct a fully-fledged examination of this issue. The issue is also definable by the concept of “moulding the pristine idea”, as well as by the metaphor of painting up the bare canvas to which colour is later going to be added. We can gift ourselves a quality we are lacking, or remove from us a defect which harms us.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, shaping our thoughts and desires into a clear and defined goal is essential to bring into existence the situations we desire. This process of painting up the canvas of our mind requires a deep self-understanding and a constant pursuit of improvement, in harmony with the universe. Embodying our goals with sensory and emotional color, we activate our whole brain and fuse our desires with our identity, creating a dynamic and vibrant image of our ideal selves."
