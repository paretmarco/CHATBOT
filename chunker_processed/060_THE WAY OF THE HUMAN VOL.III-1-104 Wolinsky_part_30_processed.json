He explains how he feels a sense of aloneness and tries to get rid of it, resulting in two separate identities. Wolinsky delves into where Bill feels these emotions in his body and explores their origins, highlighting the impact of his parents. This extract provides insight into the deep-rooted pain that drives our behaviors and emotions.",
  "content": "Bill:I have the False Core experience of alone, and then me trying to get rid of it. So there are two identities. Most of my energy has been dumped into destroying that sense of aloneness or merging so I don't have to experience that sense of alone. Wolinsky:Where in your body do you experience the alone? Bill:It's that kind of gaping wound, that gaping hole in the core of my torso. Wolinsky:Where in your body do you experience this trying to connect (False Self Compensator) and get rid of the alone (False Core Driver)? Bill:It's kind of an energy that comes out of the torso. Wolinsky:Does the energy come out around the False Core, or does the energy come out of the gaping wound? Bill:It's around the gaping wound. 21 he Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Therapeutic Note Notice how visceral the narcissistic wound is. Wolinsky:Who modeled this alone for you?
