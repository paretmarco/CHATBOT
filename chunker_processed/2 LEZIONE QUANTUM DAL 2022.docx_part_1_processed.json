  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, we discussed the importance of education and its outcome on the individual and society. Now, we'll dive into the topic of humanities and social sciences with a focus on the works of Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault. In this last 200 tokens, we'll explore how Chomsky's language theory and Foucault's ideas on power relations intersect and influence each other. We'll also discuss how these theoretical frameworks can offer insights into social issues and institutions.",

Practicing exercises with a mirror and learning to maintain eye contact with clients can lead to improved communication and successful interactions. Additionally, working on personal growth through techniques like the ones demonstrated in this lesson can lead to positive change and transformation. Remember to always approach interactions with curiosity and respect for the other person."
