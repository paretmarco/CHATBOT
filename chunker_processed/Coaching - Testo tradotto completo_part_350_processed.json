  "title": "How can one assimilate a moral quality into their being through visualization and absorption?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the process of envisioning and assimilating desired qualities. The previous section discusses how to spiritually envision and project your desired qualities onto your physical form. This last part focuses on the phase of absorption in which one drinks a liquid blessed by their thoughts and holds the belief that their thoughts and ideals will be absorbed and circulated within them. The success of this process depends on its precise implementation, including both the material and spiritual aspects. By this stage, the reader should have already achieved an average level of self-hypnosis.",
  "content": "Think of the water you are drinking as having been enlivened via a descent and a gradual materialization of the spirit in the world, which is caused by the spirit assuming the shape of that perfection you have imagined to perceive on the surface of the water. Hold the cup which contains the liquid and drink it slowly, non-stop, accompanying such action by the idea that the vibrations cast into it by your thought shall all bounce back to you, for them to subsequently circulate within your being. In order to asseverate the successful execution of the operation, you ought to feel yourselves, at the end of it, being in a state of happy calm, as if the discharge of the vow expressed by yourselves through the formula had already taken place at that precise moment. Our advice to the disciple is to study this paragraph well, and to assess every part thereof as it should. Success depends on its precise implementation, not only the material side of it, but also the spiritual component of its application. The level you have attained by this stage, provided you have worked well, is already the level attained through an average self-hypnosis.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the method described and by treating the act of drinking water with intention and mindfulness, you can create a powerful and positive shift in your being, both physically and spiritually. Remember to carefully study and implement every step of the process for the best possible outcome, and allow yourself to experience the happy calm that comes with successful execution. With practice, you can access a new dimension where your idea merges with your body, forming a unified amalgam, and experience the benefits of materializing your intention."
