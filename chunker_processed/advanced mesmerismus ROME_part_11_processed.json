  "first_phrase": "This text explores the topic of non-verbal communication and the power it holds to influence others. The previous section covered the basics of non-verbal communication, including proxemics, paralinguistics, gaze, magnetic passes, and gestures. The last part of the text delves deeper into the topic, introducing the concept of non-verbal hypnotism, the closure of the senses technique, and the 10 plexuses technique. It also includes exercises aimed at discovering the power of proxemics and understanding basic principles, such as the magnetic circle and the magnetic ecstasy technique. Readers will learn how to heal pain in the spine and combat anxiety, as well as the benefits of inducing a state of ecstasy and how it can be used in therapy.",
  "content": "A circle will feel him as you are \"around\" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up Don't touch to much the person in thsi first exercise. ================================================ Q&A Can I do with a lying person? Yes you can do, but you must be very expert. In reality when a person is standing each time we see his/her reaction in the balance and how he she holds it. When a person is laying we can only guess ================================================ NOTE Different types of people Some people will react more, some people less. Sometimes we must REDUCE stimulations and we will have stronger reactions Notice how these stimulations are something you cannot oppose to How can you oppose yourself to a sound? We see for exemple that music can work even on very rational people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, non-verbal hypnosis can be a powerful tool for therapeutic interventions, but it requires expertise and sensitivity to individual differences. It involves a combination of approaches, including symbolic and accompanying, proxemics, touch, and sound, to elicit emotional responses and facilitate a state of trance. Understanding the neurological and psychological interpretations of the work on the two sides of the individual, as well as the use of feedback loops and testing, can enhance the effectiveness of non-verbal hypnosis. Finally, the use of fluidification and magnetism can further enhance the client's receptivity to hypnosis and achieve balancing and healing effects."
