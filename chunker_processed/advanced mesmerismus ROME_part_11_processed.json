Yes you can do, but you must be very expert. In reality when a person is standing each time we see his/her reaction in the balance and how he she holds it. When a person is laying we can only guess ================================================ NOTE Different types of people Some people will react more, some people less. Sometimes we must REDUCE stimulations and we will have stronger reactions Notice how these stimulations are something you cannot oppose to How can you oppose yourself to a sound? We see for exemple that music can work even on very rational people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, non-verbal hypnosis is a powerful tool that involves using body language, sounds, and movement to help clients achieve a heightened state of awareness and sensitivity. By understanding the different types of people and their reactions to stimuli, you can use a variety of techniques such as magnetic passes and catalepsy to induce a state of trance. Remember to be patient and attentive to the client's reactions, and use a mix of symbolic and accompanying non-verbal hypnosis styles. With practice, this technique can help you improve your therapeutic outcomes and facilitate deeper emotional connections with your clients."
