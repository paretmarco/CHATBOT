The importance of meditating on oneself before any thoughts about God is also highlighted. The last 200 tokens are part of an exercise that aims to guide individuals towards the realization of the I AM state. The exercise involves asking questions without relying on thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions. It helps to go beyond the observer-observed dyad and into the I AM state.",
