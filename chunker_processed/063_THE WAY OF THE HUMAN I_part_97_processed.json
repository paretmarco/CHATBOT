  "title": "\"What is the Danger of Diagnosis in Psycho-spiritual Practices?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text highlights the issues with psycho-spirituality becoming teacher-centered instead of student-centered. The author notes that many teachers give the same mantras or practices to all their students, rather than tailoring them to individual needs. Additionally, teachers may not refer students elsewhere, even if it is in the student's best interest. The author uses an example of their time with Nisargadatta Maharaj, who kicked students out when it was not right for them to stay and who tailored his teachings to the individual. The author argues that psycho-spiritual practices should be client/student-centered and that teachers should be aware of the limitations of their systems and refer out when necessary. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains how Nisargadatta Maharaj's approach to teaching was student-centered and used an individualized approach based on each person's needs.",
  "content": "\"I fantasized\" two reasons for this: (1) \"He\" somehow knew it was not right for them. Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, \"It is not for everybody\"; and (2) \"I imagine\" when \"he\" felt you got ________________ Chapter II what you needed, he asked you to leave. Many times I heard him say, \"I am not here to accumulate students.\" Once a woman traveled all the way from Europe. Nisargadatta Maharaj asked her, \"How long are you staying?\" She said, \"Three months.\" \"No, stay for a week or so until you understand it. If you stay too long, you will just listen to me and not do the work.\" This was the mark of a \"teacher\" who was student-centered, not self-centered. Everybody needs something different, something tailor-made just for them. Psychological and spiritual practices should be tailored to the individual. They should be student or client centered, not teacher centered. And teachers of each system should acknowledge the system's limitations and when called for, refer out.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial for psychological and spiritual practices to be tailored to the individual, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Teachers should prioritize their students' needs over their own, and acknowledge the limitations of their system. We must avoid the danger of diagnosis and remember that each person is unique and cannot be fully understood through a label or classification."
