  "title": "\"How can we focus our mental energy and access intuition to create a life plan?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the importance of focusing on the mental side and simplifying thought was discussed. Now, in the last part of the text, the focus shifts to defining the ambit of our positive activity by accessing our intuition. This system links predetermination to free human choice through readying the conditions for a desired mental state. Focusing one's energies is the first foundational layer for creating things in reality, and opportunities may arise when we gather energy in the present moment. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of practicing the method attentively to seize those opportunities.",
  "content": "Having thus cleared the ground on which we wish to erect our building of any obstructing element which might cause us to slip, it is now a case of getting down to work. It is, in other words, a case of defining in advance, through a series of plans, the ambit of our positive activity. For us to do that, we shall resort to our intuition. Accessing one’s own intuition 2) Part Two: Understanding time, and being in possession of mental clarity It should be noted that this system links predetermination to free human choice. The two elements, in fact, are not mutually exclusive but rather synergic. Predetermination can be seen as the art of readying the conditions by which a desired mental state becomes possible. We engage in our creative work within a space in which we channel mental energies towards a purpose without needing to think about tomorrow. Focusing one’s energies is the first foundational layer for the process of creating things within reality. At that moment, by gathering energies in the now, opportunities might arise, which you will be equally capable of seizing provided you have attentively practice the method.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, accessing our intuition and understanding time’s two dimensions, planning and opportunities, are crucial for creating within reality. By defining our positive activity through plans and channeling our mental energies towards a purpose, we can simultaneously live in projected time and real time. Remember, our life plan is already within us, and it requires attentively practicing the method rather than relying on fixed and immutable recipes."
