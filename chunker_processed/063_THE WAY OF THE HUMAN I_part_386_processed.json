  "title": "\"What is the Next Developmental Phase and the New Age Complex?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section explores the developmental phase of practicing, from 10 to 16 months, characterized by grandiosity and independence. It then draws parallels between seminar leaders who preach \"you can have anything you want\" and individuals stuck in this phase, who believe they can create their reality. Such beliefs are deemed grandiose or even psychopathic by the author, who argues that while our thoughts and beliefs may influence our subjective experience, they do not control external reality. This serves as a cautionary tale for those who underestimate the complexity of the world and overestimate their own power in it.",
  "content": "They imagine that they are the center of the universe and that their beliefs or thoughts create their external world. In order to be clear, your beliefs do help to create your internal subjective experience. They do not create or control the external world or how or what the external world thinks of you. If a New-Ager is walking down the street and someone yells out, \"Asshole,\" they might say to themselves, \"I wonder why I created that\" or \"I wander if there are lessons to learn.\" This is both grandiose—i.e., \"I create their actions\"—and an age-regressed spiritual reframe—i.e., learning lessons, or some higher power (Mom/ Dad, school, etc.) is teaching me for some divine growth reason. Quantum Psychology would say that,you are not responsible for the person yelling out \"asshole.\" But you are responsible for what you internally, subjectively create in response to their remark such as \"Who cares,\" or \"I'm going to kill them,'\" or \"I feel hurt.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that while our beliefs do shape our internal experience, they do not control or create the external world. The New Age Complex is a trance that can obscure this reality, leading individuals to believe in their own grandiosity. By understanding this dynamic, we can more effectively address our own responses to external stimuli and cultivate a healthier relationship with the world around us."
