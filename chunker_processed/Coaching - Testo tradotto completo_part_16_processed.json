  "title": "How can we use synchronicity and being present to guide our actions and have the Universe help us?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section of the text, the focus is on taking action and guiding the Universe to help us achieve our goals. It emphasizes the importance of being present and intuitive in order to discern the direction we should be moving towards. Once we have clarity on our direction, we need to consciously act in harmony with our essential being, and organize our activity towards our goal. By doing so, we may attract the necessary elements to aid us along the way. The exercises presented are newly-minted and intended to help us achieve this new way of being.",
  "content": "It is to know how to act, and on that basis organize our activity in such a manner that the ultimate goal we offer ourselves will draw near us naturally, as opposed to leaving our action in the grip of the whims of psychological automatism and our habit-loving subconscious. It is essential that it is not just our little ego that should act. It is our essential inward being that must act, and make sure that each one of our thoughts, words and acts, lead us to such a goal, or at least does not distance us from it, in a natural fashion. FOURTH POINT â€“ Guiding the Universe to Assist us At that point, a new way of being has been originated into existence. This new way of being consists in being in a state of harmony with our essential being and in developing ourselves within the Universe. Thereupon, things might be attracted instead of being chased after. We might go beyond the element of time itself, and realize ourselves even before the deadline we had originally set for ourselves. It is only a few elements which are encompassed by this method that are already known. The exercises we are going to present are in the main newly-minted.",
  "last_phrase": "By following these four points and aligning ourselves with our essential inward being, we open ourselves up to a new way of being in harmony with the Universe. This allows us to attract our desired goal naturally, without being controlled by our habits or ego. With these exercises and methods, we can realize ourselves even before the deadline we had originally set. So let's take action and guide the Universe to assist us in achieving our goals effortlessly."
