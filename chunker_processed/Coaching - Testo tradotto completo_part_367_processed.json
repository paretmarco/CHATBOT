  "title": "What is the accelerated or modern way in manifestation, and how can it lead to solutions beyond linear thinking?",
  "first_phrase": "In this portion of the text, the author describes an accelerated version of a method that was previously discussed. The method involves using light as an aid to achieve an \"accumulation of thought\" and tapping into our quantum mind to find solutions. The process is done by first thinking about what we desire, then staring at the light for thirty seconds, closing our eyes and observing the luminous trace, and finally identifying any replies that may come to our beings. The author emphasizes the importance of staying present and notes that it is our global being rather than our circumscribed reason that discovers the solution.",
  "content": "Once this trace will have vanished completely, we shall reopen our eyes and identify a reply, assuming there is going to be any. You should take care to write down, or in any other way keep note of, whichever thing might come to your beings. Thereafter, if you so wish, you will repeat the procedure. There are times when solutions surface to your attention at once, in order for them to be subsequently followed by yet another set of even more valid solutions. According to the modern quantum conception, both these paths, the classical and the accelerated / modern ones, address our “total” or “quantum” mind, and kick-start a reasoning which is other than linear, as it rather unfolds itself in a different manner, one which works on the whole rather than on the separate parts. Remind yourselves to stay in the present, in the now, at the time when you observe the residual image. It is in the now, indeed, that re-integration might find its actualization. By proceeding in the said fashion, it will not be the conscious mind, i.e. our circumscribed reason 89, which discovers the solution, but rather our own global being.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you wish to unlock solutions beyond your conscious mind, stay in the present and repeat the process of observing residual images to access the world of universal beings. Once you have defined what you want, use the \"law of attraction\" to create a new reality in the physical world. Remember to keep track of any insights that come to you and repeat the process as needed to find solutions that align with your true self."
