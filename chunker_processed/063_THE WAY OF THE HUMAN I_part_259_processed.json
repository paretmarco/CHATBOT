  "title": "What is the context of our animal nature in psychology and spirituality?",
  "first_phrase": "This part explores the idea of how psychology and spirituality often forget or misunderstand the biological context of our animal nature. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging that our psychology and emotional processes are fueled by a larger biological context. The author also mentions the concept of \"biological spirituality,\" which is experiencing the body as grounded and made of the same substance. In the earlier part of the text, the author highlights how repression of our biological needs leads to the substitution of socially acceptable expressions.",
  "content": "Psychology oftentimes splits the person off, taking them out of the animal context of their biology and creating a false context \"as if psychology were not a part of biology, thus causing their thinking process to become dissociated from their biology. In this way social rules (external) become the context rather than the animal and biological nature which we are all organized around, i.e., I have to hold in my shit until a certain time, and eyen if I'm hungry I can only eat at dinnertime. Psychology tries to gain control over the animal but it can't be done, and this makes us feel even more chaotic and split-off from \"ourselves\" and \"others.\" This is why Nisargadatta Maharaj did not say \"mind and body\" or \"mind body,\" but rather \"body-mind.\" BIOLOGICAL SPIRITUALITY Through biological deprivation, trauma and the dissociation or splitting off that occurs from the pain story of that narcissistic injury (see Volume II), you get psychology. When psychology is aberrated and dissociated, you get a high percentage of what people call \"spirituality.\" Biological spirituality is experiencing the body as grounded and being made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to remember that psychology is a part of biology, and any attempt to separate the two can lead to feelings of dissociation and chaos. Understanding the unity of body, mind, and spirit can help us achieve a sense of biological spirituality and overcome fear."
