  "title": "\"How can therapists and spiritual teachers adopt a multi-dimensional approach to help their clients?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, it was explained that no single system handles every client or problem, and therapists or \"teachers\" must be willing to refer them to an appropriate person. The ancient Sufi tradition demonstrated this by sending individuals to different teachers to get the help they needed. However, nowadays, people often receive the same techniques in a \"one size fits all\" approach. The Way of the Human is to see the body-mind-spirit as one and handle the problem at the level of the problem. The upcoming demonstration highlights the impact of the thinking dimension and the importance of letting go of thoughts to see experiences as they are.",
  "content": "This \"one size fits all\" is a guru- or technique-centered approach. The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: A therapist or \"teacher\" should not be there to get their needs met in a workshop training room or therapy room. To summarize, the body-mind-spirit are one and yet all holographic; all the same but with different functions. Meet the problem at the level of the problem. This is the Way of the Human. The Quantum approach asks of us to BE just that, a human, which is already the Quantum whole. One who practices the Way of the Human is asked to not compartmentalize body, mind and spirit, but to see them as different densities of THAT ONE SAME SUBSTANCE. With this in mind, let us look at the following demonstration: DEMONSTRATION In this demonstration we go through the dimensions, noticing the impact of the thinking dimension. This is an extremely important exercise because your thoughts about what is happening give it meaning which is not what is happening. When you let go of your thoughts, ideas, and meaning placed upon experiences, resistance leaves and you can have what is as it is.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Way of the Human and Quantum Psychology principles emphasize the importance of multi-dimensional awareness and treating the body-mind-spirit as one holographic entity. The exercise of going through dimensions and letting go of thoughts can help in reducing resistance and experiencing reality as it is. Remember, a guru-centered approach is not effective, and the focus should be on meeting the problem at the level of the problem."
