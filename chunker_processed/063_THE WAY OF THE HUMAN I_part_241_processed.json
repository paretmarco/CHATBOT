  "title": "What is the BIOLOGICAL CORE and why is it important in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, we delve deeper into Rolf's philosophy of Quantum Psychology, which emphasizes the importance of being in touch with our biological core for experiencing personal aliveness and genuine connection with the external world. We learn how trauma can freeze our experience of separation, preventing the natural pulsating process of merger and separation in our biology. By being aware of our biological core, we can align our thinking and feeling dimensions and attain pure being. The non-verbal \"I am\" and functional movement become instinctual, leading us to embody the Tao.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater your connection to your BIOLOGICAL CORE, and the natural alignment of the gravitational pull of the sun and the earth, the greater your connection to the external world as one solid unity. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater your connection to the BIOLOGICAL CORE, the greater will be the probability that \"you\" might experience unity or experience the body as made of the same substance as everything else. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The more you are aware of the BIOLOGICAL CORE, the more making decisions becomes a nonissue, life becomes a nonissue and your psychology becomes a non-issue, you just are, things just occur. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The BIOLOGICAL CORE is the vehicle for the thinking and feeling dimensions. When they are aligned, there is pure being at a biological level: The NON-VERBAL I AM. Simply put, doing, or walking in your being occur. The being naturally becomes functional in its movement. That is the Tao, and what it means to be in your BIOLOGICAL CORE. In this way, the BIOLOGICAL CORE is what you cannot live fully without.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, working towards connecting with your Biological Core through a Quantum Psychology approach can provide a deeper sense of unity and integration with the external world. By aligning with the gravitational forces of the sun and earth, and acknowledging the importance of the Biological Core as the vehicle for both thinking and feeling dimensions, we can achieve a state of pure being at a biological level, where decisions and psychology become non-issues and we can simply be. This understanding can lead to a more cohesive and balanced experience of life, resulting in fewer energetic interruptions and more connection with the underlying unity that moves through all things."
