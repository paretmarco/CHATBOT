  "title": "\"What are the limitations of the 'You can have anything you want' philosophy in the New Age movement?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the New Age belief that one can have or create anything they want, which promotes grandiosity and denies the reality of limitation. Althea Homer's stance on this defensive attitude is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and working with one's limitations. The last 200 tokens detail two types of spiritual trances that reinforce the infantile notion of dependent unity with the mother. The Way of the Human encourages individuals to acknowledge all dimensions of their humanness, including limitations.",
  "content": "They often say, \"Don't come from scarcity.\" Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of gold, silver, oil, diamonds, etc. on the planet. This is a fact. For that reason, if some people have billions, many won't have anything. Furthermore, you cannot have all you want; you can have what you want given your IQ, genetics, natural abilities, looks, inheritance, external context, luck, etc. The Way of the Human at this level requires that you be honest with yourself and acknowledge and work with your limitations, rather than indulge your imagined grandiosity. SPIRITUAL TRANCES 1. I Am One with the Mother. In India, people are frequently disciples of the Mother. Notice how this can be a re-enactment of the symbiotic relationship the child has with their mother. 2. I Am One. Here, differentiation at one level is incomplete, which means that the person feels no separation and in life fuses with everything and everyone. The Way of the Human asks us to acknowledge all the dimensions of our humanness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that there are limitations in life, including in resources and personal abilities. Instead of focusing on imagined grandiosity, we must be honest with ourselves and work within our limitations. This includes acknowledging all dimensions of our humanness and not prematurely regressing in our developmental journey. By doing so, we can stabilize our true human nature and achieve freedom at all levels of awareness."
