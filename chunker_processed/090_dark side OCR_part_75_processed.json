  "title": "How do our inner child's trances affect our reality and decision-making process?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the power of creating intentional experiences and awakening the observer's creative aspect. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces three different trances, starting with \"Planning,\" which is a form of futurizing that occurs when a child cannot express their feelings to their parents, and they imagine a future confrontation where they get validation. The author also describes a \"winning by losing\" trance where revenge is the goal, and then introduces \"The Explainer,\" where individuals simulate conversations in their heads to explain or justify situations to other people.",
  "content": "He built a case, in a lecture I attended, showing how he was good and Dad was bad. What was extraordinary was that, at the end of the story, Dad admits he was wrong and the son was right, and the audience exploded in applause. Why? Many people hold this trance. Another style of planning takes place when a child cannot tell his parents how he feels so he plans ways to spite or get even with his parents in the future. This is a \"winning by losing\" trance, and here I often ask clients to fill in the blanks: 1. I spite you by. 2. I get even with you by. 3. I win by losing by 4. show you. I won't 5. show you. I will These questions make the implicit explicit and reveal this classic masochistic trance of the dark side of the inner child. 4. The Explainer I call this trance \"play it again, Sam,\" because a friend of mine planned conversations, explanations, or justifications in the future with people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to be aware of the different trances of the inner child, such as the \"winning by losing\" trance or the \"play it again, Sam\" trance, and to identify them in order to break free from their negative patterns. By exploring these implicit trances, we can understand the motivations behind our behavior and start to heal past wounds, enabling us to move forward with greater resilience and emotional well-being."
