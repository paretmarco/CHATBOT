  "first_phrase": "The text discusses the concept of \"ESSENCE\" and how it is perceived by the \"False Core-False Self\" as empty space. The author emphasizes the idea that \"ESSENCE\" is full of \"Essential Qualities\" and that \"Energy\" interpenetrates and permeates both the child in the womb and the space of \"ESSENCE.\" Turning inside out means to notice the space inside your physical body around which your body is organized. The text concludes by highlighting the theory of Quantum Psychology that \"seekers\" are often looking for that \"one\" enlightenment touch to end their pain. The author encourages readers to consider the essential qualities of ESSENCE and to seek pure awareness, pure being, pure love, pure observation, or pure knowing.",
  "content": "This energy interpenetrates your ESSENCE which is why it so difficult to sit in ESSENCE unless you can begin to process through and get the ESSENCE of ESSENCE. By turning yourself inside out, you can get pure ESSENCE before any kind of penetration or interpenetration of energy from another occurs. Quantum Psychology defines pure as having no subject or object. Pure awareness, pure being, pure love, pure observation or pure knowing—these are all Essential qualities. TURNING INSIDE OUT Turning inside out means to notice that there is a space inside your physical body around which your body is organized.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of ESSENCE and turning oneself inside out can help to access pure awareness, which is free from any subject or object. By doing so, we can prevent the interpenetration of external energies and avoid the obsessive-compulsive wish for sudden enlightenment. It is essential to acknowledge that true enlightenment and freedom from pain come from within and require personal effort and practice."
