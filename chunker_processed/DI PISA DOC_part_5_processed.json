  "title": "\"What is Instant Fascination and How Did Prof. Erminio Di Pisa Use It to Heal?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a discussion of the remarkable abilities of Prof. Erminio di Pisa when it comes to hypnosis, healing, and diagnosis. He treated a range of medical conditions with exceptional success rates, and even provided instant regressions in under five seconds. He demonstrated amazing hypnosis skills even in public places like restaurants, and exhibited generosity toward others. His techniques were grounded in universal harmony and astrological studies, and he was a firm believer in the power of healing through hypnosis. In addition, his ability to provide mediumistic diagnoses was also noted, making him a unique and talented figure in the field of hypnosis.",
  "content": "In his work methodology, as was the case with the ancient people, he always strove to be in a state of balance with universal harmony, which he used to discern as a result of his astrological studies. He did also Instant Regressions (regressions based on fascination and with an induction lasting less than 5 seconds), i.e. bringing a person to his past. This also can be useful for healing purposes It is thus from him that we have learnt how to employ this art for healing purposes. Prof. Erminio, too, had been directly introduced to this discipline, in 1973, by another master: Prof. Caravelli. The latter was a masterful expert in the so-called art of “bi-location”, so much so that he could be simultaneously perceived in two different places. Di Pisa, too, practiced similar techniques. We note that in a quantum view of the world, location is a construction of the senses. At a quantum implicate level of reality, everything is connected. The key is going beyond sensing reality in the ordinary way. The exercise of Di Pisa used reflected light as an important tool. Prof. Di Pisa was also a fervent admirer of Donato, and he sometimes used the name “Prof. Donato”. We should mention, at this stage, some distinguishing features of his personality. He paid the closest attention to details and was extremely alert in every situation. He was truly present, capable as such of perceiving whatever was taking place. Because of that quality, he was gifted with a deep ability to give mediumistic diagnoses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the work methodology of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa was truly unique, combining his knowledge of astrology and instant regressions to heal physical and mental ailments through his practice of instant hypnosis. His ability to fascinate and hypnotize his clients was a key feature of his personality, and his use of the look-centred therapy allowed him to intervene in habitual mental mechanisms to cure patients. The scientific research on the power of memory and its potential to be rewritten further supports the efficacy of instant hypnosis. Overall, Erminio Di Pisa's legacy in the field of healing is truly remarkable and continues to inspire further study and exploration."
