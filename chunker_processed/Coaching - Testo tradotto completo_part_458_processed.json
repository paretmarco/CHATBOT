The author emphasizes the need to define your objective before trading, and to operate on two different levels: a linear level, where you pursue your goals, and a higher level, where you utilize intuitive acumen. This advice is given to those who engage in trading as a profession, not as a bet. The text also warns against getting \"hypnotized\" by media or masses and advises being pragmatic to operate effectively in the market.",
  "content": "The person who engages in trading is a person who works, and who is enjoined by that fact to derive a net profit from his activity. Advice 1: Learn to understand trading. Trading is a profession, not a bet! How to operate in the Markets In order to operate effectively, it is necessary that you should have an initial strategy and some tactics, i.e. that you should know how to carry out your actions in the short term. A good trader is pragmatic and operates on two different levels, which represent the equivalent of the two planes on which a house in built: 1. An underlying linear level, that is, a level of “cause and effect” where the trader shall give practical effect to a well defined series of actions founded upon some objectives to attain. The trader shall clearly delineate such objectives, and then, in his endeavour to pursue them, he will especially take care not to let himself become “hypnotized” by the behaviour of the masses or by the conduct promoted by the media. He will be utilizing linear time (chronos). 2. A higher level where he will gain access to his intuitive acumen.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, trading requires a strategic approach and knowledge of the markets, as well as the ability to tap into your intuitive acumen. A good trader balances their linear actions with their intuitive insights, and makes decisions based on a desire for self-fulfilment rather than solely for financial gain. With these principles in mind, you can navigate the markets confidently and effectively."
