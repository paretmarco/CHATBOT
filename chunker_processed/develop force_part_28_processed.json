  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the focus is on exercises to develop the \"Fascinative Force\" by awakening the intuition and increasing magnetism. The concept of the third eye is introduced, and its connection to the physiological location of the epiphysis and the pineal gland regulating manâ€™s day/night cycle is explained. The author suggests exercises to activate the entire lung capacity and explains how muscle tension can be used to increase energy and create brain coherence. The benefits of practicing these exercises are not only for physical health but to infuse the body and spirit with a magnetic energy that cannot be obtained in other ways.",
  "content": "There is no exercise able to force the air to get in each particle of the lungs, as the one described above. It will take you no more than one minute each morning to perform this exercise, and a few days will be enough to convince the student that the benefits obtained are great. Not only is of great benefit to health, but also infuses to both, body and spirit, a magnetic energy not obtainable in other way. The key of muscle tension Let us act now on the muscles. These are the fundamental keys to increase progressively the magnetism. The mind works on the muscular system, but the latter can act upon the mind too. Characteristic of the work done with muscles is the nervous effort. Nervous effort activates a series of reactions in mind as well as physical exertion increases muscle mass. This energy is released later, and can also be increased to higher levels with subsequent contractions. The kinds of tensions to create energy have a particularity: we tense simultaneously a muscle and his antagonist. Therefore, we do not have movement, but simple contraction. Some scholars have supposed that this type of muscle tension, to a psychological level corresponds to a \"not done action\". Whenever we do an exercise of this kind, we load a unit of energy. You can increase the tension up to vibrate. In addition, the vibration creates a pace that can ease, by resonance, the creation of brain coherence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by incorporating these simple exercises into your daily routine, you can enhance your physical and mental well-being, develop magnetic energy, and strengthen your fascinative force. From muscle tension exercises to gazing exercises, to practicing presence, these exercises can transform your mind and body. It only takes a few minutes each day to perform these exercises, and the benefits obtained will be profound. So why not give them a try and experience the power of these basic exercises for yourself?"
