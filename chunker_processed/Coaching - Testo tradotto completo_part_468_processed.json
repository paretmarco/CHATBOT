  "first_phrase": "In this final section of the text, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the true purpose for working in financial markets rather than solely focusing on earning money. They use the analogy of a bicycle rider to explain that just as a cyclist must also think about where they want to go, those in trading must also consider their goals beyond just making money. The author suggests that defining an \"ecological\" objective that goes beyond money can help shift the focus and make trading more effective. The text also discusses the importance of honesty and self-awareness in finding one's objective.",
  "content": "The question which imposes itself on us in this context is thus the following: What is it that we truly want? We have the tendency of placing excessive focus on money because the society in which we live teaches that the more money one owns the greater the level of happiness he might attain. We must think, on the other hand, that in the event we succeed in earning plenty of money within a short period of time, we might also be empowered thereby to change our life, whereupon we would be enabled to do many things we were precluded before from doing. The “ecological” objective has the benefit of defining what we want to do as soon as we have earned up to the desired level. By proceeding in that fashion, money will stop being the primary objective, and will turn into a means to fulfil something more tangible. The frames of the self and some recommendation for effective trading Every man is a balance and a totality made of a multiplicity of levels. The demarcation of an objective demands a far-reaching extent of honesty at all these different levels.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, defining an objective that goes beyond earning money can empower us to live a fulfilling life. It's important to maintain coherence between our different levels and take care of our physical health to ensure effective decision-making. So, let's focus not just on acquiring wealth but on creating an objective that benefits our overall well-being."
