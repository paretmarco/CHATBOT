  "title": "\"What is Kairòs time and how can living in the present moment lead to a higher plane of functioning?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the concept of \"Kairòs\" as an intuitive time to live in the moment and seize opportunities life offers. In the last 200 tokens, the author gives an example of how to act in the moment, based on the present reality rather than past programming. The author highlights the significance of \"Kairòs\" as the only time enabling effective work with subtle realities.",
  "content": "It is an opening, a time of opportunities to grab, as such corresponding to a more elevated understanding of the present moment. To give an example: I cannot leave due to a strike being staged. If I were to analyze reality from the viewpoint of my mental program, I would either get furious or I would try to act. If I am plunged in the ? ???? ?, what I find myself is would be represented instead by a moment where a reality exists and everything is possible. When I move within that level, whichever action I choose to embark upon will not be based on any past programming, but rather on what is present in the now, which is after all the only time there is. It is as if my brain was a newborn child who had come to discover the world in that particular instant. It is a form of discovering harmonious concord with some cosmic rhythm.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of \"kairòs\" represents a unique opportunity to go beyond our past programming and enter a dimension of subtle realities where everything is possible. By establishing a link with reality and expanding our consciousness, we can attain substantial results and progress at supersonic speed towards our goals. To fully benefit from the time of \"kairòs,\" one may implement specific exercises that promote better functioning of the brain and enhance energetic attention to the now. Seize the moment, and embrace the time of \"kairòs\" for a deeper understanding of the present and more significant personal growth."
