  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author describes how seemingly mundane experiences like listening to a tune or getting lost in thought can induce non-symptomatic and transitory trance states. However, there are deeper trance states that develop in response to childhood trauma, becoming ingrained patterns of defense in adulthood. In the last 200 words, the author expands on how we can distinguish between helpful and harmful trance states by exercising choice and control over our attention. The author gives examples of how we can consciously choose to focus our attention or let our minds wander. This highlights the importance of self-awareness in managing our trance states and their impact on our well-being.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to understanding our trance states is choice. We can choose to stay in a trance that is part of the solution or easily return our focus attention. However, we become identified and trapped in problematic trance states that involve painful memories and negative hallucinations. By breaking free from our attachment and identification with our transient inner world, we can transcend the grip of problematic trance states and live a more present and fulfilling life."
