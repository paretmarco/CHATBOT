  "title": "How can you create a comprehensive life plan based on the different frames of the self?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author lays out a plan for a period of life that moves from immutable conditions to uncertain ones. The plan is divided into a number of segments, from yearly to daily plans, and encompasses all elements of one's activity, which the author terms \"frames of the self\". These frames, such as physical, economic, cultural/spiritual, and relationships, must complement each other and take turns so that no one frame encroaches upon the others. In this way, the spiritual side must not trample on other sides, nor be trampled upon. The author emphasizes the importance of a well-reasoned life plan that takes into account all elements of one's self.",
  "content": "The constituent elements of the life plan A well-reasoned life plan must include all the elements making up our activity, which must combine with one another on the basis of paying due regard to their relative degrees of importance and the mutual impact they exercise on each other. We shall term these elements “frames of the self”, inasmuch as they are related to our different selves. Current State Ideal State Physical State (Health) Physical State (Health) Economic State Economic State Cultural/Spiritual State Cultural/Spiritual State Relationships Relationships Pleasures Pleasures How to coordinate the different frames of the self It would be a mistake to devote one part of our life only to a specific part of ourselves. At any given time, in fact, we represent a whole. The various frames must take turns between one another, thereby complementing each other in such a way that no one of them encroaches upon the others. Thus, neither success nor culture must prevail over the sphere of affections or the field of one's personal relationships. In a similar fashion, the spiritual side must neither be trampled upon not trampling other sides by.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to ensure a well-rounded and fulfilling life, it's crucial to include all the constituent elements in our life plan and coordinate them effectively. We must give each frame of the self its due importance and allow them to complement and alternate with each other, without one encroaching on the others. Above all, we must prioritize our physical state, as it serves as the foundation for our vital energy and overall well-being."
