  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, Wolinsky guides Barbara through a meditation exercise where she visualizes herself and her mother as separate entities within the void of the \"Not Me.\" As the exercise progresses, Wolinsky encourages Barbara to see the emptiness that they're both floating in and create strategies to merge the two entities into a single entity. After the exercise, Barbara experiences intense vibration and energy and a sense of nonexistence while Debra discusses her feelings of betrayal and anger towards John's newfound independence.",
  "content": "Now, create strategies so some how you can make this alleged \"Not Me\" somehow the same as the \"I\" you call yourself. Notice the EMPTINESS they are both floating in and see them all as made of the same substance. How are you doing now? Barbara:Okay. Very intense vibration and energy. Wolinsky:How does it all seem to you now? Barbara:Nonexistence is a nonissue. I don't even know. ...Silence. (No words) Wolinsky:Anything you want to say to me? Barbara:What a trip. ________________ Debra:John. Wolinsky:So John, I assume, has his own life, separate from yours. Debra: Wolinsky: Debra: Yes, very much so. And that makes you feel? At first, he didn't have a separate life and now he is starting to have a separate life. So now it makes me feel betrayed. I feel angry and then I go into, well, two months ago, he could hardly wait to see me and now it's not that big a deal for him. He would rather be on his land in the middle of nowhere.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, as a therapist, it is important to confront the client's game with their best interest at heart, but always staying in essence. If you can recognize false core distractors and drivers, you can help your clients move towards a more fulfilling life, and confront the emptiness they are experiencing by finding their true selves."
