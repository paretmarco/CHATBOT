  "title": "What is the Principle III of Transference in Psychoanalysis and its relation to self-talk and inner child rebelliousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the concept of the inner child and its impact on behavior was explored. Now, Principle III delves deeper into the inner workings of the inner child, specifically how it relates to the psychoanalytic model of transference. The rebel identity of the inner child, when not in conflict with the fused identity of \"Dad,\" tends to resist the fused identity outside of oneself. This process, called trance-ference, is when the client projects their parent onto a therapist and begins to treat them as such. The rebel identity, representing the resisting child, imagines authority figures to be Mom/Dad and acts accordingly. This can lead to conflicts in present time, resulting in the need for self-awareness and responsibility. The text also touches upon the relationship between self-talk and the father's voice.",
  "content": "For de-hypnosis to occur the observer, who has been asleep, must wake-up and take responsibility for this internal conflict. As an example, the rebel (resisting Dad) identity called \"I want to be me,\" will imagine, experience, or expect someone in authority to give her a hard time. It appears as though the person is attempting to be herself, while the inner child is actually reacting to a trans- ferred image of Mom or Dad. Stated another way, the fused Father is projected or trance-(erred. The rebel (I want to be me) identity stays inside or vice versa. This explains why many people automati- cally assume that authority figures will push them around and they begin to fight them before that actually occurs. How does this apply to self-talk? The child becomes the Father by duplicating the father' s voice through a series of interactions with Father; the child identifies and fuses, through verbal dialogue, or non-verbal body posture, his looks, expressions, feelings and even tapes of the father's voice. If the child chooses to resist his father, he reflects a rebel identity.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to break free from the cycle of internal conflict and projection, it is essential to become aware of our self-talk and its origins. By taking responsibility for our inner dialogue trances and identifying the rebel and Dad identities within us, we can begin to address and transform our unconscious patterns of thought and behavior. By noticing and writing down our self-talk, we can gain valuable insights into our inner world and take the necessary steps towards healing and growth."
