  "title": "What is the significance of the container concept in Beyond Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final segment, Alice and Wolinsky delve deeper into the concept of the container and how it relates to Alice's emotions. They discuss externalizing the container and how Alice is feeling \"shimmering inside and outside the walls of the room.\" Wolinsky asks Alice about her attempts to deceive the container and whether the \"I am alone\" identity is part of the collapse or part of her. They ultimately reach a state of spaciousness, realizing that without the container or false core, there is just the essential quality of being. This marks a breakthrough for Alice in her journey toward healing.",

Wolinsky:How have you tried to deceive the container?Wolinsky:Regarding this container is there a gravitational collapse around this central core? Wolinsky:Why would you want to deceive the container? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter III Wolinsky:Tell me an emotion that emerges from that col- lapsing around the central core. Alice:Safetydiscomfort, and alone. Therapeutic Note Here Alice has moved beyond the False Core-False Self of I am Alone. I hope to effortlessly connect her to her Essential Core with no judgement, evaluation or significance about it. Wolinsky: So the alone identity is part of the collapse. Is the \"I am alone\" Identity part of the collapse, or part of you? They are the same. Are you it? No. What's happening now? Spacious. Therapeutic Note Once the container and the False Core are gone beyond, there is just the Essential quality of spaciousness. Is the alone the by-product of the collapse? Yes, no collapse, no alone. I am really blown away by this.",
  "last_phrase": "As you explore and move beyond your false core, you may start to realize a sense of spaciousness and connectivity that allows energy to flow more freely. This can help you feel more connected to those around you, and help you develop a more profound understanding of your Essential core."
