The previous exercise guided you in exploring the emotion of anger, observing what it feels like in your body, and labeling it as energy rather than a negative emotion. In Chapter VIII, we dive deeper into the biological dimension of manifestation and embodying quantum consciousness. We refer to other sources for a greater explanation and depth.",
