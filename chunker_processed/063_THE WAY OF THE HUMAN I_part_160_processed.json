  "title": "\"What is the 'Who told you that?' thinking exercise and its purpose?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this sixth chapter, the author introduces the Thinking Dimension Exercise #3 focused on cultivating the understanding that all information comes from the mind. By constantly asking yourself \"Who told you that?\" when a thought arises, you will begin to understand that thoughts are the mind. This practice can also be done with a partner, asking the same question and answering truthfully. The author suggests practicing for seven to ten minutes and avoiding identifying with any thought. The chapter ends by mentioning a book from the Indian saint Ananda Mayi Ma.",
  "content": "Whenever anything comes into your awareness, the question will be asked of you by a partner, \"Who told you that?\" and the answer is, \"The mind.\" The only way you could possibly know what you are feeling or experiencing is if the voice in the back of your head says, \"I'm happy\" or \"I'm sad\"or whatever. A student asked, \"Why is it the mind?\" I replied, \"Because it's made of thoughts. Thoughts that are identified with, become my thoughts. So, really, it's the mind and the thoughts. Also, for the seeding for future understanding, there is only one mind, not many minds (to be discussed in Volume III). Practice: I'd like you to sit for about seven to ten minutes and notice each thought as it comes through your awareness. Say to yourself, \"Who told you that?\" Then answer, \"The mind.\" The aim is to not identify with anything that comes through your mind. There's a book by a woman saint, Ananda Mayi Ma, who died about 1980.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing awareness of the origin and transience of thoughts can help us detach from them and develop a deeper understanding of our own mind. Asking ourselves \"Who told you that?\" and \"Where does that thought subside to?\" can lead us to greater self-awareness and a more grounded sense of being."
