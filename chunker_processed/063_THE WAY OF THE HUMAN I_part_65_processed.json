  "title": "What is the False Core-False Self in Quantum Psychology and why is it essential to dismantle it?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the importance of acknowledging and dismantling the False Core-False Self in order to stabilize in one's true self, such as ESSENCE or I AM. The previous section talked about how many spiritual leaders are able to function well in their home countries where people take care of their personal needs. However, when they move to America or Western Europe and their external context changes, their uncooked seeds begin to sprout and they fall into the trap of money, fame, and sex. To prevent this from happening, one must be aware of their False Core-False Self and not shy from it, acknowledging and dismantling it. The text also mentions that the False Core-False Self is the driving force of one's individual mind, hence its importance. Different False Core Drivers and False Self Compensators were explained as well, using the scenario of a five-year-old child being molested as an example.",
  "content": "An uncooked seed which remains unacknowledged has the potential to sprout as soon as the external dimension or context changes. Quantum Psychology suggests utilizing awareness and dismantling your uncooked seeds so that they no longer sprout and grab your awareness and pull you out of ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc. The #1 uncooked seed of your psychology is the False Core-False Self because it drives the entire machinery of what you call the individual Mind. You cannot meditate your False Core-False Self away. You cannot mantra your False Core-False Self away. You have to be willing to look at and acknowledge everything that is there. Without dismantling the False Core-False Self which drives \"your\" psychology, \"you\" can never stabilize in ESSENCE, I AM, etc. THROUGH THE FALSE CORE DRIVER-FALSE SELF COMPENSATOR LENS Let's look at this through the eyes of different False Core Drivers and False Self Compensators. Let's say at age five, a child is molested: One False Core would say, \"There's something wrong with me, that's the reason this happened.\" Another False Core would say \"I'm worthless, even Uncle Henry is treating me as if I'm worthless.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To truly stabilize in your essence and break free from the False Core-False Self driving your psychology, you must first acknowledge and dismantle your uncooked seeds. Quantum Psychology suggests developing multi-dimensional awareness to see through the different lenses of false core drivers and false self compensators. Only then can you begin to heal and grow beyond past traumas and limiting beliefs, and stabilize in your true self, I AM."
