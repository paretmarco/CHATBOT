  "title": "\"What is the importance of being attentive to the world outside ourselves for true success and freedom?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of our finite existence in the universe and how we should perceive our minimal significance objectively while at the same time, realizing that it grants us the ability to affect change within ourselves and the world around us. The author references the Tao Te King and the notion that True Man advances by Retreating, asserting that by paying less heed to our egos, we become more open and benevolent towards others. Additionally, the author argues that the key to successful social relationships lies in listening to others and truly interacting with them. Only then can we achieve a sense of true freedom despite the societal constraints we face.",
  "content": "Paying less heed to our egos, and doing so on an ongoing basis, allows us in fact to be more open and benevolent towards other people. Through that, we might finally be able to listen to what they are saying, understanding what they are feeling (without of course letting ourselves becoming involved), realizing the value of every person and thereby improving our social relationships. Many people, indeed, believe, out of pride, that they are able to make other persons act the way they want, but the truth is that the key to successful social relationships lies only in listening to them, in truly interacting with them. We are free The sense of being free is a harder prize to conquer. It is that sense of freedom which being present ultimately leads one to. Man is a social animal — and that is absolutely true —, but he is also, socially and, even more so, historically useless, if he refuses to change in order to avoid moving out of the coordinates which the society he lives in has drawn up.",
  "last_phrase": "To improve our social relationships, we must prioritize listening to others without letting ourselves become involved, realizing the unique value of each person. By nurturing our originality and refusing to be absorbed by societal norms out of fear, we can achieve true freedom, no longer being useless beings in society."
