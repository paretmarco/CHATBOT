  "content": "We use the term \"persuasive fascination\" to denote the practical application of fascination within the context of daily communication. The most glaring and typical manifestation of “personal power\" consists in the art of persuading 1. The person who holds the keys to that art is readily believed in respect of whatever he says, and evinces a form of hegemony over his fellow human beings. In this course we will deal with how to use gaze and non verbal communication to enhance your effectiveness and Charisma. We will also work with the “hypno-selling” system, a method based on words and other elements as NLP-3 aimed at giving you more capacity of persuading other people.

Mr. de Constant then took me aside, and asked me which part of the subject he should paralyze by his silent will?",
