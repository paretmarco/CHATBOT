  "content": "The vital energy represents the second element in the under-stated fundamental dyad, which represents the essential key to achieve any thing: The Fundamental dyad 1 – Consciousness of what we do in the now and over time 2 –Vital Energy The vital energy, which is the foundation that underpins true personal magnetism, is chiefly physical in nature. It consists in vitality. Usually, however, we are devoid of true consciousness of it. When that is the case, which is the normal scenario, vital energy is merely used and consumed away in the effort of preserving our habits. Many people’s reactions are piloted by a tiny little ego which is capricious and wasteful in setting out to attain its objectives. Such objectives accordingly fritter away this vital energy in the undertaking of aimless actions. A parallel exists between what we do with mental energy and what we do with the gifts and possibilities life offers us, such as relationships and our money. Avoiding dispersions of mental energy and channelling it in the right direction represent human engagements which need to be carried out in order to increase energy, and thereby expand the range of our active doing. If we concentrate, the greater amplitude of mental power which is generated by concentration has the effect of us developing power in reality and naturally transcending habits. When that stage is reached, we will then be capable of enjoying the opportunities life supplies us with. The aim of a coach is to develop the skills and potential of the coachee.",
