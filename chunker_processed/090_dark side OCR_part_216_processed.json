  "title": "How does the religious system perpetuate itself through transpersonal transference?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the impact of religious systems on children and adults. The religious system prioritizes its own self-referential ideas and spiritualizes the absence of answers to maintain its hierarchy, both in the family and in larger organizations like the Catholic Church. The last 200 tokens focus on the problem state of transparency, where the child projects the idea of transparency in the idealized guru/parent and develops a reverse grandiosity. The child also transfers parental values and lessons onto God, making him a superhuman figure, resulting in actions based on what God wants, similar to what the parents want for their child. Spiritual reframes are used by the child within the adult to explain the lack of desired events in their lives.",
  "content": "Problem states con- tinue to occur as the child within trance-fers his spiritualizing onto others. For example, the child imagines himself to be transparent and that the idealized guru/parent can see his every thought, or knows his real self. This is grandiosity in reverse. Here the child idealizes and trance-fers grandiose powers on another figure, making the person a superhuman God/guru, thus making the figure grandiose. Trance-fer of Values and Lessons In other forms of transpersonal transference, the child trance- fers parental values to God. Here the child develops the trance of transferring to God his parents' good/bad system, which the child has taken on to survive. Now, good actions (the ones Dad and Mom like) are what God wants. Bad actions become what God doesn't want. Parental punishment occurs when a child doesn't get some- thing from her parents. The parent says, \"You're not getting this to learn a lesson.\" Years later, when the adult doesn't get something in life she wants, the infant/child within the adult uses spiritual reframes like, \"God is trying to teach me a lesson.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize and understand the different forms of transpersonal transference that can occur in childhood and continue to impact us as adults. By identifying these patterns, we can work to break free from limiting beliefs and behaviors, and cultivate a more authentic and fulfilling spiritual path that aligns with our own unique values and aspirations."
