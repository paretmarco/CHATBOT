  "title": "What is the importance of setting clear and achievable trading goals to succeed in the market?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author emphasizes the importance of setting clear and specific goals when trading. Common phrases like \"earning a lot\" or \"earning quickly\" lack a precise definition and can lead to stress and poor decision-making. Instead, traders should focus on defining their desired earnings within a certain timeframe and energy level. By analyzing past market events, traders can identify underlying conditions that statistically increase their chances of success. While setting non-monetary goals may be challenging for traders, the author suggests it is necessary to adapt to the rules of the market.",
  "content": "The main reason why most people do not achieve what they are aiming at, in fact, is the circumstance that they do not actually know what it is that they want. The future is an unknown variable, and the only thing we can know for sure is whatever has taken place until the current moment. History teaches us a wealth of different things, and all that has occurred in the markets up to the present day can be analyzed by us in such a way that we might discern, at the root of those events, the existence of underlying conditions which statistically granted us a chance to score gains. One gets an abundance of persons who engage in trading and wish never to experience failure in any one of their operations; the market, instead, has its own rules and drives on in terms of its own rules. We are, therefore, the component who is required to adapt to it. It is difficult, for a person who engages in trading, to set for himself a goal which is disconnected from money.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, defining a clear and non-monetary goal is essential to achieving success in trading. By focusing on underlying conditions and adapting to the market's rules, we can increase our chances of success. It's important to maintain self-detachment from money and emotions, allowing us to stay focused and build a foundation for our goals to materialize."
