  "title": "How can shifting our attention to biological sensation improve our sexual experiences?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed how pain arises when we replace biology with psychological substitution. Now, the focus shifts towards exercises that enable a person to address these tendencies by concentrating on biological sensation. The section titled \"Working with Biological Needs\" explains how to reduce suffering by rooting back to biology. The next exercise called \"Sexuality Focus,\" aims to shift one's awareness from sexual fantasies and memories of other people towards focusing on the energy itself. By doing so, it helps in breaking the habitual pattern of focusing on the fantasy of sexuality and placing attention on the feeling of energy.",
  "content": "Your mind is always popping up pictures of a sexual fantasy in some form or another. More than likely, you won't get too much satisfaction because you'll always be fantasizing about somebody else outside of yourself. During the years I was celibate I noticed that I had incredible fantasies. Since the fantasies were still there, so were the bodily reactions and I had a difficult time for two years. It was a 1800 shift from my sexual behavior in the 1960's and 1970's where free sexuality was the rule and everybody slept with everybody. When I started this exercise, it shifted my habitual pattern of the way I focused my awareness on the fantasy of sexuality by placing my attention on the energy itself. Where did I feel it? The process is similar to the emotional one except that now we're going to look at what is normally labeled as one that's more pleasant. Shift your attention away from the fantasy, or away from the movie in your mind, and place your attention on the energy itself. Notice what happens as you start focusing your attention on the sexual feelings as energy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you find yourself constantly fantasizing about someone else outside of yourself and not getting much satisfaction, try shifting your attention to the energy of the sexual feelings within you. Instead of focusing on the fantasy and trying to fulfill it externally, place your attention on the sensations arising within you. With practice and awareness, you may find a deeper level of satisfaction and fulfillment within yourself."
