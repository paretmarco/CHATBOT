  "title": "How can meeting problems at their appropriate level lead to Multi-Dimensional Awareness and dismantle survival mechanisms in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of addressing psychological problems on the psychological level. They argue that survival mechanisms fuse with past events, making it difficult to distinguish present threats. To dismantle these mechanisms, one needs to cut the associational network. The text concludes that each dimension has a different function and that while spiritual philosophies may not cure psychological issues, they can reinforce false cores. The author warns against superimposing philosophy onto false cores and stresses the need to meet problems at the level they occur.",
  "content": "You might get Rolfed forever, it doesn't mean it is going to handle your relationship issues. Meet the problem at the level of the problem or refer them to someone who can work with them at that level. If someone has a bad back, yes, maybe we can cure it with prayer. But it might be wiser to see a chiropractor, a Feldenkrais practitioner or a Rolfer. Quantum Psychology feels that there is a danger in giving someone a philosophy which they cannot take in. For example, if someone has their attention on their False Core and you tell them something like, \"YoU are not the doer,\" that statement only gets superimposed onto their False Core. The philosophy cannot go in, it can only be used to reinforce their False Core (see Volume II). Each dimension has a different function. It's the function of the thinking dimension to think. It's a function of the emotional dimension to have emotions. It's the function of the biological dimension to shit. It makes as much sense to say sexual abstinence will lead you to God as not going to the bathroom will lead you to God.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to address problems at their respective levels to find the most effective solutions. While philosophy and prayer can be helpful, it is important to refer someone to a specialist when dealing with certain issues such as a bad back. Similarly, each dimension has its unique function, and it is crucial not to impose or overlap them. Developing functional awareness and flexibility in where one places their awareness can lead to greater subjective experience of freedom."
