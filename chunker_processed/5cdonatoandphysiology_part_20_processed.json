  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author describes the most effective processes used to gain the influence and submission of others. The author reveals his theory: by surprising his subjects he can obtain paralysis, aphony, etc. without prior preparation. The author then details his first process of making the patient press their hands firmly on his, pushing them back suddenly, and quickly staring into their eyes. The technique of \"fascination,\" previously used by Donato, is also discussed. The author notes that the success of these processes is dependent on the operator's ability and patient's idiosyncrasies. This section highlights the power dynamics involved in the process of gaining influence over others.",
  "content": "FIRST PROCESS The principal consists in making the patient press his hands strongly on mine. Suddenly I push him backward and I quickly plunge my glance into his eyes. Surprised, he recoils, and immediately the expression of his eyes indicates to me his degree of impressionability. \"The fascination used for the first time by Donato has already been described by Doctor Bremaud. Donato, who operates specially on young people, proceeds as follows: He asks the subject to apply the palms of his hands on his own, which are stretched horizon tally, and to press downward with all his strength. The attention and all the physical strength of the subject are absorbed in this manoeuvre, while his concentrated innervation toward the muscular effort prevents his thoughts from being distracted. Donato looks at quickly, brusquely and very near; the operator then turns round the subject, continuing to fix and provoke him with his glance; the latter, as though attracted and fascinated, follows him with wide open eyes which can no more be detached from his own. It is a matter of suggestion by gesture.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, there are various methods for inducing hypnotism, including physical touch and eye contact. It is important to note that hypnotism is a form of suggestion, and its effectiveness relies on striking the subject's imagination and convincing them of a certain reality. As with any practice involving the mind, it is crucial to approach hypnotism with caution and respect."
