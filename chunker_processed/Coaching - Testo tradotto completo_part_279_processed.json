  "first_phrase": "This section provides guidance on planning daily activities to achieve long-term goals. The text covers creating a list of tasks, prioritizing them based on their mental demand, and tracking their completion. It then shifts to setting out activities to be done over an indefinite period in a separate column, and marking completed tasks. The author emphasizes the importance of having a plan that aligns with one's long-term goals. The reader is encouraged to ask important questions, including what activities they need to carry out to realize their plan.",
  "content": "This column, too, is preceded by a small column which is destined to serve the purpose of indicating, by placing a cross next to each relevant operation, all the various operations as they gradually find their own definitive location within the plan. Useful questions relating to the Formulation of the Plans 1. Which part of the life plan am I going to accomplish today (or during the current year or this month)? This represents the minimal program, which every thing must be subordinated to, having regard to the circumstances and trying to exploit them so as for them to serve our purpose. 2. Which are the actions, therefore, that I should carry out in order to realize this part of the life plan? (This makes up the basic underlying layer of the daily plan). Subordinately: Being unable, due to the presence of special contingent circumstances, to accomplish anything by which I might progress towards the fulfilment of my life plan, what can I at least do not to be distanced from its actualization? Alternatively, what am I in a position to do which is at least useful to my person? 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following these five useful questions related to planning, you can prioritize your life's goals, take consistent actions towards them, even in adverse situations, and continually monitor and evaluate your progress. Regularly reviewing your previous plans, analyzing your day-to-day activities, and aligning them with your deeper self and desires will keep you on track towards achieving a fulfilling life. Remember to cross off completed tasks and celebrate your accomplishments on this journey."
