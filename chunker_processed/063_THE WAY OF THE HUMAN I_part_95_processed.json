  "title": "How can offering meditation or therapy that doesn't suit a person lead to reinforcement of their defenses?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author highlights the importance of knowing which type of therapy or meditation suits an individual. For instance, offering insight meditation to an over-observer who dissociates may reinforce their structure, while suggesting a vice-to-virtue conversion to an individual with a strong Christian background may strengthen their false self. In the last part, the author provides an example of a woman who developed a protective image of herself as a little girl, which relaxed her yielding safety and comfort when dealing with trauma. The author warns that introducing certain body positions and breathing practices may only reinforce an individual's trauma, further emphasizing the importance of \"one-size-does-not-fit-all\" in psychology and spirituality.",
  "content": "Three things revealed themselvesâ€”I) she had her concepts connected to her spine and they were activated by her sitting up straight (in a meditation posture); 2), her concepts and trauma were attached around, and re-activated by, the control of her breathing and thinking (i.e., slowing her breath and stopping her thoughts); and 3) to defend herself against \"feeling\" the trauma she had developed an image of herself as a little girl standing in the sunlight and hanging-up clothes which relaxed her yielding safety and comfort. If we examine this, we can easily see that if she got involved with a \"spiritual\" system which said you needed to sit up straight, spine erect, or watch or control your breathing or thoughts, it would only re-enforce her concepts and the trauma itself because it would ask her to unknowingly re-enforce the biological component (body position) which held the system together. If she went to a therapist who stressed a \"symbol of safety\" (like an Ericksonian hypnotherapist), this might make her \"feel\" more comfortable and relaxed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to understand that one size does not fit all in terms of healing trauma and pursuing spirituality. Rather, seeking out personalized and specific instruction from a qualified practitioner can help avoid re-enforcing the trauma and promote genuine growth and healing. It's crucial to prioritize genuine progress over financial gain in our pursuit of psycho-spiritual wellness."
