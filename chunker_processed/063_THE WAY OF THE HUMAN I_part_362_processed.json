  "title": "How can realizing our own humanness promote compassion and freedom in therapy sessions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the importance of realizing the humanness of the therapist and the client is emphasized. The author discusses how this realization leads to an experience of compassion and humanity. Additionally, the issue of separation in spiritual trances and its connection to trance-ference and countertrance-ference issues is explored. The author highlights how this issue can create problems in relationships and limit freedom and humanity. This discussion builds upon the concept of idealization and de-idealization explored in the text.",
  "content": "There I was, totally therapy trained for years, a client for years, years of meditation, years of living in India—when I looked around the room, there was a secretary, a painter, an astrologer, and a housewife. I realized that I was the same as them—and all of my defenses vanished. I instantly saw everyone there as the same. It was the most important \"spiritual experience\" I had ever had—it was a total connection to being human and to humanity. THE PROBLEM OF SEPARATION: THE GLUE THAT HOLDS SPIRITUAL TRANCES TOGETHER In guru/disciple, teacher/student, therapist/client and love relationships, separation is always a problem. If the guru/disciple, teacher/student or therapist/client is running trance-ference/ countertrance-ference issues (narcissistic), then the teacher, guru or therapist (just like mom and dad) becomes threatened at the possible loss (separation) of a disciple, student or client. This is why they put them down when they attempt to individuate. Teachers, gurus or therapists say things like, \"They are not surrendered,\" \"They are resisting,\" or \"They have some worldly karma to work out.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the problem of separation is ubiquitous in human relationships, both spiritual and personal. Understanding this issue and recognizing when it arises can help individuals avoid falling into traps of co-dependency or narcissism. By embracing the shared human experience, we can shed our defenses and connect more deeply with those around us."
