  "title": "\"How can traders develop intuition through informed instinct and the development of distinctions?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the text, we explored how \"informed instinct\" can help develop intuition. This works by relying on a higher level of functioning of the brain, which is built by a specific process of development related to accumulated experience. In this final part, we dive deeper into the two essential aspects of the intuitive process. The text features the famous financier, George Soros, who has vast experience in this field. The focus is on how the mind works out distinctions through experience, similar to opting for differently colored boxes to order items in our house. Building such distinctions through observables is of fundamental importance to avoid unchecked thought drifting.",
  "content": "In order for the mind to be able to reason and give expression to its results, it is in fact necessary that it should be able to work out distinctions which are built through experience. It is somewhat similar to the scenario where, in order to make some order in our house, we opted to make use of a series of differently coloured boxes instead of indiscriminately throwing all items into one single box. Many traders do not make suitable distinctions, and lack knowledge on how to train their mind to develop such process. If we were to use quantum terms, we would refer to \"observables\". An \"observable\" is, in essence, the defining of a possible result. The definition of observables is of fundamental importance to the task of avoiding the danger of thought drifting away unchecked, in the same way that, if we do not have boxes where we might place objects, we would be disabled from \"ordering\" reality. The ideal would be for all the boxes to be filled in a balanced manner, so as to eschew the situation where some of them remained empty while others were filled beyond capacity.",
  "last_phrase": "In order for traders to make suitable distinctions, they need to train their mind to develop relevant processes. Building on the analogy of using different colored boxes to organize items, traders must define \"observables\" to avoid unchecked thought-drifting. A balanced quantum register can enable the mind to function better, leading to better trading results."
