  "first_phrase": "This final section delves into a specific exercise for achieving a state of pleasant calm and concentration. The exercise involves mentally tracing the mathematical sign for infinity without ever deflecting the mind. The goal is to reach a centralized and powerful mental state. The author emphasizes the importance of daily practice and rest for achieving mastery of this art. \nFurthermore, the author encourages the reader to consciously awaken their unconscious side and make use of silence whenever nature affords the chance to taste it.",
  "content": "You should accordingly picture yourselves seeing this immensely huge sign as a luminous one protruding out of a dark background. You must then, beginning from any point whatsoever, follow the continuing curve, without ever taking off the eyes of the mind. This exercise has the ability to lead one to be more present, and not to be excessively stuck in a sensory system (= not to be excessively visual, audial or kinaesthetic), choosing instead to preserve a centralized and powerful state 31. Ten minutes of daily physical and psychological rest, if possible spent while lying on the bed, in some dark and silent environment, will refresh the body and the spirit as much as one hour of normal sleep would be able to do. In order to master the practice of this art, however, we need to make a daily effort. We need, in other words, to consciously awaken our unconscious side. Through the medium of a sufficient dose of commitment, one might eventually learn how to detach himself completely, regardless of which place he might happen to be in. Few people know the true silence of the spirit. You should make use of silence whenever nature affords you the chance of tasting it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking ten minutes of physical and psychological rest each day, practicing detachment, embracing moments of silence, and mastering the ability to regulate and still our thoughts can all lead to increased presence, personal magnetism, and a deeper appreciation for life. With daily effort and commitment, we can learn to relish life with greater intensity, renewing pleasures and experiencing them with increased liveliness."
