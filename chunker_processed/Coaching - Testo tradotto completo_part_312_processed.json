  "title": "\"How can abolishing the first-person singular and instantaneous mono-ideation improve your perception and concentration?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author talked about how to abolish the first person singular \"I\" when identifying one's own actions. They suggested using the third person singular or the infinitive verb to change one's perspective. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the concept of Instantaneous Mono-ideation, which involves working on lightning-fast pre-visualizations that precede the actions one is required to carry out. This complex act of presentification antedates the action and is linked to other mono-ideations by the plan for the day. The text emphasizes the importance of clarity and emotional power to guarantee success in practical implementation.",
  "content": "If, owing to general presentification, our plan has in a sense become alive inside us, and one overwhelmingly determined to be actualized outwardly, the substitution of personality puts the conscious side to rest, thereby entrusting to the unconscious the task of acting on our behalf. Essentially, — as one can see —, in addition to the general presentification, we ought to work on a series of lightning-fast pre-visualizations, which are parallel and antecedent to the actions we are required to carry out. This presentification witnesses the simultaneous entry in it of the image of the action which the self is called upon to undertake, and, lastly, the image of our self as modified by the action once it has been implemented. This complex act of presentification which antedates the action is what we call Instantaneous Mono-ideation. It ensues from it that the day of an active person might be reduced to a series of extremely quick mono-ideations, which are linked to one another by the plan for the day.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve successful accomplishment, it is crucial to concentrate on a singular idea or issue and halt all other stimulations. This can be achieved through instantaneous mono-ideation, which involves pre-visualizing actions and modifying the self-image accordingly. Concentration can be improved by following normative precepts such as those outlined in this text. By adopting these practices, one can attain the right mental posture and readily take action."
