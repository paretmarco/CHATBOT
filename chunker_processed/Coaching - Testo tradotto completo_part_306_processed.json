  "title": "How can we create an ideal human type and cultivate self-respect?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus is on how to create an ideal image of oneself and use it as a guide for personal development. The author suggests using a large mirror to imagine the ideal image and projecting oneself onto it. They also recommend imagining oneself in the presence of a wise and authoritative friend who can provide guidance in difficult situations. The concept of self-respect is also discussed as an essential element in personal growth. By committing to the habit of acting with respect for oneself and others, a person can become a model of physical and mental correctness.",
  "content": "Through such means, we might be able, in every moment of our life, including those moments when we happen to be alive, to automatically rectify ourselves until we reach a stage when, by the sheer strength of an unconscious habit, we turn into models of physical and mental correctness, thereby taking proper care of our outer garment, our attitude, our speech, and our comportment. An important role in this connection is going to be played by the concept of self-respect, which in the ultimate analysis consists in the habit of acting before our consciousness in the way one would be acting vis-Ã -vis a person of high esteem. What we do should be undertaken out of respect for other people, sure, but even to a greater extent, a fortiori, out of self-respect. We shall finally seal the teaching of this immediate transmission of a specific psychological state by suggesting that, whenever we might find ourselves intimidated, in the street or in somebody's living room, we should visualize beside us some authoritative friend who, with his charisma, might be able to shield our smallness. The procedure as thought here might be successfully applied to any kind of critical situation we might find ourselves thrown into.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a habit of self-respect and visualizing authoritative figures can help us overcome intimidating situations. Cultivating initiative means being resolute in our actions and venturing outside of familiar patterns to discover new possibilities. Let's work on building our confidence and taking decisive action, instead of being hindered by indecisiveness."
