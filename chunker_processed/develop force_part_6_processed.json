  "title": "What is the power of the eye?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author delves into the power of the eye and the secrets that are correlated to it. They describe how through the power of thought, Virgilio was able to wake up a customer who assumed a woman's name in a probative exercise, thus demonstrating the power of the eye. The author also highlights how the ability to subjugate the energies possessed by the look can extend to the power to enchant and create \"an instantaneous hypnosis.\" The present book is devoted to the power of the eye, its ancient roots, and its profound comprehensive text on the subject, which also draws on the contributions of the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa.",
  "content": "At that point, Virgilio carried out a facetious probative exercise: Faced with the question on what his name was, such customer answered by mentioning a woman’s name which had not even been verbally suggested (to him by Virgilio), only through the power of thought. Virgilio thereupon woke him up. Moved by his curiosity, Max took to Virgilio a number of his friends, and witnessed similar events on several other occasions. Even I succeeded in experiencing on my own skin the power of this seemingly quiet person who, besides the ability I have just described, had also developed a special sensitivity to energies, to such an extent that he was a capable medical diviner equipped with the talent to retrieve an object concealed inside a room. Where does all of this originate? Having intuitively realized that recourse to such technique might have stretched even beyond what we had been witnesses to, and that this power might be used for the additional purpose of making people feel better, we resolved on becomingVirgilio’s students and intimate associates, to whom he could have confided his secrets. We then realized that, in order to attain such power, what is needed is a disciplined work upon one’s own self, which is also grounded on a series of techniques and exercises encompassing self-control as well as self-development and self-improvement. Virgilio is not, however, the only exponent of such school which we owe our knowledge of the subject to. A contribution to the completion of this work was also made by the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination through the power of the look has been a technique in use since ancient times, capable of captivating and influencing others in various ways. Through disciplined and specific training, one can develop this power and use it for both personal growth as well as in the therapeutic field. However, it is crucial to use this power ethically, with a positive and development-bound mindset. Fascination is a tool that can be used for good, and with proper training, it can open new doors in life."
