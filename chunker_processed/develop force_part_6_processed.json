  "title": "What is the power of the eye and how can it be harnessed for personal growth, persuasion, and even therapeutic purposes?",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text delves into the power of the eye and its correlation to fascinating others. The concept of fascination has a scientific basis in physics and has been used as a therapeutic ability by certain healers throughout history. The text speaks to the ancient practice of transmitting the power of the eye from master to disciple without the use of written texts. The author recounts their personal experience with Virgilio T. 2, the last custodian of this ancient school. The text emphasizes that the power of the eye can be developed through self-discipline and that it has the potential to enchant whomever is watching. The author acknowledges the contribution of the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa to the completion of the work.",
  "content": "At that point, Virgilio carried out a facetious probative exercise: Faced with the question on what his name was, such customer answered by mentioning a woman’s name which had not even been verbally suggested (to him by Virgilio), only through the power of thought. Virgilio thereupon woke him up. Moved by his curiosity, Max took to Virgilio a number of his friends, and witnessed similar events on several other occasions. Even I succeeded in experiencing on my own skin the power of this seemingly quiet person who, besides the ability I have just described, had also developed a special sensitivity to energies, to such an extent that he was a capable medical diviner equipped with the talent to retrieve an object concealed inside a room. Where does all of this originate? Having intuitively realized that recourse to such technique might have stretched even beyond what we had been witnesses to, and that this power might be used for the additional purpose of making people feel better, we resolved on becomingVirgilio’s students and intimate associates, to whom he could have confided his secrets. We then realized that, in order to attain such power, what is needed is a disciplined work upon one’s own self, which is also grounded on a series of techniques and exercises encompassing self-control as well as self-development and self-improvement. Virgilio is not, however, the only exponent of such school which we owe our knowledge of the subject to. A contribution to the completion of this work was also made by the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of fascination through the eyes has been recognized since ancient times as a tool for relationships, therapy, and personal growth. The technique requires discipline and self-improvement, and its potential for positive impact should not be underestimated. By mastering one's own body and impulses, an individual can awaken the power to captivate others and contribute to their healing. With conscious attention and a powerful gaze, we can create a world of mystery and enchantment that connects us deeply with one another."
