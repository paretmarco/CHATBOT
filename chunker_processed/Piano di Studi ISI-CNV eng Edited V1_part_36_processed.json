  "title": "How can hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism assist in personal and professional success, and what techniques are taught in the course?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a description of a coaching course that focuses on the power of personal magnetism and quantum thinking. The course covers techniques such as hypno-selling, non-verbal communication, and the use of NLP-3 and Quantum Psi to enhance one's persuasive abilities. It also covers the application of mesmerism and hypnosis for real-life situations, such as better communication and understanding of others and even distant healing. The course is composed of two parts, the first focusing on Enneagram, NLP-3, and non-verbal communication, and the second relating more to hypnotic techniques. The course concludes with the issuance of an international certificate of professional coaching.",
  "content": "On forcibly separating her head from the wall, it went back with a stiffness which seemed to me inimitable by voluntary muscular action.” In our courses we explain these feats. In the future we will even activate a complete course of study in these phenomena. Actually some of these teaching are in the course “train the trainers” It is a discipline that creates effects that are impressive many times not only for the subject but even for the experimenter. In real hypno-mentalism we can have contact mind reading, telepathic effects based on the “psychic atmosphere” we create with the subject, reading people based on physiognomy and other elements, and having the subject reaching hypnotically to the non verbal orders of the operator. The subject has always the eyes open and no trance or post hypnotic suggestion is used. Uses in real life of these skills are in: better understanding people at deeper levels than the verbal one, communicating with the unconscious mind, having reaction to non verbal symbols and intentions. Hypno-magnetism: enhancing magnetic effects with hypnotic elements. Sometimes we can use hypno-magnetism for clairvoyance, or for healing people. Hypno-magnetism is based on mesmerism and is the basis for some strange effects that can even happen at a distance… It is like a subtle force in action that probably can be explained in quantistic terms, everything is interconnected in the universe, and in some way we touch this deeper level. In hypno-magnetism we can have distant influence, distant healing, magnetic healing enhanced by hypnotic techniques, clairvoyance etc..",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the world of hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism is vast and full of potential. Realizing the power of our mind and its potential is key to achieving inner freedom. With courses on offer that focus on everything from the true origins of magnetism to deepening our teaching technology and techniques, it is possible to become a professional operator who is well-equipped to understand the different cultures and traditions of the world. This opens up new knowledge that can help us realize our full physical and intellectual potential, while also allowing us to collaborate and make real-world impacts through distant healing, intuition, and creativity."
