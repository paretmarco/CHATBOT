  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises and techniques presented here can be powerful tools for inducing spiritual sensations, creating ecstasy, increasing magnetism, and healing physical and emotional pain. The use of mirrors, music, magnetism, and non-verbal communication can facilitate deep somnambulism, regression, and past-life exploration. Additionally, the closure of the senses and the 10 plexuses technique are useful for creating a magnetic state, while the human pendulum test can stimulate unconscious answers. Finally, the fluidification technique, the use of magnetic points, and the DI PISA method can help in problem-solving and positive suggestions. With practice and confidence, these techniques can be applied to therapeutic or personal growth contexts."
