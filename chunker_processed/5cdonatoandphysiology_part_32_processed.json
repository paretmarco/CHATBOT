  "title": "What is the physiology and potential of fascination, or hypnotism, in the field of science?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of fascination, particularly its ability to produce suggestions that can compel someone to act at a specific time. The author notes that this phenomenon has both positive and negative aspects, and that it has the potential to revolutionize fields such as medicine and psychology. The final part of the text suggests that hypnotism may offer the key to unlocking new scientific discoveries in the 20th century, and calls on readers to embrace the unknown and work towards new horizons. The text is a fascinating look at the intersection of science and philosophy, and is sure to leave readers pondering the possibilities of the future.",
  "content": "Suggested lethargic sleep repairs the strength of patients. From a philosophical standpoint mesmerism has upset the old psychology and opens before us unknown regions. Assuredly a good many false ideas are mixed up with profitable truths in the melee of too hasty words which abound in hypnotism. I believe there is more chaff than wheat. But the exact sciences have always been engendered from a study of the most absurd theories. Chemistry is the daughter of alchemy which itself originated from the art of Hermes. Astronomy comes from astrology, born of astrolatry. Magic gave birth to physics. A great discovery in the so little explored domain of mesmerism has perhaps in store for us the supreme manifestation of the scientific spirit of the twentieth century. As Victor Hugo wrote in a sublime verse, \"The real is narrow, the possible immense.\" Let us work then without flinching, to remove the limits of the real and to reach the limits of the possible.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while there may be false ideas mixed with truths in the realm of hypnotism, the history of science has shown that great discoveries often come from exploring the most absurd theories. Mesmerism may have upset old psychology, but its potential for repairing the strength of patients and exploring unknown regions of the mind makes it a fascinating subject for further study. The goal of fascination is to bring the subject into a passive consciousness, and with continued research and exploration, we may be able to reach the limits of the possible."
