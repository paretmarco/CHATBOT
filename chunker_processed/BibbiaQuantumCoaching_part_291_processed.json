  "title": "What is the connection between quantum theory and human consciousness in scientific literature and coaching practices?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the connection between quantum theory and consciousness through the perspective of various researchers and scholars. Several articles and papers cover the topic, including \"Quantum Theory and Human Consciousness\" by Hameroff Penrose and \"What does Quantum Theory have to do with Consciousness\" by Menas Kafatos. The last part of the text focuses on the implications of psychological treatment on mind-brain interaction. The authors, Stapp and Schwartz, examine the relationship between cerebral function and the physics of the mind.",
