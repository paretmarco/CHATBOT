  "title": "What is the practice of mirror gazing and what are its benefits in achieving higher consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the use of mirrors as a tool for spiritual development, as practiced in both Western and Tibetan traditions. The last part focuses on the Italian tradition and the four stages of using mirrors to attain greater levels of consciousness. It also mentions the Egyptian tradition, which is linked to the presence of oneself, and the famous Cagliostro who used clear water and a child to answer questions with allegorical pictures. The text emphasizes the importance of staying present and developing a central principle of presence to become aware of different levels of consciousness.",
  "content": "This type of vision, practiced with mirrors, jugs or other tools is also fundamental basis for the work of the Fascinators as it develops a particular energetic sensibility that allows the fascinator to be infallible, because he can operate not only in physical dimension, but also in an energetic dimension not yet fully elucidated by modern science, but no less real in its effects. Here are some notes from the Italian tradition. This tradition is from an ancient origin. In ancient Egypt and Greece, starting around the seventh century BCE, the person initiated of the \"mystery\" cults, were conducted through a serie of passages, one of which was a symbolic death. This symbolic death was the \"death of the self\". It opened the mind of the practitioner to a wider dimension. In working with the mirror this is accomplished by entering deep in the dream and after transcending our physical and astral/emotional state by opening up to an higher dimension where will be at a superior level, where we will see the physical stage and the imagining stage as something \"below\" us. OPUS 1 â€“ Climbing The four Stages Let's see now the different steps of an interesting work with mirrors that will make you more and more aware of different level of consciousness. First step is the physical. We will look at a mirror and we will have various distortions. Second step is called \"fluidic\". Our mind will begin to project in this space, and get glimpses of an higher level of reality Third step is \"etheric\". We will go beyond the dream.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, working with mirrors can be a fundamental practice for developing a particular energetic sensibility and expanding consciousness. The Italian tradition of mirror vision has ancient roots and involves different stages, such as the physical, fluidic, etheric, and cosmic consciousness. Taking the necessary steps, you can develop your level of consciousness, explore different dimensions, and overcome ordinary self. The exercises are simple but require persistence and patience, and they include practices that can help you clean yourself, go from emotion to emotion, find the essence, and achieve ecstasy."
