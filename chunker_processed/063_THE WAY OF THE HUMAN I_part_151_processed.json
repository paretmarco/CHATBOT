  "title": "How to stop identifying with your thoughts and gain multi-dimensional awareness?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the author discusses the concept of Jnana Yoga and its basic principle that you are not your thoughts. They suggest that identifying with a thought can lead to all associated psycho-emotional reactions, creating false conclusions and solutions. The text also mentions Nisargadatta Maharaj, who questioned the name of his next book. The author emphasizes the importance of asking oneself, \"From where does that thought arise?\" and not identifying with thoughts.",
  "content": "The minute you identify with any thought, you have all of the associated psycho-emotional reactions, such as \"I'm afraid,\" and your mind will give you a thousand reasons why you're afraid, or why you should be afraid three weeks from now. Such as, \"What if I lose my job,\" or \"What if the person I'm living with leaves me.\" One of the basic principles of Jnana Yoga is that you are not your thoughts. Please note that the reason or idea you have about why you are afraid comes after the experience has passed. If you try to solve the problem presented like \"I am afraid because I am unloved,\" by getting your spouse to do more \"loving\" things, you are creating a solution to a False conclusion which means the solution must also be False (Volume II). Nisargadatta Maharaj once asked Jean Dunn, who was taping his most recent talk and planning to write a book, \"What is the name of my next book?\" (As if he cared!) She replied, \"Beyond Consciousness.\" He said, \"No, no.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, identifying with our thoughts can lead to unnecessary psycho-emotional reactions that are not always based on reality. Jnana Yoga teaches us that we are not our thoughts, and we should not create solutions based on false conclusions. By practicing multi-dimensional awareness and staying rooted in our true consciousness, we can transcend the limitations of our thinking minds and live more authentically."
