  "title": "How can mastering our emotions lead to a balanced and open-minded approach to life’s challenges?",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on the detrimental effects of emotion on our ability to progress, and the benefits of adopting a more objective outlook. The author emphasizes the importance of avoiding excessive earnestness and emotional responses, arguing that they hinder action rather than aiding it. By stripping every fact of its emotional content, we can learn to focus on objective data and expend the totality of our forces. The text concludes with the idea that reality is emotion-free and that it is only within reality that we can build things. This last part sums up the main concepts covered in the previous text and highlights the importance of overcoming emotional hindrances for productive and efficient action.",
  "content": "When emotion is added to some fact or some thought, in fact, it stirs up in us violent responses which hinder action rather than favouring its explication, exactly the way the gas obstructs the march of the engine whenever it is compressed too much. Acting on the emotions Apart from our mental side, namely, the mind’s incessant chattering, the inward radio broadcasts which we are endlessly forced to endure from it, the other main cause that might prevent us from progressing, therefore, is emotion. Emotion consists in the loss of mental balance. It is a form of inebriation in a true sense of the word. Emotion is a degenerate form of energy. In order to expend the totality of our forces, we must have mastery on ourselves and thus consume the least possible number of emotions. We must realize that emotion, every emotion, distances us from the perception of reality, and that it is only within reality that we need to build things. Reality is emotion-free. It only contains objective data.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to become the master of our actions, it is crucial to control our emotions. Emotions are like a degenerate form of energy that hinders our potential for progress. By reacting to situations externally and avoiding getting overly emotional, we can better perceive reality and bring our creations to fruition. Remembering to move slowly, breathe deeply, and stay objective is the key to achieving success in any endeavor."
