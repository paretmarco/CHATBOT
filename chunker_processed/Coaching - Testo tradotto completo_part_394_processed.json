  "title": "\"How can we use projection and attention strategies in conversations to steer the course?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of \"projection\" described by Sigmund Freud was discussed. It's where we project a mental image of ourselves onto someone else. To control and steer the conversation actively, we have to succeed in projecting the vision we desire to see in our interlocutor's face. In the next 200 tokens, the author elaborates on how we can imagine encountering a specific type of person before a meeting to increase our intended projection during the actual meeting.",
  "content": "We might thus imagine, for example, to meet a very dear friend we are accustomed to confide in, in order for us to subsequently “project” this balsamic image onto our tangible interlocutor. The important aspect is to engage in such projection at the time of our first impact with the human interaction marking the planned meeting. Once we have managed to project our intended image at the beginning of it, our unconscious will later take over and perpetuate the projection automatically.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, projecting a positive image at the beginning of a conversation and using effective strategies to sustain attention can lead to successful interactions. Whether it's with a friend or a potential customer, being intentional and engaging can help achieve the desired outcome. Remember to focus on projecting the intended image and utilize methods like direct eye contact or object display to grab and maintain attention."
