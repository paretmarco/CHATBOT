  "title": "\"How can personality substitution lead to success in business and relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author proposes a technique to improve one's personality and overcome timidness. The technique involves envisioning oneself as a successful and confident individual in different scenarios, taking inspiration from the behaviors and characteristics of admired individuals. However, the author clarifies that this technique is not a way to transform into someone else entirely, but rather to improve one's own personality. Continuous study of other people's characters is necessary to master this practice.",
  "content": "This substitution is accomplished by entering the very being of such other person and acting without being concerned with our own selves any longer. The profitable use of this medium presupposes a constant study of other people's characters, an unceasingly alert psychological excavation carried out with the aim of suddenly snatching the secret mechanism which urges this or that individual into action, when any such person arouses our sense of admiration and our envy, and of penetrating the depths of his characteristic modus operandi. Apart from accomplishing it at a mental level, this personality substitution might even be engaged in for the benefit of our body, by imaging the look, the tone of voice, the bearing of whoever we select to be our model. It should be clearly understood that all this will not succeed in turning a monster into a handsome person, nor a fool into a witty individual. It will, however, be of benefit in changing our personality for the better and, above anything else, in rescuing us from timidity, which is the first causative agent of any failure. The training on how to master this practice must be insisted with for a long period if one wishes it to yield good results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the technique of personality substitution can greatly enhance our personal growth by helping us shed our inhibitions and adopt more desirable traits. This requires constant study of others' characters and creating an ideal composite of physical, intellectual, and moral features. By actively imagining ourselves as this ideal person, we can begin to adopt their characteristics and ultimately lead a more fulfilling life. However, this is a long-term process that requires patience, practice, and persistence."
