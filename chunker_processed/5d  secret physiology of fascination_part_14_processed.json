  "title": "\"What is Dark Point and Troxler Phenomenon? How do they relate to fascination and LATAH behavior?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article discusses the position of physiological rest assumed by the eyes and the Troxler phenomenon, the fading of the stabilized retinal image when the gaze is fixed on an object for too long. The article posits that involuntary movements, like microsaccades and drifts, keep the retinal image in sufficient movement to prevent fading. The text also examines the behavior of Latah, similar to fascination, that is inherent to Malaysian people. This last section explores the elements that facilitate fascination, including intense responses to present elements, obscene/sexual expressions, and natural capacity for imitation.",
  "content": "It may be assumed that in normal vision the normal involuntary movements--the microsaccades and drifts mentioned earlier--keep the retinal image in sufficient movement to prevent the fading, which is essentially an example of sensory adaptation, the tendency for any receptive system to cease responding to a maintained stimulus. We can think that also this effect in in function as people fascinated try to \"fix\" himself on some exernal object. SOME ELEMENT FACILITATING FASCINATION There is a behaviour very similar to fascination called LATAH, that is inherent to malesian people. Some elements of latah are very similaro to the elements facilitationg fascination: 1° Intense answer to present elements accompanied by: A° desire to go near a animated or inanimated object B° Obscene/sexual expressions 2° Excitation without reason, following a word, while at the same time the person can be very heroic in going toward the same being (La rassegna Nazionale pag. 738) 3° Persons showing natural capacity of imitation",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the normal involuntary movements of the eye that prevent sensory adaptation can shed light on the phenomenon of fascination. Similarly, by examining the behavior of latah, we can identify elements that also facilitate fascination, such as intense responses to stimuli, desire to approach objects, and mimicry. By understanding these underlying mechanisms, we can better understand and potentially even regulate the powerful human experience of fascination."
