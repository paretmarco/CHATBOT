  "title": "\"How can traders avoid their self-destruction in a world full of external justifications?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the tendency of successful traders to engage in increasingly risky behavior, ultimately leading to their downfall. They lose sight of their goals and engage in a trance-like state, justifying their failures with external factors. The author also explores how people often make irrational decisions based on physical sensations, such as a manager with gastritis becoming irritable with their secretary. The key takeaway is that taking personal responsibility is essential to avoiding these destructive patterns.",
  "content": "In the same manner, when a manager suffering from gastritis experiences an irritating sensation in his stomach, he might get angry with his secretary and deal with her harshly, without even realizing that the cause of his ill-being is purely physical and cannot be solved by losing his temper with such subordinate and engaging in his consequential censurable treatment of her person. What fundamentally happens is that, around, say, the result of “being unable to succeed”, you have built a series of \"because\", such as “because the others know secrets I am not acquainted with”, whereby you justify the negative operations you have actually undertaken. Other illustrations would be your statement “I lack a sufficient amount of money; had I owned more, I would have bounced up again”, or “I must succeed in finding one particular formula”, etc. If you desire to exit this trance, you must take on responsibilities: Consciously or unconsciously, you remain, at all times, the one who is responsible for your own life. Stop complaining or ascribing to other people the causes of your own mistakes.",
  "last_phrase": "To break free from the negative trance of blaming others and taking responsibility for your own life, it is essential to create a plan, take action, and avoid getting sidetracked. By shifting your focus from what should be to what is and putting in the necessary work, success is possible. Don't fall into the trap of complaining and playing the victim, take charge of your life and empower yourself to achieve your objectives."
