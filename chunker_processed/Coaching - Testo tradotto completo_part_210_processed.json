  "title": "How can one cultivate intuition and overcome shallow judgments to achieve their desires?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text explores the idea of nurturing intuition along with analytical faculties to avoid errors caused by a shallow judgment. It then presents exercise 39, which involves using a light to generate brilliant ideas by asking questions about desires and repeating a phrase. Exercise 40 suggests achieving balance and establishing contact with oneself to tap into unconscious evaluations. The text emphasizes the need to nurture one's relationship with their inner self to gain a deeper understanding of life's answers.",
  "content": "Close your eyes. Wait a short while, and then jot down whatever springs to mind as replies to the said question. Repeat the process if need be. Identify the most brilliant ideas which surface to your minds. As you reach that stage, go again through the process while looking at the light more than once, each time placing back in the light the answers you get to the question. You will arrive at new results, and you will develop some kind of “sequence of phases\", which you will subsequently perfect. An essential facilitating aid is to always nurture the relationship with our own unconscious or deep inward essence. Our individualistic self, consisting as it does of habits, is seldom capable of fully understanding the infinite range of answers which life might provide. It is therefore necessary to open up one's vision and have recourse to intuition, to a higher sense which is not merely grounded on logic, but is rather based on an array of different evaluations which can only be made unconsciously. Exercise 40 – The inner code Be in a state of eurhythmy (balance). Relax deeply, and establish contact with your own selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, enhancing the connection with our inner self can unlock limitless possibilities that our conscious selves may not even comprehend. By practicing the exercise outlined above and allowing intuition to guide us, we can tap into the infinite range of answers that life has to offer and develop a \"sequence of phases\" to perfect our ideas. Remember to always nurture this relationship with our unconscious to achieve balance and clarity."
