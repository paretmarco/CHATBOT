  "title": "Can Hypnotism Alter Sensory Perception and Even Change the Size of Faces?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of fascination and its ability to induce a passive consciousness in subjects. The author describes how fascination primarily acts upon the eyes and how it can alter sensory perceptions, leading to experiences such as the \"big face\" phenomenon. The text also discusses the genuineness of hypnotism, highlighted by several experiments where individuals were brought into a state of loss of consciousness. The author notes that there was no doubt about the reality of the experiments among the witnesses. The last 200 tokens focus on the alteration of sensory perceptions in fascination and its psychological and physiological dimensions. The author notes that the big face phenomenon is a crucial sign of entering a specific state.",
  "content": "That is an unnecessary activity added to the basic condition of just being...just observing. Fascination gets these results using many elements connected to eyes accommodation. Accommodation Accommodation to natural vistas depends in a complicated way on: The dark focus of the individual, The retinal locus The spatial frequency of visible texture, The sharpness of focus needed for the discrimination of object identity, for example, reading a sign. In fascination we observe: - Dark Focus position will be influenced by several conditions, and become nearer the more the individual is excited - Retinal Locus is better on the left on the individual, as vision is different from left to right - When sharpness of focus is increased results are faster ALTERATION IN SENSORY PERCEPTIONS - THE \"BIG FACE\" The apparent size of an object changes with shifts in the distance to which the eye is accommodated. This phenomenon happens in fascination, where the face of the operator become big and can even be a sign of entering a specific state as it is physiological as well psychological as it touches what we call \"dimension\" of an object, that is also a psychological construction.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the complexities of accommodation and sensory perception changes during fascination can enhance our experience of natural vistas and help us navigate potentially dangerous situations. By noting the influences on dark focus, retinal locus, and sharpness of focus, we can better appreciate the Mandelbaum Effect and alter our perceptions in meaningful ways."
