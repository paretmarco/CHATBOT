  "content": "It is important to understand that such an intuitive center or third eye, though already quite present as perceptive centre in man, and recognized by for instance the Indians as ajna chakra, is nevertheless in a state of slumber in most cases. Being in a stage of embryonic development, it has to be fashioned through development and opening itself up in consonance with the appropriate rhythm, which varies from person to person. Our own interpretation is that, essentially speaking, it is as if this physiological point was “occupied”, at least physiologically, by the task of delineating a specific identity and mental constitution, engaged, that is, by the conceptualizations which engross the mind, and by the dualistic vision of the world. It is only when this type of “mental block” is released, that intuition is able to wake up again and be harmoniously reactivated, thereby enabling a correct development of consciousness. In this connection, we can observe the fact the various hypnotic pratices 19 resort to the method of touching that area, due to its capacity of facilitating the task of letting go of oneself and precipitating into a state of hypnosis, as the process is in fact disturbed in that manner. The full reawakening on the part of the third eye is connected to a development of one’s consciousness that is achieved over a period of time, as the consequential fruit of individual effort and working on oneself. The more one progresses in the practice of fascination, the more one can discern a greater sensibility in that area.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing personal magnetism is a gradual process that requires effort and practice. The awakening of the intuitive center or third eye is crucial for the correct development of consciousness and requires the release of mental blocks. Breathing exercises and muscle tension practices are effective tools to improve vitality, concentration, and balance. Personal magnetism is not only about appearance but also about having a particular authority, being courteous, and having self-confidence and firmness of purpose. By developing these skills, one can become more likeable and influential. Ultimately, the cultivation of personal magnetism can enhance various areas of life, including work, study, and relationships."
