  "title": "\"How can increasing your self-prese​ncing help you influence others in conversations?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores methods of influence and their true effects on persuasion. In the last 200 tokens, the topic shifts to increasing one's own presence during conversations, paying attention to body language and psychological validation. By doing so, the author argues that the interlocutor will gradually move to your side, making them eager to conclude the deal. The author emphasizes that one must show active participation and attentiveness during conversations, without interrupting the interlocutor.",
  "content": "What essentially occurs with this method, therefore, is that you “will remember your own selves” in the course of the conversation. A very simple way of actualizing such approach is to lend attention to one specific part of your body, such as your hand. In that manner, you will create something like “psychological validation\", and you will notice your interlocutor gradually moving to your side, with an increasingly favourable disposition to you. This method is very powerful. You will observe how your interlocutor will keep on talking non stop, as he will ultimately feel at ease. At the end, he will be the one eager to conclude the deal. In the course of the conversation generally: When we address a person by speech, we must constantly show ourselves to be duly attentive to the conversation, and we must never interrupt our interlocutor, however prolix he might happen to be. Our mode of listening must be a mode of active participation, one where the eye should play a role of essential importance.",
  "last_phrase": "In any conversation, actively listening and showing genuine interest in your interlocutor can be a powerful tool for building a positive rapport. By lending attention to specific parts of your body, such as your hand, you can create a sense of psychological validation that can help put your interlocutor at ease. Remember, good listeners are sought after more than talkers, and through active participation in a conversation, you just might be the one to lead the way."
