  "title": "What is Hypnosis and How Can it be Used for Self-Improvement and Communication?",
  "first_phrase": "This text analyzes hypnosis and enneagram as tools for self-development and communication at both personal and professional levels. The author dispels the false belief that hypnosis can make people act against their will and explains that it is a natural functioning of the psyche. The text then delves into the enneagram as a psychological typology system that aids understanding of oneself and others and as a communication tool that enables one to enter into an empathetic rapport. The last 200 tokens focus on examples of hypnotic models and methods, including negative orders and how hypnosis can be used to sort out personal problems or remove self-imposed limits.",
  "content": "(Anthony De Mello) “Whatever you want to do, or dream of, start it, audacity has talent, power and magic” (Goethe) EXAMPLES OF HYPNOTIC MODELS AND METHODS – INTRODUCTION TO HYPNOTIC COMMUNICATION Negative orders One of the simplest hypnotic communication models is “negative orders” For example: If I say to you, “don’t think about summer”, you will automatically be forced to think about it in order to understand my statement. Starting with a negation means that the listener does not sense any pressure to act. We often use this negative order model without knowing and we get an undesired reaction. For example: Don’t worry.....Don’t be jealous.......Nothing bad is going to happen. Whoever is listening, in some way, has to interpret the undesired behaviour to be able to understand what has been said to him, and this increases the possibility of this same behaviour happening. Without knowing it, these people hypnotize the subject and end up having undesirable reactions. The same model may be used to get more useful reactions from people, which are found in a trance-like state or not. For example: Don’t be curious to know what I feel about you! Hypnosis can be used both in personal or professional scopes, in fact, it is useful for sorting out problems or eliminating all limits that we program in ourselves. Hypnotism is, therefore, used to stop smoking, lose weight, heal fears, get rid off phobias… etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnotic communication models and methods, such as negative orders and hypnotic inductions, can be useful tools for personal and professional improvement. Self-hypnosis is also a powerful technique that can help resolve everyday problems and increase our abilities. To communicate effectively with our subconscious mind, we should use present tense, simple language, emotional words, concentrate on actions, and be precise in our goals. By practicing relaxation and concentration, we can access the creative right hemisphere of our brain and achieve the desired results. Remember, as Anthony De Mello said, \"Whatever you want to do, or dream of, start it, audacity has talent, power and magic.”"
