  "title": "\"How can we recognize and expand our personal power in life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the expansion of personal power, which is situated within oneself. This understanding leads to the realization of the relativity of all things and the impermanence of everything in the world. The author emphasizes that this concept should be used to act more freely and withstand life's challenges. In the last 200 tokens, the author encourages readers to review their life choices, by facing themselves in the mirror and practicing self-presencing, to discover what truly matters and what is merely a superfluity.",
  "content": "Exercise 22 – Reviewing life Let us cast a look back at our life, but this time as if inverted. Let us become conscious of the fact that choices we had deemed obligatory are in reality choices which were based more on fear and the desire to survive than on a goal to be attained. Exercise 23 – The mirror Let us face a mirror, and merely look at ourselves. Let us see us the way we are, by keeping presence to our body as long as possible. Thereafter, let us lower the eyes. If any thought or idea descends on us, let us lift our eyes and send such thought or idea back to the image in the mirror. We should maintain an extreme degree of self-presencing throughout. Let us further realize that what we are facing ahead of is no more than a projection 37 . The truth is that many things which are deemed indispensable, and for the sake of which one struggles hard, or which are either coveted or cause us to feel regretful for lacking or losing them, are indeed superfluities.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking a step back and reviewing our lives from a different perspective can help us identify choices made out of fear and survival rather than our goals. Looking at ourselves in the mirror with present awareness can help us realize that many things we consider indispensable are actually superfluous, and focusing on them only exhausts us. Let us prioritize our goals and avoid wasting time and energy on futile tasks and external opinions that do not contribute to our success."
