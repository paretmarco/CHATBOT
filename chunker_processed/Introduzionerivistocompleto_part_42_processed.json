  "title": "\"How does self-hypnosis and autosuggestion work to control emotions and mental processes?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus is on understanding SELF-HYPNOSIS and how it can be achieved through autosuggestion and hypnotic techniques. The text elaborates on the theory that the brain is divided into two hemispheres and how the activation of the right hemisphere is required to achieve SELF-HYPNOSIS. It includes a hypnotic induction based on the Erickson model to create a state of profound relaxation, and it emphasizes the importance of visualization and instilling emotions in the visualized goals. The text also clarifies common myths about hypnosis and explains how it can be used to resolve issues like anxiety, tension, stress, and bad habits.",
  "content": "The right hemisphere is the creative one, that of imaginative thought where dreams are developed and musical information is found. Think about musicians and painters, they are all people who have a more developed right hemisphere. The left hemisphere is specialized in rational thought, in logic and in language. These two parts of the brain communicate with each other via the corpus callosum, which mediates messages. SELF-HYPNOSIS and hypnosis, do nothing other than allow the right hemisphere to activate itself. We obviously use the left hemisphere more for everyday tasks and this is an obstacle to the activation of the right one, for the former evaluates and examines information that arrives via our senses, meaning images, sounds and sensations. To reach the right hemisphere, we need to distract the left using verbal commands or other techniques until whatever flows from the right hemisphere is not subjected to judgment. In hypnosis induced by others, the left hemisphere is deactivated by the hypnotist through the use of specific techniques. In SELF-HYPNOSIS, we are responsible for this operation. As you would have realized, we remain the protagonists in this experience, whether we are induced or there is auto-inducement. It is here that the importance of visualization arises: Create a clear image of the things that you want and before anything else, instill it with emotions. Just think that inventors are able to see the object they are inventing before they have even put together the parts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnosis and self-hypnosis techniques can help to activate the creative right hemisphere of the brain, leading to improved mental and physical well-being. To communicate effectively with your unconscious mind, use simple language with emotional words, concentrate on action, and be precise about what you want. Incorporating relaxation techniques and visualizations can also aid in self-discovery and desired changes. The use of metaphors and the Time Line technique can further assist in personal development and problem-solving. By embracing these techniques, you can improve your ability to manage your thoughts and emotions and make your desired reality a magical one."
