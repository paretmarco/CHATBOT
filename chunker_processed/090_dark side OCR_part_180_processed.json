  "title": "\"What is the Role of Amnesia in Coping with Childhood Trauma?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of amnesia and its relation to dissociative disorders and the dark side of the inner child. The previous tokens discuss the use of hypnosis as a therapeutic tool to access and heal traumatic experiences. In the last 200 tokens, the text delves deeper into the different types of amnesia, how they are used as defense mechanisms, and how they are related to the creation of different identities. It also emphasizes the importance of body therapy as a means of accessing and healing trapped emotions and experiences, which we might have unconsciously forgotten.",
  "content": "is used, it surrounds the identity and the reason the coping device was formed is not remembered, (i.e., the trauma). Amnesia is forgetting, and it is a defense. Amnesia developed because the observer did not want the child to remember. If someone comes into therapy and says, \"Hey, I just can't remem- bell,\" she also exhibits symptoms such as stopping her breath and holding her muscles, in order to maintain the forgetting. Amnesia is a defense, a way that the observer helped the child to survive the circumstances in which she grew up. When a client verbalizes, \"I have the worst memory in the world, and I'd like to work on it,\" or, \"I can't remember what happened, but I sense I was sexually molested,\" then the strategy for a therapist is very simple. Have them breathe and look at you. This will access the \"forgotten\" experience. Patterns are held in the body and breath. This is why I suggest that traumatized clients receive some form of body therapy: Rolfing, Bio-Energetics, Feldenkrais, Alexander or massage. Body memories of trauma are buried in the body.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, amnesia is a defense mechanism developed as a coping device to help individuals forget traumatic experiences. To access these \"forgotten\" memories, breathing and body work therapy can be used to help the patterns stored in the body emerge. Ultimately, by focusing on both the physical and psychological components, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their experiences."
