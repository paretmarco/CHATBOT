  "title": "\"How Can Traders Achieve Success by Overcoming Emotions and Avoiding 'Social Hypnosis' in the Financial Markets?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of being present and controlling our impulses in making sound financial decisions. It highlights the repeated mistakes of traders who buy high and sell low, and argues that this behavior is not due to \"foolish human nature\" but rather a lack of presence and dominance of the egotistic self. The author also discusses \"social hypnosis\" and the role it plays in financial bubbles caused by mass behavior. Overall, this text emphasizes the need to be mindful and self-aware in making financial decisions.",
  "content": "Nevertheless, even the mice used for laboratory experiments stop making the same mistakes after a while, and find the right way out of the maze following a few attempts only. The \"foolishness of human nature\" cannot be relied upon as an excuse for the ongoing repetition of negative habits. What happens can in truth be explained on the basis of a lack of presence, and to the dominance exercised by a state in which our egotistic self gets the upper hand, whereupon we switch to a state of fear, of a lack of presence, of a diminished sensory attention, in short, to a state of “hypnosis”. What else might succeed in providing an explanation for the conduct engaged in by traders who endlessly reiterate the same infantile error, each time in exactly the same form, in certain instances for a number of consecutive years? When thousands of people either sell or purchase because “they are all doing that”, this, too, is hypnosis. What are termed BUBBLES in financial jargon are usually the consequential fruit of mass behaviour. They are the effect yielded by \"social hypnosis\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the repetition of negative habits cannot be attributed to the foolishness of human nature but rather to a lack of presence and dominance of our egotistic self leading to a state of hypnosis. The impact of media and mass behavior often results in financial bubbles, refuting the theory of a rational market. Effective traders, however, understand these mechanisms, remain present, and do not let their emotions lower their attention, resulting in better trading decisions."
