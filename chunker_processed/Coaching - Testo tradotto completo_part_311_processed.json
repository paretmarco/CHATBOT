  "title": "\"How can we abolish the \"I\" and become more energetically engaged in our daily lives for success?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author provides practical advice on how to be more energetic and present in our daily lives. He suggests that we should stop feeling sorry for ourselves and instead identify with a more comprehensive global dimension. To achieve this, we need to abolish the first person singular \"I\". This simple linguistic method will help us to \"see ourselves acting\" and change our perception of reality. The author also emphasizes on the importance of clarity and emotional power in achieving success. By following these tips, we can make practical implementation inevitable and achieve our desired goals.",
  "content": "Exercise 51 – Abolishing the first person singular When you identify your own actions, you should abolish the first person singular “I”. One method for achieving that is to emulate Julius Caesar, who made use of the third person singular when referring to his own self. In this manner, you might be able to “see yourselves acting”, instead of merely “acting”. An alternative way, which might actually complement the preceding one, is to resort to using the infinitive verb “to act”, “to do”, rather than the formulas “I am acting”, “I do”. You are going to find that this simple linguistic method changes your perception of reality. Instantaneous mono-ideation It appears to be clear, based on what has been stated up to now, that in our view the best guarantee of success is provided, in the first place, by the clarity and comprehensiveness of our predeterminations, and, secondly, by the emotional power by which we might be able to re-vivify them, thereby making their practical implementation — so to speak — an inevitably pre-destined occurrence.",
  "last_phrase": "By abolishing the first-person singular and embracing a linguistic method such as Julius Caesar did, or even just by using the infinitive verb, we can change our perception of reality. Through a process of general presentification and instantaneous mono-ideation, we can turn our plans into an inevitably pre-destined occurrence, making our day a series of quick and effective actions."
