  "title": "How does dissociation affect traders and their trading activity?",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking text, the author explains the concept of building a series of negative justifications around a failure, rather than taking responsibility for it. The text also touches on the dangers of blaming others for our own mistakes and the importance of putting a plan into action to achieve success. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the need to take responsibility for one's life and avoid the victim mentality. By tracing failures back to ourselves instead of external factors, we can begin the process of self-transformation. This message is especially relevant in today's society, where it is easy to blame external circumstances for our shortcomings.",
  "content": "Do not think of what ought to be, but rather of what is in that precise moment. Put a plan into practice, along with whatever is required in order to accomplish the hoped for result, and then refrain from halting with your thought on anything else. Whoever complains will suffer failure. If you do not do as instructed, you will inevitably risk casting yourself into the role of a usual victim: The victim blames – everyone is guilty of something. By pursuing that attitudinal avenue, the relevant person exempts himself from any responsibility, and eventually reaches the point where he unconsciously says: “My objective is not so important and easy to attain, as it does not truly depend on me; it is therefore important to simply devote myself to live my emotions”. Of, course such a person runs into failure by taking that route. What is needed in order to come out of this trance is not to trace any possible failure to the lack of available capital or bad luck, which is but an element you cannot affect by your personal intervention, but rather to trace it to your own selves. It is only then that you might begin a process of self-transformation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to focus on what is happening in the present moment, put a plan into action with all the necessary resources, and avoid complaining and blaming others for any potential failures. Taking responsibility for our actions and learning from our mistakes can lead to self-transformation. Traders who dissociate to avoid the emotional impact of setbacks may need to seek professional help to overcome this mindset and continue trading effectively.  Remember, success should not be a reason to become complacent or take thoughtless risks, but rather an opportunity to continue improving and striving for greater achievements."
