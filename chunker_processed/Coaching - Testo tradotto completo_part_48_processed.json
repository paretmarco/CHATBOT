  "title": "How can we maintain self-consciousness and avoid self-dispersion for personal success?",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text reflects on the relationship between an individual's essential inward being and their external self. The author points out that the self is born as a defence mechanism to navigate life and offer a sense of certainty but may lose its connection to the individual's global essence over time. Consequently, the individual may lack consciousness of a central point of harmony and face difficulty in carving out their existence. The last 200 tokens describe how several individuals lack consciousness of their central point of harmony and find themselves thrown back to a different goal. They are confused souls at the mercy of a thousand divergent impulses and do not know what they want.",
  "content": "They lack consciousness of a central point of harmony which might grant them the opportunity to steer their own actions ... The attendant result is that, rather than thrusting forward, they constantly find themselves thrown back to some point of departure, to an invariably different goal. This kind of person is lost in self- dispersion. Truly speaking such people are not apathetic. Indeed, in many instances they are very active, and yet they are confused souls at the mercy of a thousand divergent impulses, as if the array of disparate characters making up their personalities alternately sought to overcome each other in an ongoing mutual squabble. Their intimate being is perennially absent, a mere absent-minded and passive spectator of the struggle of which he is the battlefield. These people do not really know what they want. There is no end to the number of people who simply dream up their existence rather than actually carving it out for themselves. Such individuals live in a reality of thoughts which they cannot link to the strength of their actions.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to live a fulfilling life, it is crucial to maintain self-consciousness and presence in ourselves, and adapt with the same speed as a liquid adapting to a vase. By striving to free our essential inward being and forcing the egotistic and fickle self to its mere function of an instrument, we secure the price of freedom and value of life. Let us carve out our existence instead of dreaming it up, and conquer the tragic fight between our inward being and outward self."
