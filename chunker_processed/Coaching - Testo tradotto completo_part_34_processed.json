  "title": "What are the foundations of true success and how can one develop financial intuition and initiative?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the book, the focus was on developing financial intuition and discovering new ways. To further awaken the mind, the author suggests an exercise involving looking at a light and focusing on its last fading trace. In this final part of the book, the author delves into the concept of \"true success,\" emphasizing the importance of individual fulfillment in achieving it. The author explores the idea of \"positive exploitation,\" which involves using our talents and resources fruitfully to achieve our ideals. The metaphor of the tree and its components is used to illustrate the interconnectedness of our being and its impact on our actions.",
  "content": "The Latins used to teach us the following: «Prima charitas incipit ab ego» (“The very first charity begins with oneself”), to wit: We must take care of the others, while paying attention to ourselves as well. We are the only unassailable reality which we are caused to meet in this world. True success is intimately linked to individual fulfilment and to exteriorized actualization in the world of our natural talents. It is thus primarily a personal success, while it is a social goal only in a subordinate sense. What we mean by «success», therefore, is the art of bettering and multiplying our specific gifts in accordance with our ideals, as well as the art of knowing how to utilize them fruitfully in every possible way. “Positive exploitation” has both an economic and an existential signification. Going back to the metaphor of the tree and the fruit it yields, if we use fruit as an image for one’s actions, then the trunk is represented by our being which ought to allow energy to flow, while the root consists in our deep individualized being, which is entrenched in the ground.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, true success is achieved by cultivating and utilizing our unique gifts in accordance with our ideals while maintaining inner satisfaction. By taking care of ourselves and our deep individual being, we can better serve and positively exploit the world around us. Remember, the very first charity begins with oneself, and only by understanding and utilizing our natural talents can we achieve enduring success."
