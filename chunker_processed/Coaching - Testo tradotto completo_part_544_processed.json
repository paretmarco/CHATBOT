  "first_phrase": "This text explores the true way of acting efficiently through presentification and attaining control over one's personality, gradually leading to pure and focused action. It emphasizes the importance of consciousness and presence during actions, rather than personal opinions or emotions. In the last part, the concept of becoming a magnet is introduced, highlighting the notion that the universe provides us with everything we need and it is up to us to attract it.",
  "content": "A useful role might be played to that end by instantaneous mono-ideation and by the mental substitution of personality, in its capacity as an additional hypnotic form which requires no magical practices to be applied, only a dose of perseverance. The ultimate aim of the method is the pure and focused action. We do not have to take the action into ourselves: We need to take it into reality, where instead of an “I do” we might come upon a “doing”. Acting should not be dependent on our personal impressions and emotions. We have to develop presence to the action, as it is through such presence that we might be able to “watch ourselves acting”, and our actions, solidly interconnected as links of one and the same chain, might then be in need of nothing other than the initial impulse for them to be undertaken while in a kind of state where they simply “happen to be carried out”. “Seeing oneself act”, without undesired interferences from either the mental or the emotional sides 4) Part Four: Becoming a Magnet Being a magnet The universe offers us every thing we need. It is up to us to grab it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve pure and focused action, we must develop presence in our actions, where we can \"watch ourselves acting\" without interference from our mental or emotional sides. By becoming a \"magnet\" and being open-minded, we can create our own success and utilize techniques to facilitate the realization of our goals. With perseverance, we can harness the power of instantaneous mono-ideation and mental substitution to achieve our ultimate aim."
