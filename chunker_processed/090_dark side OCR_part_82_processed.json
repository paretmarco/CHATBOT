  "first_phrase": "In the concluding section of this text, the focus is on finding solutions to deal with trances of inner child. The author explains how to address different scenarios, including the fallacy of fairness and futurizing, by intentionally resisting, having, and creating experiences. They emphasize the importance of being aware of the inner child's trance and observing and creating experiences consciously. By doing so, we become the \"observer/creator\" of our experiences. The author concludes that awareness is the key to resolving inner child trances.",
  "content": "Ask the inner child, \"What incident may have hap- pened in the past that you do not know about that caused this projection of past justifications into fu- ture?\" 3. Ask the inner child, \"Are you resisting this knowing and experience?\" 4. Intentionally resist the experience. 5. Intentionally have the experience. 6. Intentionally create the experience and the resistance. 7. Notice you are the observer/creator of the experience. For the Fallacy of Fairness 1. Notice when the inner child is in the fallacy of fairness. 2. Whose (Mom/Dad) value system and feelings (Mom or Dad) did your inner child take on? 3. Be the observer of the Mom/Dad value system that yields particular feelings. 4. See the feelings as coming from Mom/Dad. 5. Create the feelings and voices several times. 6. Notice you are the observer/creator of the experience. Conclusion With all trances of the inner child, the key solvent to the process is awareness. Remember: 1. You (the observer) are in the inner child' s trance. 2. Notice where in your body the inner child is located. 3.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome the inner child's fallacy of fairness and the projection of past justifications into the future, it is essential to bring awareness to your thoughts and emotions. As you ask questions, resist and create experiences intentionally, observe and take responsibility for your inner child's behavior, and notice that you are the creator and observer of the experience. Only then can you break free from the patterns that keep you unknowingly creating the problem again and again."
