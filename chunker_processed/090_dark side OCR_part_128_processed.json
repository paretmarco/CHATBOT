Specifically, we look at \"blocking-out\" as a defense mechanism when faced with uncomfortable situations. The example given is of a sexually abused woman who blocks out her partner during intimate moments.

The Next Step Handling Blocking-out Approach I: 1. Identify. The basic principle is to identify and allow the blocking-out to be there fully. This means to literally invite the phenom- enon to reach its full fruition. In other words, if you're fogging out, don't push through or resist the fog. Rather breathe, and allow the fog to manifest. See the fog com- pletely, its size, shape, color, etc. 2. Expand. Expand the experience of the fog, clouding, blanking, by making it bigger. 3. Differences. Make it different, by moving it around, change its color, shape, size, smell or feeling. 4. Differentiating. Vary its structure.

  "last_phrase": "When dealing with trance states, it is important to acknowledge and embrace the experience fully. By identifying, expanding, and differentiating the trance, it is possible to take control and shift from an automatic response to a self-generated one.
