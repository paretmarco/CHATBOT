  "title": "\"What are the possible pitfalls of lying to ourselves and how can we uncover them?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This final section of the text focuses on the topic of lying to oneself and its pitfalls, with an aim to uncover all lies, regardless of their size. The ancient Raja Yoga system explains the importance of not lying and being honest with oneself in order to avoid pain. The author also provides examples of how lying to oneself leads to creating structures that mask our true selves. In one example, a man sponsoring a workshop admits to lying to himself about a woman, which frees him from feeling victimized. This text offers important insights on the consequences of dishonesty within oneself.",
  "content": "Therein is freedom. An incest survivor from a dysfunctional family experiences chaos. He is driven to create a good Dad inside, who is always there, calm and peaceful. This gives the child' s life meaning and stability, but it robs the individual of understanding. By creating structures (lies) to handle chaos, we lose ourselves: the one who is observing and creating these structures. To give another example of the self- to-self lie, recently I was giving a workshop in the Midwest. The man sponsoring me was complaining about a woman with whom he was involved. He said, \"I can't believe I chose the same type of woman again.\" I said, \"That's because you lied to yourself from the beginning.\" After a moment or two of shock he said, \"You know, you're right. I knew from the beginning what was happening, and lied to myself.\" This freed him immensely, because he could now take responsibility for his actions rather than feeling victimized by her actions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the act of creating structures or lies to handle chaos can help us cope with certain situations, but it robs us of understanding and connection with others. It takes an immense amount of energy to hold back a secret, but by admitting our lies and vulnerabilities, we free ourselves and open up a path to true interconnection and unity with humanity. Therein is freedom."
