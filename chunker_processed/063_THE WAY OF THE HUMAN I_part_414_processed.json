  "title": "What is the Minotaur Complex in Quantum Psychology and its relationship with sexuality, society, and religion?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we saw how Theseus enters the Labyrinth, where he kills the Minotaur and escapes with the help of the thread provided by Adriane. However, upon reaching a small island, he abandons her. Here, Quantum Psychology suggests that the loss of sexuality is the beginning of the end of a relationship. In the last part, we see how Theseus, after abandoning his feminine side, heads for Athens and forgets to change his sails' color, slipping into a trance. His father, seeing the black sails, symbolizing his death and separation, from a mountaintop, indicates the victory of the dark and separating forces.",
  "content": "Men often abandon women who held the rope for them, i.e., women who held them together so that they could succeed. After abandoning this integration they become separate again by abandoning the feminine. Theseus heads for Athens. But because of his killing of his own sexuality becoming separate and abandoning his feminine, he becomes unconscious (amnesic) and forgets to change the black sails to white. In other words, because he has separated and destroyed his sexuality, he goes into a trance. This also means that the evil mission of dividing and separating sexuality from the whole mind has been successful and he is flying black, the color of the \"evil\" separation. The sails are kept black also symbolizing his death (greater separation) and, hence, the black or dark forces have wonâ€”dark being the separating forces, light or white, the revealing forces. His father (Mr. Separateness) sees the black sails on the ship from a mountaintop.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the story of Theseus and the Minotaur serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of separating and abandoning one's feminine aspects, as well as the integration of the body, mind, and spirit. Embracing the wholeness of oneself and recognizing the interconnectedness of all things is essential to achieving a state of unified consciousness, according to Quantum Psychology."
