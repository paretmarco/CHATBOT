  "title": "\"How does interpretive distortion contribute to blocking-out traumatic experiences and lead to abusive relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, it is discussed how the child within can block out certain experiences, particularly those that are painful or traumatic. The article will now delve deeper into this concept, exploring how interpretive distortion plays a role in this phenomenon. When a person is repeatedly exposed to abuse or violence, they may begin to perceive these experiences as pleasurable or loving. Ultimately, this can lead to addictions to abusive relationships and a cycle of perpetuated abuse. The story of a client who endured years of rape at the hands of her husband is shared to illustrate this point.",
  "content": "The child within is attracted to the familiar scene, even though the adult knows better; and the observer sleeps. Interpretive Distortion One example of kinesthetic blocking-out, (See Chapter 13, Sensory Distortion) can occur in an interpretive experience. For example, in cases of child abuse the child might at first experience the abuse painfully. As the experience is repeated again and again, the child might begin to interpret physical or emotional abuse as pleasurable, affectionate or loving. Interpretative distortion consti- tutes a subtle form of kinesthetic blocking-out, not feeling what is there. This interpretation explains an individual' s addictions to emotionally and physically abusive relationships. It is no surprise that children who were sexually abused either abuse others or get abused as adults. The child within assumes that forced sex and abuse are love, affection, or worse yet, the \"way it is.\" I had a client who, for several years of her marriage, was raped by her husband. Her gynecologist asked her if she had been raped, because there was so much vaginal tearing. Although she didn't enjoy the experience, she interpreted it as \"the way it is.\"",
  "last_phrase": "It is crucial to acknowledge interpretive distortion and kinesthetic blocking-out to avoid addiction to emotionally and physically-abusive relationships. Recognizing and questioning our experiences can help us break free from harmful patterns and avoid future trauma."
