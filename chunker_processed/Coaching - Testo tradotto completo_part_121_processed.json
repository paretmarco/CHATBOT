  "title": "\"What is the importance of self-presencing and how can it be attained through exercises like the focal point?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author delves into the importance of acquiring the consciousness of our being and separating our true identity from our external labels. The author guides the reader through an exercise of saying \"I am\" and detaching it from external labels to create a foundation for developing any capacity. The next stage involves transcending linguistic constructs to realize our true essential inward identity, which is characterized by being present to oneself. This state of self-presencing can be attained through exercises of attention and presence. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of creating a mental state that allows us to act rather than react to life's challenges.",
  "content": "This exercise, which is exclusively linguistic in nature, will prepare you for the next stage in which even the linguistic quality of life is going to be transcended, inasmuch as our true essential inward identity is neither verbal nor is a self in the first place, as it is rather a profound being. Being present to our own selves is not a philosophical attitude: It is a practical reality. It consists, in fact, in a mental state which is technically ascertainable, and which is characterized by the establishment of a different relationship with the surrounding reality, with our own selves, and with time. Self-presencing might be attained through a series of exercises which facilitate attention and presence in every single moment of our existence. The average man loves or does not love, makes an effort in life or gives up on the basis of his mental illusions, without becoming aware of the fact that his feelings are linked to extrinsic influences or to the state of health of his physical organs. Too often we have a tendency to react rather than to act, thereby letting ourselves be dragged along by lifeâ€™s torrential stream.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practising exercises like the Reference Point Exercise 16 - The focal point can help us attain self-presencing by cultivating attention and presence in every moment, enabling us to act rather than react and recover our inner power. Let us embrace this practical reality and establish a different relationship with ourselves, our surroundings, and time."
