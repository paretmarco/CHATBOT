  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author provides additional minor stratagems for self-control. The first tactic involves inhaling and exhaling air while mentally repeating specific formulas that emphasize the individual's possession and mastery of the accumulated magnetic force. The second tactic is called presentification, which involves concentrated focus on useful actions and the satisfaction they bring. The final strategy is learning the art of appreciation, which includes pausing to consider the value of pleasure and studying the intensity of sensations rather than subtracting value due to incorrect enjoyment. These tactics aim to limit harmful actions and emotions, allowing individuals to maintain self-control.",
  "content": "2) A second and very effective tactic which might be employed for the sake of self-control is presentification, which consists in a supreme form of attention and an inferior form of mental magic. What happens in this instance is that we successfully witness ourselves carrying out useful actions and concentrating ourselves on them and on the satisfaction they bring about in us. This method is very effective if 1) is accompanied by relaxation, and 2) is implemented persistently. 3) Lastly, a third tactic for limiting those actions the abuse of which might cause harm to accrue to our persons (and which consist for the main part in those actions that are pleasing in nature) is learning the art of appreciation. The natural end-result of habits and abundance is that they bleach the value of whatever grants us pleasure. We should accordingly pause at every moment to consider the value of whatever pleasure we are about to taste, and, even more importantly, we should attentively study the intensity of our sensations, in the process refusing to subtract value from pleasant objects because of our incorrect enjoyment of them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to improve physical efficiency and self-control, it is essential to strengthen our vital and nervous forces. This can be achieved through exercises that promote relaxation and presentification. Additionally, learning the art of appreciation can help us derive the same level of enjoyment from a lower consumption of energy. By developing personal magnetism through these tactics, we can enhance our mental capacity and lead a healthier and more fulfilling life."
