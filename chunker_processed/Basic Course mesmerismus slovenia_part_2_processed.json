Throughout the previous four days, participants learned basic exercises like magnetic passes and mirror exercises, and more complex practices such as regression and heightened reactions. They also explored various techniques for healing, relaxation and letting go of phobias. In the final day, they will learn the Indian Self-Hypnosis technique and practice it with the water technique and the Ball of Light. They will also have an exam to consolidate the knowledge they acquired during the course.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the techniques and exercises discussed in this text offer a comprehensive approach to hypnotherapy, magnetism, and healing. From induction using hypnogenic points and the power of raw gaze to the use of the left eye with a mirror and LaFontaine presence induction, the text covers a wide range of techniques. Additionally, the text provides practical exercises, such as the Demo Salamini with regression and the exercise for leaning and solving back problems with regression. These techniques can help individuals let go of past traumas and phobias, ultimately leading to a new and improved version of yourself."
