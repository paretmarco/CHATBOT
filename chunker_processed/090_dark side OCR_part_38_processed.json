  "content": "This enabled her to emerge from a cloudy night into the open air and sunshine of choice. To de-hypnotize is to awaken to see the you behind the trance. You are not the child within. The child within is a re-created memory of the observer. As mentioned above, the observer automatically recreates child-like states of consciousness from the past, as trance states in the present. It is important to understand the function and role of these trance states, which are used by the time-frozen inner child, and, to appreciate the you behind the inner child.
