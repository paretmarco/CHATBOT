  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the remarkable abilities of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa, a charismatic figure who exuded certainty and commanded attention with his bold ties. Despite his forceful personality, Di Pisa was full of humor and fascinated others with his ability to remove addictions and cure various physical and emotional ailments. His gift for instant healing was so effective that he cured most patients in a single session with a 97% success rate. His parapsychic exploits, including hypnotizing over 250,000 people, were well-known in Italy and showcased on national radio and television. In this section, we explore some of the anecdotes that illustrate his extraordinary abilities as a fascinator, including his ability to create states of fascination in others through a specific study.",
  "content": "If someone was feeling pain somewhere, he would remove it from him. He used to create a state of fascination we have subjected to a specific study. Some of the many anecdotes concerning his abilities as a fascinator are set out in what follows: On one occasion, when he was by the large square of Cordusio in Milan, he held firmly to the sentence uttered by a passer-by who was around 50 years old, and who had said, ‘It is about to rain.’ Looking at him in the eyes, Di Pisa then repeatedly said to him in a firm tone of voice, ‘Open up your umbrella.’ The subject, who had precipitated into a state of confusion, vainly attempted to open it more than once, without realizing that what he was wielding in his hand was only a stick. That went on until, some thirty seconds later, Di Pisa shook him and thereby brought him back to the present time. Again while by the streets during another rainy day, this time in Via Procaccini, he caught sight of a person who was busy walking. This subject casually threw a look behind the transparent glass window of the nearby cafeteria, and felt as if he was electrocuted. Prof. Di Pisa was fond of mentioning the fact that some subjects respond to the power of a look at once, and that he was able to identify them without any delay from their gait as well as other telling details, by virtue of the same sensibility which enabled him to formulate correct diagnoses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the technique of \"Instant Fascination\" developed by Erminio from Pisa offers a revolutionary way to cure physical pains, muscular tensions and other ailments. This method involves fixing the patient with an intense gaze to take them beyond their personal problems and transport them into a state of \"non-thinking\" where the symptom disappears. With a success rate of 97%, this approach offers a potentially life-changing solution. The therapy of the look can free patients from their negative fascination and unleash a spontaneous self-reorganization, offering a new life dimension."
