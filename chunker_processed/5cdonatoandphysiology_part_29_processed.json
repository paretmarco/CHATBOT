  "title": "Is Hypnotism a Viable Tool for Committing Crimes? A Look at Expert Opinions.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the use of hypnotism and its limits in committing crimes. Prior to this, the text describes a scene where a person suffering from toothache goes to the dentist while another person, believing himself to be a dentist, pretends to extract the tooth. The text then argues that hypnotism is disarmed for evil and that a person cannot be hypnotized against their will. It cites Dr. Braid and Dr. Bernheim's works to support this claim. Ultimately, the conclusion is that no one would willingly consent to being hypnotized by a suspicious individual in circumstances favorable to the perpetration of a crime.",
  "content": "As fascination and magnetic somnambulance, it takes its source in trust and cannot exist without voluntary abandon. No one can be fascinated or hypnotized against his will. It is indispensable that the patient should lend himself decidedly to the experiments; otherwise they fail. A man of healthy mind and body can always of his own free will act so as to favor or facilitate or to react against and prevent the influence of a magnetizer. Dr. Braid affirms with reason (Neurhvpnology, page 18) that the hypnotic state can be determined in none of its periods without the consent of the person operated upon. Dr. Bernheim also affirms that no one can be hypnotized against his will if he resists the injunction, and, he adds, sleep depends on the subjectâ€”it is his own faith which causes sleep. These two authors who are authorities in this matter render it unnecessary to cite others. The conclusion of this is easily drawn: No one will ever consent to being hypnotized without witnesses, by a suspicious individual in circumstances favorable to the perpetration of a crime.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of hypnotism relies solely on the voluntary participation of the subject. No one can be hypnotized against their will or made to commit a crime through suggestion. While fears of hypnotism being used for criminal purposes may be exaggerated, it is important to always be cautious and have witnesses present when undergoing hypnotic experiments."
