  "title": "How Can Dissociation from Sensation Affect Your Ability to Experience Unity in Tantric Yoga?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text from Chapter VIII of Quantum Psychology, the importance of developing the ability to contain sensations, especially in the practice of Tantric yoga, is highlighted. Without a container, sensations cannot be intensified and turned into expanded awareness. Dissociation from sensation, labeling it as bad, or not being willing to accept it as it is can lead to a loss of awareness and an inability to experience essence or \"I AM.\" This principle is explained based on the nervous system's automatic labeling process and the need to ground oneself in the biological dimension.",
  "content": "But you cannot do that if you don't have a container, i.e., the body. If you don't have a container to contain your sensation, you cannot build enough charge to explode and go beyond. In other words, if you dissociate from sensation or dribble it out through mushy boundaries whenever the energetic charge increases, you automatically lose it or it dissipates. When this happens, there is no container from which to explode out. You need to be able to have a container (body) and contain and hold sensation without labeling it. ________________ Chapter VIII QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Stories and explanations come out of the resistance to having sensations within a container (the body) and accepting them as they are. The nervous system has an automatic abstracting process. It immediately labels and goes into thoughts and justifications during which you move further and further away from the non-verbal experience. If I am notwilling to contain and have my sensations, then I cannot be grounded in the biological dimension and it would be difficult to walk around in life and experience ESSENCE or I AM.",
  "last_phrase": "To experience the true essence of life, one must learn to contain and hold sensations within the body without attaching labels to them. By accepting them as they are, we ground ourselves in the biological dimension and allow the meeting of the world with our true selves. Without a container, we lose the charge to explode and go beyond. Therefore, it is essential to have a body as a container to be able to explore and understand the true nature of ourselves."
