  "title": "\"What are the exercises for developing concentration, presence and fascinative force?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text provides a series of concentration exercises that aim to help individuals develop their presence, fascinative force, and control over their mind. The exercises range from counting beads on a necklace or beans, to focusing on the movement of a finger or hand, and even to practicing the ability to influence others with the power of gaze. The author notes that performing these exercises well requires sustained concentration and that they can help individuals acquire greater consciousness and separate their emotions from their bodily perception. The text culminates with an exercise for walking while keeping a fixed reference point in oneself.",
  "content": "In the absence of a necklace, you can practice to count, in the manner above described, dried beans, hazelnuts, etc. Exercise 12. Thumbs. Sit, cross your fingers and start shooting right thumb on the left with isochronous. The exercise consists in keep your mind focused on what you are doing without ever diverting it. Gradually prolong the duration of the exercise. Exercise 13. Fists closed. Sit; put closed fists on the table. Then open a finger at a time really slowly, giving attention on the motion of your finger. Open one after the other the fingers of a hand first, then the fingers of the other hand; then the homonymous fingers of both hands: e.g. the two indices, the two medium, the two rings, etc. We repeat again: in this, as in all others, the exercise is not to make the movement indicated, but forcing thought to follow the movement without any interruption whatsoever, in order to train the mind to an increasingly long concentration on a particular subject. Exercise 14. Clapping. Beat the palms against each other rhythmically during an increasingly long time; or counting the number of times. The mind has meanwhile to think only to that movement performed by your hands. Exercise 15. Steps. Walk regularly for five steps, providing you have in your brain the feel that you move forward the right foot, then the left.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises can help improve concentration, focus, and sensory awareness. By practicing these exercises regularly, one can train the mind to concentrate for longer periods and increase sensitivity to their surroundings. These exercises range from counting objects without counting to feeling subliminal sensations and observing auras. By incorporating these exercises into daily life, one can develop their mental and physical abilities and become more attuned to their environment."
