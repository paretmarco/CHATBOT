  "title": "How Can Quantum Psychology Help You Discover Who You Are and Question Your Self-Concepts and Structures?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of multi-dimensional awareness and its ties to Gurdjieffian philosophy. The author acknowledges Gurdjieff's influence on their approach, as well as the universality of certain knowledge regarding consciousness and the discovery of self. The final 200 tokens of the text focus on how to use the concepts and material presented in the trilogy to facilitate the process of discovering \"WHO YOU ARE.\" The text emphasizes the importance of questioning everything we imagine ourselves to be, as the notions and concepts we have about ourselves do not accurately represent our true selves. Alfred Korzybski's quote, \"The idea is not the thing it is referring to,\" underscores this message.",
  "content": "The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out WHO YOU ARE The question is, how can you use the material in this trilogy in a way that you can \"facilitate such a process'?\" To begin with, this trilogy can be considered and used as a de-programming guide. In other words, the two statements by my teacher Nisargadatta Maharaj which underscore this are: I. \"Question everything, do not believe anything.\" 2. \"In order to find out who you are—you must first find out who you are not.\" With this understanding as a major context for the Quantum work and the discovery of WHO YOU ARE, it is important to begin by exploring how you organize the \"you\" you call yourself—and bring into question everything you imagine \"yoursel' to be. The notions that you have about yourself are just that, notions and concepts about who you are, which is not who you are. Alfred Korzybski, the father of General Semantics, would say it this way: \"The idea is not the thing it is referring to.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology helps in the discovery of who you truly are, but this process requires questioning everything you imagine yourself to be. This trilogy can serve as a de-programming guide and a tool to bring into question the concepts and structures by which you define yourself. By questioning the underlying assumptions of your psychological and spiritual practices, you can understand why you may not be achieving the desired results, even after years of trying."
