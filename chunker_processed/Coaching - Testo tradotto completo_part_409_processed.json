  "title": "How can A.I.D.A. and Visualization Help in Organizing and Preparing Meetings?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding 200 tokens, the importance of organization and preparation for successful meetings was discussed. It highlighted the need to introduce yourself professionally and be upfront about the purpose of the visit. Being sincere is always the best policy. In these last 200 tokens, the topic of visualization is introduced. This involves using the art of tele-psychology to prepare for meetings by visualizing them the night before they occur. This aids in anticipating the flow of the meeting and planning for any possible outcomes. This technique requires practice and can become a very powerful tool.",
  "content": "The reason behind my visit is, first of all, to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance ... Might you be so kind as to allow me five minutes now, or do you actually prefer to receive a phone call from me during which we might arrange an appointment?» The answer is going to be as follows: «Please tell me ... what is it all about?». Set yourself in the mental state of one who has already arranged the appointment. Bear in mind that sincerity always pays, whereas deceit and the use of subterfuges will not take you far in any situation whatsoever. Critically re-examine every meeting. You will thereby gain time without increasing your working hours at all, simply by programming matters in a rational and intelligent way. 2. Visualization Having familiarized yourselves as a result of your daily practice and on the strength of a form of hypnotic trial which is no longer unconscious, you shall then be required to devote yourselves, every evening before falling asleep, to the art of tele-psychology or distance influencing, by visualizing the visits or meetings which are going to take place during the next day.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing sincerity and rational planning, you can optimize your meetings and gain valuable time without adding to your workload. Additionally, incorporating visualization techniques can enhance your ability to positively influence and prepare for your upcoming interactions. Remember to focus on your goals and to approach each meeting with a clear understanding of its purpose."
