  "title": "What does it mean to \"act naturally\" and how can one achieve it?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses the idea of \"acting naturally\" and breaking down activity into a series of initial urges, which converge into one direction. This requires adopting a posture of presence, mental rest, and a high level of creativity. The author mentions the Tao Te King, stating \"The real man directs without touching, carries out without doing.\" They emphasize the need to \"act effortlessly\" and to transcend the self, which often strains itself when it acts. Overall, the text encourages readers to focus on meaningful actions, avoiding pointless activity and achieving a state of mental clarity.",
  "content": "Essentially, that would entail perceiving it as being made up of a series of initial urges converging into one direction, each one of which is then succeeded by a period of activity when the conscious part adopts for itself the role of monitoring observer of the good functioning of the human machine that “operates in a natural fashion”. We thus essentially look at ourselves acting. This represents the adoption of a posture of presence, one of mental rest and a high level of creativity, given that the mind is perennially awake and present, and, at the same time, it is not occupied and blocked by chattering and thoughts, which would at such stage only have the effect of diminishing our mental clarity. One can detect here a resemblance with what some people have called “state of flux”, as well as with more elevated levels of the being. The real man Directs without touching Carries out without doing (Tao Te King) One must “act effortlessly”. In this instance, the concept of effort is directed towards the self, which must be transcended and which is in actual fact the one that “strains itself” whenever it acts.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve the quality of \"acting naturally,\" one must be present to their own self, free from the limitations of their egotistic self. It requires effort to transcend the self at times but adopting a posture of presence and mental rest can lead to mental clarity and creativity, allowing us to direct without touching and carry out without doing. The exercises provided in this book aim to accomplish that goal. Remember, to act naturally, the concept of effort is directed towards the self, which must be transcended."
