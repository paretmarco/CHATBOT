  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the importance of originality is highlighted as a method for personal growth and development. To achieve originality, individuals must eliminate limiting habits, connect with their true essential being, and venture into new situations, thoughts, and actions. The big enemy of this method is habit, which allows uncontrolled opinions and hackneyed ideas to enter. The text emphasizes the need to refuse to submit to automatic impulses and aspire for progress. In essence, the text urges individuals to take the road less travelled to reach their desired destination.",
  "content": "The big enemy of this method is habit, that is, passive ideation, the door thrown wide open through which the whole procession of hackneyed ideas, uncontrolled opinions, futile statements, and useless wandering in which most of our days are lost, enter. Be original! This is the one fundamental rule. In order to succeed in being original, the following conditions are indispensable: 1. Eliminating whatever is of no avail, the habits which consume your mental energy and cause you to forever tread the same path out of fear of any new road; 2. Centralizing yourselves, connecting yourselves with that which represents the true essential being, and as such the fountainhead of every potentiality; 3. Once that stage is reached, venturing into new situations, new thoughts, and new actions. That is unfailingly attained provided you refuse to submit to the mindâ€™s automatic impulses, and provided you unfalteringly aspire to progress. If we have to go to a specific place, let us reach it by travelling on a different road.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve originality and growth in our lives, we must eliminate unproductive habits, connect with our essential being, and venture into new situations. By giving preference to what is novel and searching for new experiences, we can unlock our true potential and prolong our lives. Let us strive to break free from the repetition of old ideas and embrace the excitement of the new."
