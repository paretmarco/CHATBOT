  "title": "\"How can you develop your sexual fantasy into an exploration of energy and sensation?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author shares a powerful technique to shift our focus from sexual fantasies to the energy in our body. By focusing on the sensations and feelings as energy rather than labeling them as sexual, we can learn to see our thoughts and feelings in a new light. The author shares their personal experience of being celibate in an ashram and how shifting their attention helped shift their energy. This technique promotes self-awareness and helps reduce judgment toward our experiences.",
  "content": "If your attention goes toward the fantasy, bring it down again, and focus your attention and watch the energy. Continue to watch, with no label called \"sexual energy.\" The purpose of this practice is the same as the others in this series, namely, to shift the habitual focus of our attention on the story, and learn to see our thoughts and feelings as being made of energy. I ask you to take your attention, which is focused on the fantasy, and move it into the feelings themselves and to begin to view feelings 191 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness that you have inside yourself as energy. In this way, there is no reason to resist, deny or judge yourself for your experience. As I mentioned earlier, when I lived in an ashram many of us were celibate. I was a very horny celibate for the first two years. I had a lot of fantasies, and whenever I put my attention on them, I would have bodily reactions. But when I shifted my attention from the fantasy toward the feelings themselves, the energy suddenly started to shift.",
  "last_phrase": "By shifting our focus from the fantasy to the energy within us, we can learn to understand our thoughts and feelings better. Rather than judging ourselves, we can come to view our experience as energy and learn to shift our attention towards it. This practice can be applied to various areas of our life, including our relationship with food. Start by focusing on the delightful sensations rather than the food itself, and begin to plant seeds for a more mindful and intentional relationship with food."
