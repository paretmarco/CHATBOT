  "title": "\"What are the four stages of mirror work and how can it lead to lucid dreaming and cosmic consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we saw the different stages of working with mirrors to increase our awareness of different levels of consciousness: physical, fluidic, etheric and the most high level of cosmic consciousness. In this last part, we will focus on the fourth and last step, where we will be conscious in two worlds at the same time and will gradually increase the duration and intensity of our practice. We will do this by finding a quiet room and staring at ourselves without blinking, while maintaining perfect clarity and avoiding hypnotic sleep. The aim is to develop a central principle of presence, becoming witnesses of ourselves.",
  "content": "We will be conscious in two worlds at the same time. We will understand there is an ourself that looks and it is mirrored, but there is also a further higher self beyond the former two. Fourth and last step is the most high level of cosmic consciousness. Let's begin now in finding a quiet room, and look at yourself without blinking. \"Staring at the image in the glass, after a short time you will see the contours of the face, and the contours of the objects in room. They will almost vanish in a milky cloud that will form quickly. During the first few times, until the eye will be capable of withstanding with absolute certainty the burning and the excitation it is necessary, with a in fact mild effort of will, to return to the initial vision, absolutely clear. You can then indulge in this feeling gradually increasing the duration and intensity. One thing is absolutely essential for one who wants to initiate this practice: never lose consciousness,always keeping an unaltered state, perfect clarity, avoiding to fall into hypnotic sleep. Breathing should be complete and long as much is possible but without doing effort.",
  "last_phrase": "Through these exercises, one can enter into a deeper state of consciousness and eventually attain cosmic consciousness. Starting with basic exercises like observing oneself in the mirror, one can progress to overcome their ordinary self and enter into a higher self. These exercises include using water, air, earth, fire, and magnetic passes and can lead to experiences of painlessness and astral travel. However, caution must be taken not to become lost in the abyss and fall into a dream world. With perseverance and discipline, one can reach a level of consciousness beyond the physical body and connect with the cosmic consciousness."
