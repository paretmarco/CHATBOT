In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of ecstasy and explore techniques like Taurus induction, magnetic ecstasy, and nonverbal therapy to deepen our understanding and expand our practice. We will also learn about various nerve nodes and passes that help equalize the magnetic force. Overall, this section aims to equip us with the knowledge and techniques to induce deep trances and somnambulism, effectively use nonverbal communication and sound to induce a state, and conduct regressions in an \"evocative\" way.",
  "content": "The following: 1 ° Three passes with the thumb, from the top and the middle of the forehead, over the nose and towards the pit of the stomach; 2 ° Three with the index finger, starting from the middle of the eyebrows; 3 ° Three with the medium, starting from the center of the ears. 4. Three with the last two fingers, starting from the jaw. It is always necessary that all these passes are led to the pit of the stomach. Once there, we apply the hand, the fingers stretched out and brought together. EQUALIZATION . How many passes do you have to make to equalize the magnetic force? Exactly nine passes are sufficient, because there are only nine major nerve plexus nodes. . Do we always have to do these nine passes? No. If the ailment is in the lower parts of the body, it is simply necessary to make as many passes as there are major nerve nodes below the site of the evil. For example: If the patient has chest tightness and no headache, five passes are sufficient; does he have a sore throat, it only takes seven, etc. The number of passes is therefore generally determined by the location of the suffering, just as the choice of fingers is indicated by the direction affected. MAGNETIC NERVOUS KNOTS (PLEXUS) What are the nine magnetic nerve nodes? Those are : 1 ° between the eyes. 2 ° Behind the ears and at the eight of the jaw 3. Near the clavicle. (Plexus brachialis.)",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the techniques taught in this training program aim to introduce non-verbal hypnosis and demonstrate its power in inducing emotional reactions. The exercises emphasize the importance of presence, body language, and the use of sounds and gestures in communication. The magnetic passes and gestures, opposite points, and fluidification contribute to the balancing and healing of the individual. Furthermore, the Trabona Method and Modified Akstein Method offer effective ways to achieve self-hypnosis. Practicing these techniques while consistently using positive affirmations and convincing verbal suggestions can lead to remarkable hypnotic success."
