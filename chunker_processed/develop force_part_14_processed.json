  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text delves into the concept of fascination, the ability of captivating people through the eyes. It explores its historical basis and provides practical exercises to develop a fixed, sweetly penetrating, and expressive look. The author details the fields of utilization of fascination, including daily life and relationships, as well as the therapeutic field. The text also introduces some notable personalities like Virgilio T. and Professor Erminio from Pisa, who have been critical in passing on the secrets of this ancient art. Lastly, the text discusses how modern science provides a scientific basis for the therapeutic ability possessed by several healers.",
  "content": "Nevertheless, look might, if and when it is understood, function as a valuable aid to any hypnotic influence, due to the fact that it engenders by itself a suspension of certain critical faculties, and does so in a totally natural manner. Summary of the methods of utilization of the technique 1. In everyday life and in the sphere or relationships: The reason why a certain person makes an impact on us, and seems to us “alive”, lies in the self-confident mastery exuded by a look which seduces, attracts, enchants. Our eye can be educated in this respect and guided to the attainment of those effects. 2. Within the therapeutic field: Since ancient times, healing power has been attributed to the look. Both Hippocrates 10 and Dioscorides 11, as well as Theophrastus 12, forcefully maintain that healing power could be exercised through the look, gestures and specific rituals. Our own master Erminio from Pisa 13, therefore, perpetuated such tradition by causing the instant healing of pains of the muscles and the skeleton, tinnitus, and several other disorders. A theory that might provide justification for such results is the one set out here under: The mind is sometimes caught in the grips of what is usually referred to as «fixed ideas». We keep on thinking the same things, and we let ourselves be constantly chased by the phantom of old thoughts and go round and round the same set of concepts. The charming attraction of the look, therefore, smashes such deeply engrained ideas.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the look is an ancient and fundamental part of human culture, with potential applications in everyday life, therapy, and personal growth. By developing our ability to communicate through our gaze, we can become more magnetic and authoritative individuals, capable of influencing and connecting with others on a deeper level. Whether seeking to heal others or ourselves, or simply to become more confident and charming, the power of the look is a tool worth exploring and utilizing to its fullest potential."
