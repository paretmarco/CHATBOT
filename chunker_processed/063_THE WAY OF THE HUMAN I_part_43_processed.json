  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it help in discovering who you really are?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author emphasizes that Quantum Psychology is not a quick fix or a cure-all, and it is not for everybody. The author discourages some people from taking workshops if it's not appropriate or the wrong time for them. The text also suggests that people develop multi-dimensional awareness as a possible aid in discovering who they really are. It is noted that the \"I\" or false self must be dismantled before certain topics are discussed. Quantum Psychology suggests that people undergo the process without any intention of outcome.",
  "content": "Sometimes \"I\" turn people down because for certain individuals it just is not appropriate or maybe it's the wrong time for them to be doing it. There's no implication that there's a \"higher\" or a \"lower,\" it's just not for everybody. And, of course, there is no guarantee of a certain outcome happening. Actually Quantum Psychology suggests that people do the process without any intention of outcome (see Volume II of Quantum Consciousness, Chapter IV). '#8 will not be discussed until the False Core-False Self is dismantled (see Volume II}. 18 Chapter II At the risk of sounding redundant, I want to emphasize that Quantum Psychology is not for everybody. It is not a quick fix or a cure-all, and there are no guarantees. VOLUME 1: DEVELOPING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS As a possible aid in the discovery of who you are, Quantum Psychology first looks toward the liberation of awareness through the development of multi-dimensional awareness. To paraphrase noted Sufi master Idries Shah, \"You cannot become free until you have volitional choice over where you place your awareness.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology may not be suitable for everyone, and it is not a quick fix solution with no guarantees. However, for those who choose to embark on the journey of developing multi-dimensional awareness, it can serve as a powerful aid in discovering their true selves. The journey begins by gaining volitional control over one's awareness and freeing oneself from the grip of False Core-False Self through an understanding of the eight dimensions of manifestation, starting with the External Dimension."
