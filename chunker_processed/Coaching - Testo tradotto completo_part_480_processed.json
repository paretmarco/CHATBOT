  "title": "\"What is a hypnotic dream and how can it affect traders?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned about the dangers of the \"hypnotic dream\" state that many traders fall into. This state is characterized by a disconnect from reality, where traders project their own expectations onto the market and wait for them to come true. This final part of the text focuses on a related concept, \"projection into the future.\" Traders who engage in this behavior construct a fantasy of a profitable future and use it to interpret the present. They speak in terms of the future tense, imagining a reality that may not come to pass. To achieve success, traders must remain present and focused on the now.",
  "content": "The “projection into the future” A trader does project things into the future whenever he constructs, for his own benefit, a fantasy by which he manages to metabolize a loss by accepting it. In the field of traditional hypnosis, temporal progression (or temporal pseudo-orientation) might be regarded as a variant of the “hypnotic dream”. It is further linked to entertaining a certain belief: “It is a foregone conclusion that I will earn well”, as well as: “It is actually easy to earn, all one has to do is to hang in there firmly”. In this temporal progression, the trader’s mind discerns an imaginary future, on the basis of which he interprets the present. The person who is immersed in a continuous \"temporal progression\" speaks by making use of the future tense: \"The market shall bring about”, “I shall be\", etc.",
  "last_phrase": "To succeed in trading, it's crucial to metabolize the loss by projecting into the future without getting carried away by the fantasy. Traders must accept that markets are unpredictable and losses are inevitable. By accepting this simple truth, one can avoid being swept away by the losses and stay focused on future opportunities."
