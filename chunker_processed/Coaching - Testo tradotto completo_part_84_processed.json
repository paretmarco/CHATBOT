  "title": "What are the benefits of muscular and psychosomatic relaxation for productivity and well-being?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final segment, the focus is on the importance of relaxation for both physical and psychological well-being. The exercise methods discussed include speaking with your diaphragm and walking mindfully. The key message is to relax the muscles which do not serve a useful purpose when studying, listening or even speaking, training the brain to stay alive for a greater attention span and effectiveness. Scientific studies highlight the benefits of relaxation, such as less anxiousness, greater awareness of emotions, and reduction in psychosomatic diseases. Relaxation also helps to eliminate a predominant attention directed onto oneself, and the art of relaxing muscles can be learned from animals and children.",
  "content": "All the scientific studies concur on the following point: To reproduce in the neurons the relaxation associated with a half-asleep condition has the import of “regenerating” both body and brain, mind and muscles. Prof. Clifford Saron from the Center for Mind and Brain at the California University has noticed that, over a number of days, those people who practiced relaxation mentally became ever more rapid, were able to maintain concentration more easily and for longer periods, were less anxious, had greater awareness of their emotions, and knew how to manage them better 22. Prof. Benson, in his book “The Relaxation Response”, shows us how a daily relaxation ranging from ten to fifteen minutes might cause a positive reduction in psychosomatic diseases. The self and tensions Relaxation, both the physical and the psychological types, helps one eliminate the permanent or predominant attention directed onto his own self, which is activated inappropriately due to the fact that such a self is not related by a bond of necessity to anything extrinsic, such as a situation to exploit or an idea to pursue. We must learn from animals and children the art of fully relaxing all those muscles of the body which momentarily have no role to play.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, incorporating relaxation techniques into our daily routine can have significant benefits for both our physical and mental well-being. Scientific studies demonstrate that regular relaxation can lead to improved concentration, reduced anxiety, increased emotional awareness, and better stress management. By learning to fully relax our muscles and eliminate self-directed tension, we can work more efficiently while reducing wasted energy that can lead to psychosomatic diseases. So take a few minutes each day to unwind and recharge your mind and body."
