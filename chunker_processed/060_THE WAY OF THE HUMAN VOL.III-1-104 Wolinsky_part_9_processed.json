  "title": "What is the impact of labeling and perceiving ESSENCE as emptiness on existential pain and crisis?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explains how the mislabeling of ESSENCE, the ground of being, can create a false perception of emptiness or \"existential pain.\" This label is often mistakenly seen as the cause of life's meaninglessness or aloneness, leading to the seeking of meaning through the False Self's attempts to fill the perceived lack. This mislabeling also contributes to the creation of the shadow archetype. In this final section, the author discusses how the false labeling of emptiness onto ESSENCE leads to the perception of ESSENCE as the cause of all problems, including the existential crisis. The author also emphasizes that unlabeled emptiness is an essential quality of ESSENCE and not a problem in itself.",
  "content": "They are placed \"in,\" \"on,\" or hidden within the (mis)perceived emptiness (as in a lack) which, though it is not ESSENCE is perceived as ESSENCE. This makes ESSENCE appear as the repository and the cause for all problems. For this reason, the False Core Driver (the label) and Identities are seen as I or \"me\" and ESSENCE, I AM, the VOID, etc., as \"Not me\" (to be discussed later). The \"existential crisis\" (the emptiness and meaningless of life) is a misnomer. It only describes the (mis)labeling placed by this (mis)perception onto ESSENCE. Simply stated, unlabeled EMPTINESS is spaciousness and an Essential quality of ESSENCE. When this Essential quality is labeled as \"bad,\" like depression, for example, this creates an existential crisis which, in turn, leads to the desire (and problem) of organizing (giving a reason for) the chaos of the shock of the Realization of Separation and the narcissistic wound.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the perception of emptiness and the resulting existential crisis stems from a mislabeling of the essential quality of pure spaciousness within our ESSENCE. This labeling causes us to perceive this quality as a lack or emptiness, which leads to the false identification with our False Core Driver and Identities. By recognizing and releasing these false labels, we can reconnect with our true ESSENCE and move towards a more authentic and fulfilling life."
