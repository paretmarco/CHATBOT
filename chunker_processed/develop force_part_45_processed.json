  "title": "\"What are the exercises to develop presence and concentration?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses various exercises that can improve a person's ability to concentrate and be present. The last 200 tokens focus on specific exercises such as the Needle, Clapping, Steps, Necklace, Finger, Funnel, and Light. These exercises require concentration and focus in order to be performed well. The author emphasizes the importance of developing presence and being \"in things\" rather than living life in our thoughts. The text also highlights the difference between watching attention and seeing attention and how a complete and powerful vision combines both. Additionally, the author provides insights into minimizing trances and an exercise in tracking mentally without discontinuity.",
  "content": "Watching attention focuses on the fovea and is linked to the process of thought and attention to closer elements. Seeing attention is then more global and connected to emotions. A complete and powerful vision combines the Jean Pierre de Giudicelli has taught us this exercise ability to see with that of watching because doing so also connects different brain areas. Exit peripherals Trances We often move eyes in various positions and without realizing it we enter into a trance. The phenomenon has been observed in PNL. The following exercise is useful to minimize this type of \"trance.\" Infinity 1 Here is an exercise that seems easy, but it is very difficult to perform correctly. It is about tracking mentally without discontinuity and for a time growing the mathematical sign for infinity, similar to an 8 lying down. You can do it in the country or in open spaces. Imagine, therefore, seeing this immensely big sign standing out in brightness. You must, starting from any point, follow the continuous curve, without ever removing the eyes of the mind. This simple exercise helps the inter-hemispheric coordination as well as it makes it more difficult to lose your presence at certain times. Infinity 2 Observed a point in front of you and then executed movements as a lying eight (?) with the head, so that your pupils are obliged to perform this movement while always looking the point. Try to be always attentive to the point. This exercise develops attention a lot.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises like those mentioned above can help improve attention, integrate sub-sensorialties and increase sensitivity. These exercises offer practical ways to train coordination between brain hemispheres, maintain body flexibility and develop the basic energy required for higher consciousness. By practicing these exercises regularly, we can build our own reality and gradually awaken our full potential."
