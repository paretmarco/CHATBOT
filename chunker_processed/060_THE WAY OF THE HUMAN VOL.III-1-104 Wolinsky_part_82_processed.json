  "title": "\"What is the 'I AM Exercise' and how does it lead to the 'Not-I-I'?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text outlines exercises to help transcend the observer-observed dyad and access the \"I AM\" state. Before this, the author discusses how we often go blank when asked about the observer behind our experience. The last part includes Exercise #6, which prompts individuals to let go of thoughts, emotions and memories while answering questions about themselves. The questions are designed to lead towards the experience of \"Not-I-I.\" Through this exercise, individuals explore their existence and worthiness without relying on surface-level perceptions.",
  "content": "Without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions, Is this personality always there, does it come and go or neither? 4.
