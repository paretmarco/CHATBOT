  "content": "Dr. Marco Paret Developing your Fascinative Force More Health and Well-Being ISBN13 978-0-935410-28-0 © 2011 – NLP International Ltd Preface “Can we not see that a stronger force is exercised by the human eyes which, through a mere look, almost bring about life or death, cause blood to flow away and come back, wrest away strength and restitute it, and, even more remarkably, corrupt the judgment of human minds?” (Sonnet by Lorenzo de’ Medici, known as “Il Magnifico” 1) Who would not like to prove attractive and to fascinate? To «fascinate» bears the connotation of “producing a spellbinding effect or enchanting through one’s look or speech”. The present book is devoted to the power of the eye and the secrets which are correlated to it. By means of this organ, in fact, astonishing results can be achieved. The influence exercised by man over another member of the species is no doubt the product of a multiplicity of causes, yet no one of those underlying causes is comparable, in terms of its potency, to the one possessed by the look. Our thought, too, is influenced by the look. The very phrase “vision of the world” is traceable back precisely to that reality. After all, even in the most mundane aspects of human life, we are accustomed to judge on the basis of the outward appearance. We create a certain opinion of one person firstly on the basis of his physiognomy and, secondly, on the basis of what dress he is wearing.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the eye is undeniable, and this book by Dr. Marco Paret provides a disciplined method for developing your fascinative force. By training your eyes, you can subjugate the energies possessed by your look and use it to develop your presence, status, prestige, charm, self-caring, charisma, and leadership. Fascination can produce instantaneous hypnosis and confer therapeutic benefits. This ancient art has been kept secret for centuries, but with the guidance provided in this book, you too can acquire the ability to captivate people through your eyes and open new doors in life."
