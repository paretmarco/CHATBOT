  "first_phrase": "This text describes the author's breakthrough moment while working with a woman struggling with alcoholism, realizing that she was spontaneously creating her own trance phenomena. This revelation led the author to recognize that all symptoms presented by clients had at least one Deep Trance Phenomenon associated with them, which held the symptomatology together \"like glue.\" The author's understanding of trance work in therapy and hypnosis was significantly reversed, and the therapeutic session's no-trance state was found to be similar to the Eastern practice of meditation. In the last 200 tokens, the author proposes a new approach to therapy, where by working with a symptomatic trance, the person can quickly pop into a \"therapeutic trance\" and relieve their symptoms.",

In the next few days another reversal took place in my understanding: what was currently being called \"therapeutic trance\" in the hYPflotherapy community was really similar to the no- rance state in which a person's perceptions and observations flow tunobstructed in the Eastern practice of meditatlon. It was not necessary to induce or facilitate trance work in the therapeutic session, since the person arrived with her symptom --- which meant that she arrived witiz the Deep Trance Phenomenon Wit was being used to hold the symptom together. By working with ir the symptomatic trance the person had already created, she would \"pop into\" a no-trance state (currently called \"therapeutic trance\") in which the symptom could be rapidly relieved.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the understanding of trance has evolved beyond its traditional conceptualization, and it has become clear that inducing a trance is not necessary for therapeutic sessions. The symptomatic trance that the client brings to the session can be utilized to effectively address the core issue. By exploring the etiology of trance, a more comprehensive view of the experience of trance can be achieved."
