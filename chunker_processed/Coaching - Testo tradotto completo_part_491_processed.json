  "title": "How can post-hypnotic suggestions and self-sabotage impact your trading activity?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author delves into the concept of post-hypnotic suggestions, specifically those related to overtrading and self-sabotaging. The author advises readers to recognize and free themselves from negative beliefs absorbed from their environment, which may prevent them from succeeding in trading. Self-sabotaging beliefs can arise from childhood experiences or external influence, leading to confusion and a lack of focus on one's goals. The author recommends asserting one's control over life and using self-hypnosis to overcome these negative beliefs. The danger of self-sabotaging beliefs is illustrated with an example from the music industry.",
  "content": "What we define by the use of such term is a series of negative beliefs which have been absorbed from the environment, and which prevent the trader from a gainful pursuit of his activity, due to the fact they generate a number of “confusions” concerning the targeted goal, whereupon the goal ultimately suffers the fate that it is no longer practically pursued. An essential pronouncement you should use as a departure point is to assert the fact that you create your own life, whereas one who is not an achiever will say: “Life just forces itself on me”. The causative agents of self-sabotaging consist in expressions and ways of thinking you have heard from your parents, such as “it is hard to succeed”. Another possibility is that they have passed onto you the thought to the effect that “you do not deserve”, etc. A textbook example one can refer to in this connection is provided by some Rock singers who thought about themselves that they “did not deserve”. When they began to taste success, they started a process of self-destruction caused by consumption of alcohol and drugs.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome self-sabotaging behaviors in trading, it’s important to acknowledge and address the negative beliefs we’ve absorbed from our environment that prevent us from pursuing our goals. As we create our own lives, we must be mindful of how we think and the expressions we use. By breaking the trance of “because” and taking personal responsibility, we can achieve success in our trading activities."
