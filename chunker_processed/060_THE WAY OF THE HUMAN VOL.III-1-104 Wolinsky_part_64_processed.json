  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, Wolinsky explores the concept of the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator that Debra experiences through an age-regressed little girl identity. By separating this identity from her present time body, Wolinsky helps Debra achieve a grasp on her own essence. Wolinsky uses Quantum Psychology Principle to assert that separating False Self identities lead to only Essence. This part of the text builds on the importance of emotional work that was explored in the earlier part of the text.",
  "content": "6263 The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum Psychology Wolinsky:Now, this little girl identity who had to do that, where do you feel her in your body? Debra:My face. Therapeutic Note Here, she is \"acting out\" of an age-regressed little girl Identity. Therefore, that also must be explored because it is her lens through which she sees the world and herself. Wolinsky:I would like for you to take the little girl's face off, here's mom and dad, and take that little girl mask off and put it just over there (separate from her present time body) so we have mom and dad and little girl. How do you feel looking at the triangle here, mom, dad, little girl and can you also experience your own ESSENCE. Debra:Yes. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINICLE: When the False Core Driver—False Self Compensator and Identities are separated then there is only ESSENCE. Wolinsky:Good. So as you look at me and as you feel part of your awareness on your own ESSENCE. Notice that we are separate and simultaneously be aware of your own ESSENCE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, separating the False Core Driver, False Self Compensator, and Identities from our ESSENCE using Quantum Psychology principles can lead to greater self-awareness and a deeper understanding of our relationships with others. Through acknowledging both separation and connection at different levels, we can enrich our experiences and lead more fulfilling lives."
