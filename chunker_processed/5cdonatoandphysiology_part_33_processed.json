  "title": "\"What is mesmerism and how does it challenge traditional psychology while opening new scientific possibilities?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The previous text discussed the fascinating yet controversial world of mesmerism and hypnotism, which has challenged traditional beliefs in psychology. It pointed out the interconnection between seemingly absurd theories and scientific discoveries, suggesting that mesmerism may hold the key to a great scientific breakthrough. The text then proceeds to describe some experiments carried out to demonstrate the power of hypnotism, and the effect it has on the human mind: a fascinating yet disturbing prospect. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the text delves into the physiology of fascination, outlining the goal of bringing the subject into a passive consciousness by acting on the eye as a primary tool. It also touches on the functioning of the mind, how it evaluates perceptions and creates a make-believe world of labels and opinions.",
  "content": "The sticking of a pin into one of the subjects who had been brought down into the audience, by a person present and somewhat cruelly inclined, a blow in the face of eyes open to the light but unconscious, and other experiments were sufficiently convincing that however long the of the medical profession as a most fascinating subject. To the humdrum plodder the idea that one human being by merely looking intently or raising his finger or suggesting an idea, may entirely and completely upset the mental equilibrium of a fellow being and cause him to follow his behests as would a trained spaniel, seems outrageous.. It may be worth while saying that in the minds of more than a dozen persons invited to witness these experiments, including some men of science, there was not the slightest doubt entertained by anyone as to the genuineness of the hypnotizing of the subjects. This hypnotism meant loss of consciousness. Physiology of fascination Goal of fascination is to bring the subject in a passive consciousness. For doing it we act on the eye as a primary tool. When engaged in our thinking and evaluating what is perceived, that is the functioning of mind... the arising of the make-believe world of labels and opinions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination is a powerful tool that can induce a passive consciousness by acting on the eyes' accommodation. Hypnotism, which results in a loss of consciousness, can be used to influence a subject's behavior. Several sensory perceptions, such as the \"big face\" phenomenon, can occur during fascination. In summary, fascination can be a fascinating subject, but it should be used ethically and responsibly."
