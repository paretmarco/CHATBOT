  "first_phrase": "The article explores the psychological challenges that traders face while working in financial markets. The previous section outlined four main psychological challenges that traders face, including temporal distortion, hypnotic regression, sensory distortion, and amnesia. In the last 200 tokens, the article focuses on the role of expectations in trading, highlighting how people's beliefs and experiences form expectations, influencing their trading behavior. The author suggests that traders need to understand how expectations can shape decision-making and take measures to avoid negative outcomes.",
  "content": "Even though the concepts we have set out here above are relevant to other dimensions of life as well, we are going in this context to examine some of these points in greater detail from the visual angle of trading specifically. The hypnotic role played by “Expectations” Expectations play a most important role in respect of whoever takes the decision to work in the financial markets. If a market is starting an upward swing, if it is, in other words, at the initial stage of a bearish trend, the reason why that is so is the fact a larger number of people are buying in the expectation that prices might rise further, in order for them to sell their assets later at a monetary premium. We should always bear in mind that markets represent the sum-total of a myriad of different individual psyches. How do we build expectations, however? People's expectations are grounded on their personal convictions and experiences.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the role of expectations in trading is crucial as they are shaped by personal convictions and experiences. By acknowledging the variety of individual psyches involved, we can better navigate the markets and make informed decisions. Remember that our perception of the world is unique, and we apply assumptions and generalizations that may narrow reality."
