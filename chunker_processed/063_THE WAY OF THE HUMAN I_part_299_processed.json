  "title": "Does shifting your focus from sexual fantasy to energy enhance pleasure?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of shifting focus from sexual fantasies to the energy itself, and finding satisfaction within. The author shares personal experiences of celibacy and how it shifted their habitual patterns of sexuality. They delve into the Vijnana Bhairava and its teachings on how the delightful sensations we feel come from within. The key is to focus on the energy of the experience rather than the fantasy. Babaji emphasizes that there is only one chakra, and that is energy.",
  "content": "To paraphrase the Vijnana Bhairava, from the mere remembrance of what it's like to be touching, pressing, kissing and holding, certain delightful sensations arise inside of you; since there's nobody there they come from you. This seemed very profound to me at the time, that the sensations are coming from inside of me because there's no one there. In other words, if you're fantasizing, and you have the remembrance of those types of things, it brings about such feelings in your body. Since there's nobody there these feelings are coming from inside of you. Therefore, rather than focusing on the fantasy and trying to fulfill it by looking outside of yourself, begin to shift your attention. This simply means moving your 190 Chapter VIII attention off of the fantasy and into the experience itself as energy, rather than seeing it as sexual energy and something to work with. It's energy, it's not good or bad, wrong right, high or lowâ€”it's simply energy. I remember saying to Baba Prakashananda that I was having problems with my second chakra. Babaji said, \"Only one chakra: energy.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, rather than seeking external fulfillment, focus on harnessing the energy within yourself through Tantric meditation. By redirecting your attention towards your experiences as energy, without labeling them as good or bad, you can connect with your humanness and deepen your self-awareness. To practice, close your eyes and focus on your breath, allowing yourself to become present in the moment."
