  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the importance and power of the eye in various contexts were discussed. Now, the focus shifts to exercises that help develop the \"Fascinative Force.\" It is imperative to understand that this force is more than just a physical power of the eye. The exercises aim to develop control over one's body, impulses, emotions, desires, and the mental plane in a conscious manner. Through self-training, one can acquire a fixed, penetrating, and expressive look that encompasses both the totality and the detailed particulars. The practical benefits of this training are manifold, and it can aid in inducing a \"hypnotic trance\" in a natural way, developing a specific form of instant hypnosis, and achieving greater \"presence.\"",
  "content": "Finally, as far as the level at which the eye operates is concerned, the Kabbalists are of the view that it acts on an ethereal plane, “the universally shared book, where all the instances of man’s conduct are recorded in writing, namely, the ether. In it, all the units of human behaviour are inscribed, including the look of the eyes, or whatever nice or evil is said” 20. It is odd that this theory antedates the more recent one of Rupert Sheldrake (1998-1999-2000) that concerns “morphic fields”, i.e. the theory of resonance fields which are not directly perceptible but which have a tendency to “thrust” forms into a particular direction 21. In terms of an ancient Egyptian legend, the sun and the moon were the eyes of a large divinity, Hor-jerti, i.e. “Horus of the two eyes”. This pair of eyes is similarly linked to two snakes as part of a tradition reminiscent of the Indian tradition which is included in the kundalini, and in accordance with which ida and pingala are the names of the two lateral channels around the sushunna. This tradition about the two lateral parts of the body sill goes on even in the fascination school of Virgilio T., as it confers special importance on the two hemispheres. Exercises to develop the \"Fascinative Force\" Since the eye is critical to fascinate, the development of ocular’s power is important. Nevertheless, the physicality of this organ is only a part of the whole.",
  "last_phrase": "To develop personal magnetism, it is essential to cultivate vitality, balance, concentration, self-confidence, and firmness of purpose. Breathing exercises and muscle tension exercises, such as muscle fixity, can assist in increasing physical and energetic well-being, while blink exercises can help to enhance focus and attention. By practicing these exercises consistently, it is possible to awaken and strengthen different parts of oneself, and ultimately develop a powerful and captivating presence that can truly fascinate those around us."
