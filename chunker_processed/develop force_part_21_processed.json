  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of the eye and its role in various aspects of human life, including healing and hypnotism. The last 200 tokens focus on the importance of developing the \"fascinative force\" through a specific training of the eyes, which can lead to greater presence and magnetic personality. The text also discusses the significance of the third eye or ajna chakra, which is said to be in a state of slumber in most people but can be awakened through individual effort and working on oneself. The text references various traditions and concepts, including the Indian ajna chakra, the triangle as a symbol of fire, and the Kabbalistic view of the eye operating on an ethereal plane.",
  "content": "Finally, as far as the level at which the eye operates is concerned, the Kabbalists are of the view that it acts on an ethereal plane, “the universally shared book, where all the instances of man’s conduct are recorded in writing, namely, the ether. In it, all the units of human behaviour are inscribed, including the look of the eyes, or whatever nice or evil is said” 20. It is odd that this theory antedates the more recent one of Rupert Sheldrake (1998-1999-2000) that concerns “morphic fields”, i.e. the theory of resonance fields which are not directly perceptible but which have a tendency to “thrust” forms into a particular direction 21. In terms of an ancient Egyptian legend, the sun and the moon were the eyes of a large divinity, Hor-jerti, i.e. “Horus of the two eyes”. This pair of eyes is similarly linked to two snakes as part of a tradition reminiscent of the Indian tradition which is included in the kundalini, and in accordance with which ida and pingala are the names of the two lateral channels around the sushunna. This tradition about the two lateral parts of the body sill goes on even in the fascination school of Virgilio T., as it confers special importance on the two hemispheres. Exercises to develop the \"Fascinative Force\" Since the eye is critical to fascinate, the development of ocular’s power is important. Nevertheless, the physicality of this organ is only a part of the whole.",
  "last_phrase": "To enhance one's personal magnetism, it is important to focus on both physical and mental practices. Breathing exercises can improve body oxygenation and provide positive health benefits. Muscle tension exercises can stimulate the brain and create mental tension, while muscle fixity exercises can increase concentration and attention. Attention is a crucial feature in developing mental abilities and practicing hypnosis. Practicing exercises that involve controlling the blink can gradually increase focus and attention span. Through consistent practice of these techniques, one can develop a strong and charismatic presence."
