  "title": "How Can Hypnosis be Achieved Without Words and Through Multisensory Induction?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the possibility of hypnotizing without the use of meaningful words and instead utilizing nonverbal cues. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the logic behind hypnotic inductions, such as those of Ericksonian and Elman-like styles. The text also introduces NLP 3, which focuses on learning to be a Neurolinguistic Programmer rather than solely doing Neurolinguistic Programming. It aids in integrating NLP techniques into everyday communication contexts for sales, relationships, therapy, and personal development. The multisensory method of hypnosis is likened to the techniques used to hypnotize animals through nonverbal cues.",
  "content": "When we are able to express without words phrases such \"sleep\", \"relax\", \"is not important that your conscious mind hear, the important is that your subconsciuous mind understand\" or \"is important that you have a sincere subconscious movement\" or other, we come surely to a better understanding of what hypnosis really is. It is fundamental to be able to understand what is the logic standing behind the words of the ericksonian inductions, or of the \"Elmanlike\" induction or any other possible induction. Using certain gestures (non verbal communication), we can put animals in a trance. The principle behind is valid for human persons, too. Normally, to hypnotize animals, we have to catch and block them, and after we use passes, or gaze, to hold their attention in a certain direction. For instance, to hypnotize a chicken, we have to force the hen's head flat to the ground, and to draw a line directly out from its beak. The animal will stay staring at this line; to hypnotize a guinea pig we have to roll the animal over and over some time on the table, and then lay it on its back. And the guinea pig will remain quiescent. We can suppose that these way of acting break some of the normal schemas of reacting of these animals and in some way suggest them to mantain their position without moving. There are strong analogies with the multisensory method of hypnosis.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, multisensory induction is an ancient form of hypnosis that involves the use of non-verbal communication to induce a trance state. It is a powerful technique that can be used to emotionally involve clients, change their schema of seeing things and give non-verbal suggestions. With the right feedback and elements of feedback, this technique can help achieve incredible therapeutic results in a short amount of time. Additionally, it has broad applicability in other fields, such as in selling and changing submodalities of internal representations. Dr. Marco Paret, an experienced hypnotherapist with extensive knowledge of linguistics and non-verbal communication, is an expert in multisensory induction and has developed a new paradigm of advanced Neuro-Linguistic Programming."
