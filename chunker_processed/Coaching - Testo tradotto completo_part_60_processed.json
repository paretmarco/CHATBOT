  "title": "Why is self-mastery essential for achieving success in life and how can one achieve it?",
  "first_phrase": "This article focuses on the importance of self-mastery and how our minds have a tendency to get stuck in the same \"comfort zone,\" repeating earlier patterns even when they are no longer useful. The author explains that in order to achieve results in life, it is necessary to gradually attain self-mastery, much like developing a muscle. The text suggests that being the master of oneself entails recovering our true selves and setting clear, useful goals while avoiding aimless reactions. The final 200 tokens advise introducing a \"conscious silence\" between questions and answers as a useful stratagem.",
  "content": "Doing so step by step is simpler. It is like developing a muscle, as recently proven by a number of researches (See, for instance, those of Prof. Mark Muraven from Albany University 11). Being the master of yourself, however, in no way entails that you should abandon your own personality. It is quite the reverse. What it means is to recover what we truly are. Our personality as forged by deranged thoughts is a false personality, since it operates outside our control. By relinquishing the thoughts that are left uncontrolled, we recover our true self, which would otherwise be drowned by the wasteful slag of worries and anxieties 12. Do not let your thinking, therefore, roam about in the bleak regions of vacuous and incoherent fantasizing shorn of any beginning or final goal. Make sure that you set yourself a target, whether in dealing with your own selves or with other people. Do not say anything other than what you have in mind to utter and which is truly useful or indispensable to verbalize. Avoid reacting aimlessly. A useful stratagem might consist in introducing a “conscious silence” between a question and the answer thereto.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by taking control of our thoughts and actions, we can recover our true selves and project a confident and coordinated image to those around us. Setting clear targets for ourselves and implementing a conscious silence during conversations can be useful tools in achieving this goal. Remember, like developing a muscle, mastering ourselves is a step-by-step process that takes time and effort but is ultimately rewarding."
