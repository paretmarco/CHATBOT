  "title": "How to Develop a Powerful Staring Technique for Energy Transmissions and Hypnotic Sessions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains the importance of practicing and strengthening our ability to stare without blinking and internal chatter. The readers are encouraged to undertake the practice seriously for optimal results. The author also provides a free course available on their site for this kind of training. Moving on to the last portion of the text, the author introduces the concept of central gaze, the most well-known hypnotic gaze, where one looks steadily at the centre of eyebrows or Ajna Chakra. Through this gaze, one can transmit their energy or lifeforce to another person, making it the basis for many energetic transmissions and esoteric initiations. The author cites Virgilio and Donato as examples of individuals who have mastered this practice, implying the significance of central gaze.",
  "content": "On a more subtle level, staring is a way to open a channel to transmit your energy. This energy is what is called \"lifeforce\". It is what the indians calls \"the kundalini-power\" and the greeks \"the power of the hermetic caducy\". Even if everybody already possesses a part of this energy and you can get good results from the begin, proper practice is useful to release more and reach the results of Virgilio or Donato. - Developing our central gaze: going beyond the centre of personality As your eyes become stronger, the next step is practising what is called \"the central gaze\". This is the most known of all hypnotic gazes. You look steadily at the centre of eyebrows, at what the Indians call the Ajna Chakra. Your partner will not understand in which eye you are looking at, and at the same time he/she feels the gaze as a sort of power exerted towards him. This gaze has a powerful impact and it will transmit the idea of force and strength. This kind of staring is also the basis for many energetic transmissions and esoteric initiations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practising different types of staring techniques can lead to significant results in transmitting energy and exerting power. Developing the central gaze and looking at the glands are both methods that can help dissociate from everyday reality and enhance hypnotic sessions or important speeches. With proper practice, you too can achieve the impressive results of Virgilio or Donato."
