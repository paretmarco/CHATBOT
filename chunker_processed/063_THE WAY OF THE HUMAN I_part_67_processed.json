  "title": "How do False Cores hinder the healing process and why is it important to focus on them?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author talks about how people with False Cores try to heal their narcissistic wound through compensation, rather than facing and feeling their shock. Different False Core Compensators, including dissociation, spiritualization, feelings of inadequacy, or powerlessness and denial, provide a context for the ideas discussed. Unfortunately, the coping mechanisms often used are more false than the False Core itself. The implications of these False Cores and their attempts at healing are further explained in the text.",
  "content": "If only I were enough, had enough experience, then it wouldn't have happened.\" Another False Core might feel powerless. Oftentimes, the \"I am powerless\" False Cores have a resistance to being powerless, so they oftentimes act overly powerful. They might say, \"Actually I wasn't molested; what happened is I seduced Uncle Henry into molesting me.\" Another False Core might say \"See, I knew there was no love in the world.\" TRYING TO HEAL THE FALSE CORE There are many different ways to attempt to heal the narcissistic wound. Unfortunately, many False Selfs do not try to heal the wound by feeling what is there. Rather they try to heal or overcome the reason for the shockâ€”which is not the shock itself. However, the approach each False Self Compensator takes to heal is more false than the False Core itself. No matter how much the person tries to compensate (for \"I cannot do\") or to be perfect (\"There must be something wrong with me\") deep down they know it's merely a cover or Compensator for the False Core.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, healing the False Self and False Core is a complex process that requires facing and feeling the underlying wounds. Even though the compensators may feel like a cover-up for the False Core, they are not the source of the problem. Only by acknowledging and processing the deep-rooted pain can a person begin to heal and overcome the False Core's power. It's a tough journey, but it's worth it for those who desire true healing and self-awareness."
