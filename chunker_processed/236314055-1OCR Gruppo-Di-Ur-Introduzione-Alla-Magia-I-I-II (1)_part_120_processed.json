  "title": "What is the \"shath\" in mysticism, and why is it important for initiates?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author introduced the concept of mysticism and the importance of the \"inversion of roles\" in achieving valid results. In this final part, the author delves into the technical term \"shath,\" which refers to the moment in Islamic mysticism when the mystic absorbs the divine image and perceives it as the self, while the self becomes the \"other.\" There are specific signs to recognize when this exchange of roles has occurred - as was the case with Ibn Arabi. The author cautions that these esoteric truths should be kept secret, as they can be dangerous for the average believer. The text concludes with a reference to El Hallaj, a prominent master of Islamic mysticism, whose negligence of this precept may have led to his downfall.",
  "content": "Sembra che la fine di El Hallaj, il quale viene tuttavia considerato come uno dei principali maestri dellâ€™Islamismo esoterico (sufismo), sia dovuta alla trascuranza di tale precetto. philolaos@inmail24.com",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the story of El Hallaj, although tragic, serves as a reminder for all of us to remain attentive to the laws and customs of different cultures and religions, especially when travelling or living abroad. It is important to respect and honor the beliefs of others to foster peace and understanding."
