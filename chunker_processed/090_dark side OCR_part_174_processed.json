  "title": "How does the identity dream impact development and relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the concept of identity dreams and externalization, which occur during a person's developmental experience. The article highlights how the lack of appropriate feedback and an interpersonal environment can cause a person's identity distortion to become stuck and function autonomously. The author also shares an example of a friend who had an identity dream of speaking at the United Nations, which was linked to childhood trauma. This last part, of 200 tokens, provides a deeper understanding of how externalization manifests in children who develop imaginary playmates that provide them with the necessary affection and love.",
  "content": "The identity dream, acting child-to- child without appropriate feedback interpersonally, might cause depression, anxiety, etc. \"Externalization\" occurs when an individual, during his devel- opment, is denied the particular experience of a safe, loving, supportive environment that would afford him a sense of whole- ness, completion and well-being. To counter or neutralize this deprivation, he creates a dream character who gives him the complete experience required for a greater sense of self. Children that develop imaginary playmates who provide them with appropri- ate levels of love, understanding, and affection demonstrate this phenomenon. Externalization is a process that provides a person with discon- nected experiences that are needed. To repeat the earlier example, while I lived in India, an introverted friend had a recurring identity dream of himself delivering a speech on the state of the World to the United Nations. After chatting with him for a while, I mentioned that nobody had listened to him as a child and he had been abused, hence, his inner child created this United Nations dream. Here, the family was transferred by the inner child onto the United Nations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize the phenomenon of externalization that can occur when one's early environment lacked a sense of safety, love, and support. While creating an internal dream character may provide temporary relief, it's crucial to avoid projecting these needs onto the external world in a compulsive, childlike manner. By understanding and addressing our inner child's needs, we can develop into healthy, fully functioning adults capable of meeting our needs in a mature and fulfilling way."
