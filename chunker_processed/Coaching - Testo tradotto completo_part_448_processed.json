  "first_phrase": "This is the final part of a guide aimed at enabling readers to learn how to use hypnosis to their advantage. In the previous section, the importance of self-discipline and understanding the psychology of the markets for traders was discussed. The last 200 tokens focus on the concept of self-presencing, demystification, and the dangers of letting emotions cloud one's trading decisions. The author stresses the need for clarity of objective and an understanding of the rational laws that govern the markets in order to succeed in trading.",
  "content": "The concept of being present to our own selves, or self-presencing, is thus an essential tool of a trader. By the term self-presencing, we especially mean a particular state of consciousness in which we do not allow ourselves to be \"devoured\" by the external world. In order for us to attain that state, an essential prerequisite consists in learning the art of \"demystification\". Demystifying bears the meaning of being capable of shattering those beliefs and emotions of ours which prevent us from effectively perceiving the world. Many people turn to the realm of trading because they desire to experience strong emotions, and consequently view it as a form of gambling where the chances of winning are high. Although this principle might even be valid, it is also true that, so long as we let ourselves be conditioned by the search for an emotion, we will not be able to allow money to emerge, inasmuch as we would be looking for something different. We would, therefore, lack clarity in our objective.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of self-presencing and demystification are fundamental tools for traders. By avoiding being consumed by external forces, traders can establish clear objectives and avoid being led by emotions. It is important to define objectives before investing money and ensure that behavior aligns with these objectives in order to achieve satisfying results in trading."
