  "first_phrase": "This text describes a series of exercises designed to guide practitioners to a deeper state of consciousness. The first chamber includes exercises involving the elements of air, earth, and fire, while the second chamber involves overcoming the ordinary self and accessing an inner force. The third chamber involves working with mirrors to explore different levels of consciousness and achieve analgesia, while the fourth chamber involves astral projection and clairvoyance. The text ends with the Seven Mirrors Tradition, which involves looking at oneself in a series of mirrors to understand one's deepest needs and attain ecstasy. These exercises are designed to be self-guided and can lead to a greater clarity of concepts and even identity with the cosmic consciousness.",
