  "title": "\"What is the Dark Side of the Inner Child and How Can Awakening Help Overcome it?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of \"The Dark Side of the Inner Child\" by Stephen Wolinsky examine the concept of \"awakening\" and the practical applications of seeing life from a different perspective. This section includes a quote from Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan and also touches on the \"dark side of the inner child\" and how our outdated survival trances can limit our human experience. The book explores inner child psychotherapy and schema-focused cognitive therapy, drawing on the works of psychosynthesis founder Roberto Assagioli, Gestalt therapy founder Fritz Perls, and Transactional Analysis founder Eric Berne.",
