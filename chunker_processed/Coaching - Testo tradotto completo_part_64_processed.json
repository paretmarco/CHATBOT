  "title": "\"How to Improve Your Confidence and Willpower with Simple Exercises?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses exercises that can help develop a person's confidence and determination. The last part begins by emphasizing the importance of relationships and reinforcement in conferring personal strength. The author then introduces two more exercises: one involves gazing at a point between the nose and forehead to stay present and develop an energy sensation, and the other involves imagining throwing arrows without blinking to increase willpower. The author reminds readers to be relaxed and purposeful in their practice and emphasizes the importance of directing the mind towards one's desires. They also suggest that individuals who struggle with spontaneous thoughts may benefit from a specific education.",
  "content": "Such work is alternated by it with a moment where the logical mind is granted some rest: You must look at one point on the wall, and imagine yourself capable of hurling some small arrows toward that point (Please refrain from blinking your eyes). After a short while, you will notice that this exercise helps you increase your will, and that it develops firmness of determination and self-confidence in lifeâ€™s different situations. Be relaxed when you carry out the exercises. Whatever is bereft of a clearly defined purpose is no more than sheer agitation. It is purely tension of no avail. As such, it belongs to the redundant being generated by a state of neglect. Neglect consists in lack of desire or absence of interest in anything. If we truly desire something, we decide to direct our mind towards it. Were such a tenet to be scrupulously adhered to, no further rule would essentially be of any benefit. However, it is hardly likely that an individual, whose wont is to abandon his self to the wave of spontaneous associations of ideas, will be able to restrain himself. He consequently needs a specific education.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by mastering the ability to focus the mind on a specific purpose, we can increase our willpower, determination, and self-confidence. It is crucial to carry out these exercises in a relaxed manner to avoid creating unnecessary tension. Ultimately, our criterion of usefulness should guide our actions and endeavors, leading us towards our intended goals, whether in our professional or personal lives."
