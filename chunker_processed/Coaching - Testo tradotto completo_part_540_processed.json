  "title": "\"How can coordinating our will and having a life plan lead to discovering opportunities?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of coordinating one's will and educating one's ideas to replace impulsive actions with ideo-determined ones. They explain that having a life plan can be helpful in staying present and discovering opportunities provided by life. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains how to use the life plan as a direction to get where one wants to go. They suggest that one can change their plan if circumstances require it and that one can also focus on shorter-term ideals if needed. To draft a plan, one should analyze themselves from various perspectives and consider their place in society and the universe as a whole.",
  "content": "It might even happen that one formulates it in a specific way because his life is now drawing to its end, or because it is compelled by circumstances to convert into something immutable, due for instance to the fact that one's young age makes the future inscrutable or the individual concerned lacks the confidence which is required to apply the method in a total way. When that is the case, the life plan might be provisionally shelved aside, and one's prediction might be limited to developing an ideal for a shorter time span, say, an annual or monthly ideal or even a mere weekly one. On the strength of all or some of these plans which are mutually interrelated, we might, every evening, set about the task of laying down the plan for the next day, or an estimate of our future activity. For us to draft it, we will be called upon, as a first step, to review the elements which we would like to work on, and to analyze ourselves from every possible visual angle, both as isolated individuals and as part and parcel of a social plurality and of the Universe as a whole.",
  "last_phrase": "Creating a life plan may seem daunting but it can be simplified by breaking it down into smaller, more achievable goals. By analyzing ourselves and setting ideals for shorter time frames, such as a day, week, or month, we can progressively work towards our ultimate life plan. Remember that efficient thought is simple thought, make a plan, and take action!"
