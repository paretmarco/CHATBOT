  "title": "What is the difference between Buddhism and Hinduism regarding the concept of individual soul and how does the realization of ESSENCE and VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS affect the understanding of existential pain and the False Self?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous tokens, the text explains Gautama Buddha's realization of transmigration beyond Hindu Yoga. The last 200 tokens dives into the concept of \"ESSENCE\" and \"VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS\" and how they are mistakenly called \"individual soul.\" It then uses the example of ice cubes in a bathtub to illustrate condensed emptiness and how it relates to the characteristics of essence. The text notes that ESSENCE is the last state that has qualities that can be individualized. Furthermore, infants are very close to the essence, and this is why people often feel a sense of ESSENCE when with them.",
  "content": "It could then be said that the ice cubes contain only the characteristics that were contained within that \"piece\" or \"section\" of condensed water (ice). The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS appears as condensed EMPTINESS from the point of view of an \"I\" (which is condensed EMPTINESS too) and is mistakenly called the individual soul. But according to Buddha, \"There is no individual soul which transmigrates (incarnates) from lifetime to lifetime.\" This realization is what differentiates Hinduism from Buddhism. ESSENCE is the last \"state\" that has \"qualities\" that can somehow be termed \"individual.\" As was previously mentioned, an infant might have energetic-genetic proclivity toward a False Core. But infants are fairly \"unconditioned\" and so they are very close to ESSENCE. If you look in the unconditioned eyes of newborn babies, they seem to express a sense of ESSENCE. This is why people coo and ah around babiesâ€”their being in ESSENCE evokes the open heartedness of another's ESSENCE. When the realization of the separation between mother and infant occurs, ESSENCE is blamed and the False Core label is placed upon it (see Volume II).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the realization of ESSENCE as the unconditioned state of being can be mistaken for a False Core, leading to the labeling of emptiness and the pursuit of meaning. However, it is important to understand that this spaciousness contains the essence of individual qualities and that the (mis)labeled experiences become the alleged Archetype known as the shadow, as explored in Chapter 3, \"The Collective Unconsciousness.\""
