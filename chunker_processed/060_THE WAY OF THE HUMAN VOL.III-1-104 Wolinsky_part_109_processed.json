  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Wolinsky and Sylvia discuss various ideas related to sadness and anger. Sylvia explains that Sadness is part of the False Core, and emotions like sadness block out light. Sylvia believes that the absence of light teaches us important lessons. They go on to discuss the concept of \"I\" and the devil archetype associated with anger. In the last 200 tokens of the text, they talk about the nature of consciousness and how it is a product of electro-magnetics. Sylvia experiences total silence, and Wolinsky encourages her to notice the physical eyes that perceive.",
  "content": "Sad is from another time—it blocks out light, light cannot penetrate sadness. Emotions are the absence of light—sadness has lessons. Emotions are the absence of light—sadness has lessons, if that were not true and just a concept, what would your experience be? I feel angry. Tell me an idea you have about anger? Good people never feel it. It is the work of the DEVIL. Therapeutic Note Notice the devil Archetype. Wolinsky:(Laughing) Well, we finally got to the bottom of it. Any other concepts you have about anger? Wolinsky:Prior to these concepts about light, how big was your consciousness? Sylvia:Prior to there is no \"your consciousness.\" Wolinsky:Prior to . . .

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize that our emotions, including sadness and anger, hold lessons for us to learn. As we expand our consciousness and become more aware of the Electro-magnetic mechanisms within ourselves, we can better understand and navigate the illusion of existence and the concept of time."
