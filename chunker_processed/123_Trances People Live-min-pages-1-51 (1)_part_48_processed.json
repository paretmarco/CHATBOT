  "title": "\"How can interruptions and alterations of deep trance states help in therapy for addiction and trauma?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author describes a case of a woman suffering from alcoholism and how interrupting and altering deep trance patterns was critical in helping her overcome her addiction. The therapist facilitated an interruption by asking the client to differentiate various aspects of her negative hallucination which helped her to stop excessive drinking. The text also highlights the importance of clients' participation in some twelve-step program while working in therapy to remove denial and create additional awareness. The therapist used a common Gestalt technique of eye contact to place the client in a self-to-other trance, adding the therapist as a resource in present time. The author further emphasizes that the adult has resources that the traumatized child did not have, as pointed out by Erickson.",
  "content": "An in all, her treatment spanned six months of intensive work. Although many kinds of treatment interventions were used in working with her symptom of alcoholism, the critical one was interrupting and altering the deep trance patterns of negative hallucination and age regression. I should mention that I require clients who are drug- and alcohol-addicted to participate in some twelve-step program while they are also working in therapy. Attending these groups helps to remove denial (amnesia), to create additional awareness of the addictive issues, and, of course, provide a network of support. By asking clients to describe their symptoms while breathing and looking at me, I interrupt the self-to-self trance of the symptom by placing them (via eye contact) in a self-to-other trance with me. This changes the context in which the symptom occurs and adds the therapist as a resource in present time. (This is a common technique in Gestalt therapy and was demonstrated to me in 1975 by Eric Marcus, M.D., and Jack Rosenberg, Ph.D.) Erickson has pointed out that the adult in present time has resources that the traumatized child did not have.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, interrupting and altering deep trance patterns of negative hallucination and age regression is critical in treating alcoholism. Participation in twelve-step programs, combined with therapy, helps create awareness and provide support. Focusing on present-time resources rather than re-experiencing past traumas is the key to therapy success."
