  "title": "\"Why does acting-out of archetypes hinder self-discovery and how does the concept of the witness help us go beyond it?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the fourth chapter of \"The Way of the Human: Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the author explores the concept of the observer and the observed. The observer is not separate from that which is being observed, and they both arise and subside together as one. Going beyond this dyad leads to the discovery of the Witness, who is pure awareness and remains unaffected by the observer-observed experience. This concept of the Witness is explained in detail, with a reference to Nisargadatta Maharaj's view on the self.",
  "content": "2. It appears to create what it observes, though this too is an illusion; the observer imagines it is the source of the thought, experience, etc.' 3. The observer appears to come prior, to be senior to—as if it existed before the observed—that which it is observing, which it does not, the observer arises and subsides with that which it observes. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The observer and the observed are one and they arise and subside together as one piece. THE WITNESS Going beyond the observer-observed dyad leads us to the WITNESS. The WITNESS is the one who is aware of the observer-observed dyad and is unaffected by it. It can be said that the WITNESS is the \"NOT-I-I\" since it does not have an identity but is pure awareness. In other words, it contains awareness of the observer-observed dyad yet remains unaffected by it. It is an \"I\" as pure awareness, being aware of the BIG EMPTINESS and yet remaining unaffected by the observer-observed (experience).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the principle of the observer and the observed being one can lead us to the realization of the Witness, which is pure awareness and unaffected by the observer-observed dyad. Practicing the Not-I-I exercise can be a useful way to experience this breakthrough and achieve a deeper understanding of Quantum Psychology."
