  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the focus is on a guided exercise to cultivate the possibility of the VOID. The exercise involves experiencing the skin boundary as a wall and then turning attention to the emptiness inside it. By \"seeing\" through people and things, we can access the VOID beyond the concept or cover layer. The goal is to experience the VOID living through us rather than living a personal life.",
  "content": "Let the VOID live through you, hear through you, move through you. Whenever you are ready, you can let your eyes open. EXERCISE #9 NOT-I-I Exercise to be Done with a Guide: Cultivating the Possibility of VOID Step I:Experience your skin boundary as a wall. Step II:Experience that there is nothing substantial inside of it. Step III:Now, turn your attention to the EMPTINESS inside the wall of your skin boundary. Go into the NOTHING inside your skin boundary. Step IV:\"See\" the EMPTINESS that the floor is composed of. In other words, it's like tearing off the covering or a layer and seeing behind and/or through people into the VOID. You could do that with the floor so you take the cover off of the floor and experience the VOID that is just underneath it. ________________ Chapter IV Step V:Now, do the same thing with the air. See through the air so that you can see through to the VOID which it is composed of. It is just there but you will have to see through your cover/concept layer and go beyond the concept called \"air.\"",
  "last_phrase": "Congratulations on completing Exercise #9 NOT-I-I, for cultivating the possibility of VOID. Remember to let the VOID live through you, hear through you, and move through you whenever you are ready. Allow yourself to experience the wall of your skin boundary, go into the nothingness inside, and see through the floor and air to experience the VOID. Let go of the concept of \"me\" and \"I\", and notice the skin boundaries as a wall to see through to the VOID of undifferentiated consciousness. Enjoy the feeling of pure awareness and being."
