  "title": "\"What are the exercises that enhance presence and perception?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The final part of this text delves deeper into exercises for expanding one's consciousness and presence. It introduces exercise 54, which involves enumerating one's actions while performing them, to augment both perceptual and conscious awareness. The reader is warned against confusing this exercise with materialization, as it is about concrete facts, not self-reflection. The text highlights how practicing mental control prevents gaps in communication and the possibility of hearing an inner voice. It hints at the idea that we are all connected and can receive messages through these \"voids\".",
  "content": "We can discern the fact that this variety of exercises adds to the usual exercises centred on presence, which have been set out earlier in this book, such a level which prevents one from thinking he can practice “presencing” while in actual fact he is sleeping. Whoever is less present is less dense as well, and his attention “jumps”, without being constantly there. During business negotiations, for instance, a person lacking the ability to exercise mental control will lose himself in his thoughts a thousand times. It follows that, during communication, there are voids inside which one steps. These “voids” are not just “psychological”. There is also a higher dimension to such phenomenon. How many times, for instance, we omit doing something only because a voice inside us tells us not to carry it out? In an identical fashion, it might happen to us that we act simply because we follow an inner voice urging us in that respect. It might be legitimate for us to think that, perhaps, all of us are related to one another and are able to hear some messages in these voids.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, exercises such as \"distance attention\" complement the development of presence in action, preventing one from losing mental control during important negotiations or communication. By being present and focused, one can discover solutions and tap into the higher dimension of reality, where all of us may be interconnected and receive messages. Therefore, practicing presence and attention can not only improve our daily lives but also bring us closer to perceiving the coherence field of reality."
