  "title": "\"How can experiencing emotions as energy lead to a transformation?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes a powerful exercise that allows us to experience our emotions as energy rather than being tied to the narrative that creates them. The text refers to the Spanda Karikas, which describe divine pulsations that can be felt when we turn our attention inwards. By experiencing emotions as energy, we can transmute negative feelings and experience ecstasy instead. The author relates their personal experience of using this technique to transform anger into bliss. The exercise requires practice but becomes second nature over time, akin to learning to swim without thinking about it.",
  "content": "So, rather than trying to get rid of our so-called negative feelings, as most kinds of therapy suggest, we can begin to experience them as energy. You'll be amazed once you've done this a couple of times. When I first did it, I was feeling furious. But when I dropped the story—my mind was popping up reasons—when I really stopped and turned my attention inside, I was in ecstasy in about five seconds. From that point on, I understood experientially how to begin the work of transmuting the energy of emotions or transmuting my experience of them. As you begin to turn your attention in—and it is a practice because you are turning habitual attention around—it will start happening on its own. It's like to learning to play some kind of sport. At first you feel very awkward, but after a while, things start falling into place. When get into a pool, you don't have to think about swimming, you just swim. You don't have to think about holding your breath underwater, you just do it. As you practice, it comes quite spontaneously.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, instead of trying to suppress or eliminate negative emotions, we can learn to transmute their energy through the practice of focusing our attention on the feeling itself. With regular practice, this skill will become more natural and spontaneous, just like any other skill that we learn through repetition. So, let us not be afraid of our emotions, but rather learn to harness their energy for our greater good."
