  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed how to observe and take responsibility for our inner child identity. Now, in the last 200 tokens, we dive into the Dark Side of the Inner Child, where age regression can cause an observer to overlay past-time experiences onto the present. This creates a distorted view of reality, and memories can resurface on their own outside of awareness. Using the example of a little girl molested by Uncle Henry in 1950, we explore how freezing the action of the film and forming protective beliefs can impact one's present reality.",
  "content": "32 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child Age regression is a trance, understood as the basic process during which the observer moves from present time to a frozen picture of a child interacting with an adult in past time. The observer takes that past-time picture and overlays or trance-fers it on top of present time experiences. The observer sees the world through the eyes of the dark side of the inner child by overlaying what is actually occurring. Breaking this habit de-hypnotizes the observer and places the memory (picture) back in linear time. As long as the memory and the inner child are out of control, they will \"pop up\" on their own, outside the awareness of the adult. For example, let's say there is an observer observing a small girl in 1950. The little girl gets molested by Uncle Henry. At the time, the observer cannot understand what is occurring and feels chaos or confusion. In that chaos, the observer \"freezes the action of the film,\" and to protect the (little girl), the observer decides, \"Don't trust men or this will happen again,\" or \"Remember this so it won't happen again.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome the negative impacts of age regression and regain control over your thoughts and emotions, it's important to break the habit of overlaying past experiences onto present situations. By learning to de-hypnotize yourself and placing memories in their proper context, you can prevent the wounded inner child from taking over and affecting your present-day experiences. Remember that while it can be a challenging process, it's possible to heal and move forward with a healthier mindset."
