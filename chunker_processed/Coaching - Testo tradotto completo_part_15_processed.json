  "title": "How can you achieve personal fulfillment by controlling your emotions and directing vital energy?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of the text, the author emphasizes the importance of being active and in control of oneself in order to achieve personal goals. They discuss two directions in which our vital energy might flow: linear goal-setting and living in the present moment. By being present and directing our energy towards our personal ideals, we can avoid being swept along by life's events and attain a position of control. To achieve this, the author encourages spontaneous action and an awareness of our relationship with the Universe. Ultimately, the key to success lies in being present and active in pursuing our goals.",
  "content": "The truth is that, when we are present, synchronicity is brought into being; we might thereupon be able to understand through the medium of signs and circumstances, the exact nature of which is unveiled to us, and our intuition might discern the direction which our ideal should face, and which ideal we ought to head for. If we then clearly resolve upon moving in that direction, we might become capable of avoiding the danger of being swept along by life, by the becoming of events, nay, we might succeed in attaining a position of control over the same. When that takes place, programming turns into a way in which we think about the present better, in so far as it empties the mind of the future; provided that, once the direction for our day has been set, we stay present as much as possible. In that event, the Universe will begin to respond to us and even to help us move further than what our self might have ever imagined. THIRD POINT â€“ Acting Spontaneously In the end analysis, the key is being active.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by being present and aligning ourselves with our essential being, we can create synchronicity in our lives and take control of our actions. By programming our thoughts and actions towards our ultimate goal and acting spontaneously from our true selves, we can guide the Universe to assist us in achieving beyond what we could have ever imagined."
