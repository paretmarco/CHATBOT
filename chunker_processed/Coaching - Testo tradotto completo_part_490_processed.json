  "title": "How can post-hypnotic suggestions impact a trader's success in the market?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author warns traders about the dangers of post-hypnotic suggestions, particularly those that may have been ingrained in one's psyche during childhood. The author advises traders to be aware of and challenge such suggestions in order to avoid self-sabotage and overtrading. The real traders are the ones who gather information and take opportunities, rather than sticking to rigid ways of thinking. The author suggests that self-hypnosis may be a helpful method for freeing oneself from such conditioning. The text also warns about the risk of \"overtrading\" and advises traders to be their own selves.",
  "content": "After the hypnosis has been carried out, for instance, the subject is told that he will not be able to get up from the chair, and the subject does not in fact succeed in rising from it. In the same fashion, in the arena of trading we must come out of the post-hypnotic suggestions which reach us from our childhood, such as \"DO!\". This suggestion exposes one to the risk of being pushed into the phenomenon of â€œovertrading\". What essentially happens here is that the subject does too much and ... loses. Advice 6: Be your own selves If you come to realize the presence of such type of problems, try and free yourselves from them (the self-hypnosis which is set out later in this book might prove to be an excellent method for that purpose). The post-hypnotic suggestion of self-sabotaging An even greater danger is posed by post-hypnotic suggestions of self-sabotaging.",
  "last_phrase": "To become successful traders, it is important to identify and eliminate post-hypnotic suggestions of self-sabotage that may have been ingrained in us from childhood. We must take charge of our own lives and free ourselves from negative beliefs that hold us back. By doing so, we increase our chances of attaining our goals and achieving success in our trading careers. Remember, the power to succeed lies within us."
