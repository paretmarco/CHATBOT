  "title": "What is the difference between the \"Mano Destra\" and the \"Mano Sinistra\" in esotericism, and which path is suitable for the current era?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of esotericism and its two distinct paths: the Right Hand Path and the Left Hand Path. The former involves rules, laws and ritual conformity, while the latter deliberately distances itself from such restrictions to pursue transcendence. The text highlights the relevance of the Left Hand Path in the current era of dissolution and free flow of energies. The author warns against using esoteric tradition as a means of promoting conformism. In the following 200 tokens, the focus is on the figure of Julius Evola, an Italian philosopher whose controversial views on esotericism and traditionalism are explored.",
  "content": "Queste precisazioni non sono inopportune perch√© sap- piamo di ambienti nei quali, sulla base di tesi, come quelle dell'autore accennato, la tradizione in senso eso- terico la si vorrebbe far servire da sanzione per un con- formismo tradizionalistico da scolaretti, pronto a trovar tutto giusto e tutto legittimo.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while some may attempt to use esoteric traditions to justify conformity and intimidate those who do not adhere to strict religious rules, it is important to remember that modern society has evolved from these traditional practices. Therefore, it may not be necessary to strictly follow the rules of exotericism, such as those within the Catholic church, in order to be a qualified candidate for initiation. It is important to consider the context in which these traditions were created and to adapt accordingly in order to find a path that suits one's own spiritual journey."
