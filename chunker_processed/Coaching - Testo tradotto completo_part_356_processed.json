  "title": "\"What is the 'Infinite Watch' Exercise and How Can It Help Achieve Self-Annihilation and Restful Sleep?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the concept of self-annihilation as a means of achieving a recombination of the self. They also spoke about the importance of sleep as a portal to this state, and how to achieve a comfortable position for optimal relaxation. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces Exercise 52 - The Infinite Watch, which involves focusing on a light and performing movements with the head, followed by observing the transformation of the residual luminous forms. This exercise can be done during normal sleep by placing pressure on the forehead with the middle finger of the right hand.",
  "content": "After some thirty seconds, close your eyes, lay the palms of your hands over the eyes, and keep your eyes shut all the way until the image of the residual luminous trace has fully disappeared. During the period when the residual image is going to subsist, do not think about any thing at all. Limit yourselves to exclusively watching the transformation of the luminous forms. After a while you can open your eyes, as the exercise would have drawn to a close. Alternative method We can of course implement the exercise even during normal sleep. If you happen to be lying on your bed, rest the tip of the middle finger of your right hand on your forehead, precisely by the hollow dip which lies slightly above the base of the nose, in the space between your eyelashes. Having done that, exert an energetic and uninterrupted pressure on your skull, without going to any extreme length. You must fall asleep in that very position.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing these exercises can help clear your mind and promote a more peaceful state of being. Whether you opt to watch the transformation of luminous forms or focus your thoughts on the sign of mathematical infinite, taking a few moments to disconnect from the world can be incredibly beneficial. Give it a try and see how it works for you!"
