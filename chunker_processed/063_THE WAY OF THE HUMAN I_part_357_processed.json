  "title": "\"Why is spiritualization trance-ference disempowering in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text, Quantum Psychology principles are discussed in relation to trance-ference and de-hypnosis. The concept of idealization is examined, and this leads to the deeper levels of spiritualization and the god or guru trance. The author argues that the idea of positive trance-ference is a construct of the therapist's counter-trance-ference issues. This section emphasizes the importance of avoiding disempowering trance-ferences and establishing a more productive interpersonal relationship.",
  "content": "SPIRITUALIZATION The deepest form of trance-ference is spiritualization which occurs when the trance-Terence of idealization is solidified and moves to the next step.' In spiritualization, idealization is not resolved. In other words, mom and dad are not seen as human beings but instead are super-idealized and seen as gods, saints, or great teachers. This goes on to create what Quantum Psychology calls the god or guru trance. Once in the early '70s and recently in Norway I knew people who had idealized his guru and kept on telling me how great he wasâ€”certainly much smarter than mine. I said to them, to point out his spiritualized trance, \"My guru can beat up your guru.\" The spiritualization trance-ference is the next step after idealization. discussed this in Chapter 14 of The Dark Side of the Inner Child: the Next Step. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness DE-HYPNOS1S AND COUNTER-TRANCE-FERENCE In Trances People Live, the process discussed is not hypnosis but de-hypnosis. In this case, unlike ego psychology, Quantum Psy- chology does not attempt to set up or create a \"positive trance-ference\" with the client. Quantum Psychology believes that the idea of using trance-ference was constructed by the therapist's own counter-trance- ference issues.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology emphasizes that spiritualization and trance-ference can create dependency and hinder personal growth. Rather than encouraging trance-ference, the focus should be on de-hypnosis and counter-trance-ference to help individuals develop multi-dimensional awareness and overcome unresolved issues."
