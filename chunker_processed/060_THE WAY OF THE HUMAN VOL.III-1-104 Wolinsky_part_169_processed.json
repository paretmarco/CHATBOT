  "title": "How can you process negative and positive reactions to religious symbols?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author presents a meditative exercise for processing negative and positive reactions to religious or spiritual symbols. The purpose is to find the VOID or space prior to the emergence of any symbol and focus on it. By doing so, we can disconnect from the attachment and energy associated with these symbols. The exercise involves allowing different symbols to come to awareness, noticing the energy or feeling attached to them, and finding the VOID from which they arise. The author encourages us to go deeply into that VOID and stay there. This exercise is part of \"The Way of the Human\" and \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" written by the author.",
  "content": "You'll be surprised how much attachment you have, how many good or bad feelings (energy) attached to it. Now, go back into the EMPTINESS from which the symbol arose, to the space prior to the symbol, and focus on that VOID. Practice Now, I'd like you to let an image come to you, of a spiritual or religious symbol. Notice what your positive or negative feelings are about it. Then find the VOID prior to the emergence of that symbol. Now, let another religious symbol come up into your awareness, notice the image, good or bad, and find the VOID from which that symbol came. Now, let another religious symbol come up into your awareness, notice the energy, and find the VOID from which that symbol came. Allow another spiritual symbol to come into your awareness, and again, locate the VOID that symbol came from. And finally, one more religious symbol, notice the energy attached to it, and find the VOID and stay in the space where all religious symbols come from; in fact, stay in the VOID where all symbols come from. Go deeply into that VOID.",
  "last_phrase": "By letting go of our attachments to symbols and tapping into the void from which they arise, we can experience the oneness of consciousness. Try the exercises outlined here to connect with this state of being and find peace within the void."
