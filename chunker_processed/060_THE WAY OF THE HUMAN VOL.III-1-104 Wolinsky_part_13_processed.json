  "title": "\"How can entering the pure 'emptiness' beyond False Core Drivers lead to awareness of the VOID?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This is the last part of Chapter I in \"The Way of the Human\", a conversation between Jill and Wolinsky on the false core driver of \"I am alone\". After exploring the connection between dark emptiness and this label, Wolinsky guides Jill to the primary experience of spaciousness, where she identifies the eternal and infinite nature of her consciousness beyond her finite self. This \"owning\" of her essence and differentiation of dimensions is a crucial step towards transcending the false core driver.",
  "content": "Now, go to the dark, empty space prior to the false conclusion of \"I am alone\" and describe that experience. Jill:It's just quiet, vast, peaceful and it's still. It's very rich and full but in an undefined way. It goes on forever. I mean it's endless. Therapeutic Note If we enter into the pure \"EMPTINESS\" or spaciousness prior to the False Core; ESSENCE, we go beyond the False Core Driver's label and can even pop into the awareness of the VOID itself (see Chapter, The NOT-I-D. Wolinsky:Can you say I go on forever, I'm endless. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter 1 Therapeutic Note Here I want her to \"own\" her ESSENCE and the awareness of the VOID. Jill:I, as consciousness, can go on forever, I'm end- less. Wolinsky:Do you experience that right now? Jill:Yeah, but not as Jill. Wolinsky:Okay. Can you say Jill is finite but I go on for- ever? Therapeutic Note Here we were differentiating the dimensions. Jill (body-mind, etc.)",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and experiencing the emptiness or spaciousness prior to our false core drivers, we can discover our true essence and realize that we are endless. Take a step back, differentiate the dimensions, and trace the steps backward with awareness. You too can go beyond the false conclusion of being alone and find peace in the vastness of your own being."
