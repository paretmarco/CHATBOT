  "first_phrase": "In the preceding part, we learned about the positive and negative trances and their relation to the union of will and imagination. Now we will dive into the importance of mental images as a basis for transmutation and activation of symbols. The text explores the usage of images and symbols for self-improvement, keys to integrating sottosensorialità and developing the abilities and powers of a person. The last part also focuses on mastering polarities through exercises involving breathing and light. Additionally, we learn about the significance of reflected light for retentive memory and the observation of icons and images in the transmutation of man.",
  "content": "It takes time to achieve at maximum degree the ability to shape our mental material as clay, but the results are worth the effort. You will notice an increase in personal influence, and you'll realize that often the person beside you feel the same emotions you do. This phenomenon of \"correlation\" (to use a quantum term) binds fascination too, or rather the connection to another person through the eyes. With this type of direct technique an imagination of heat in one hand reflects in the person who looks at us, a feeling of scratchiness equally, and so forth.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of fascination is not an easy skill to master, but with time, effort, and the right techniques, it is possible to shape our mental material to influence others and improve our lives. From using light to magnify mental images to practicing energy exercises, there are various methods to enhance imagination and memory, attract positivity, and irradiate magnetism. By focusing on fixity, expression, and speed of the look, and combining them with self-discipline, patience, and determination, anyone can become a proficient fascinator and achieve astounding results."
