By reforming our childhood survival strategies, the author suggests we can access our delayed grief and fully integrate these functions into our present experiences, making us more fully present to live our own lives. The author also thanks Dr. Wolinsky for his commitment to expanding our consciousness and bringing together Eastern and Western thinking.",
  "content": "We need the ability to question and be resilient. These are not just childhood traits, they are human traits, essential to fully functioning human beings.

Let us thank Dr. Wolinsky for expanding our consciousness and bringing together the most profound Eastern and Western thinking, making him a much-needed teacher in these times of polarization."
