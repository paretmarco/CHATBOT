  "title": "\"How can multi-dimensional awareness help us accept the reality of death and choose the right approach to therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, \"The Tao of Chaos\" is mentioned as a source of religious concepts of death and souls' reincarnation being made up to defend against facing the most dissociated reality - death. This leads to individuals creating stories to defend against death. Chapter VIII Exercise #4 is suggested as a practice to develop the ability to stay in touch with the outer world, inner psycho-emotional world, and animal nature. The article concludes that no one system works for everybody, and it's about finding the client's needs and referring them to an appropriate person. In contrast to modern-day teaching, where everyone gets the same techniques, Sufi masters in the ancient tradition focused on the student's progress, which is client-centered work.",
  "content": "For example, if I had a marriage problem and went to a priest, he might say the problem was spiritual; an accountant would say economic; a body worker, \"It's in your structure\"; a psychotherapist, \"It has to do with Mom and Dad\"; a family therapist, \"It's in the context,\" etc. For this reason, we must learn to become more open to the fact that no one system handles it all. See the level the client needs to work on and be willing to refer them to an appropriate person. This is part of the art of a therapist or spiritual teacher. In the ancient Sufi tradition, a Sufi master would send individuals to different teachers so that the student could get the help they needed. This demonstrates that not only does one system not work for everybody or everything but one master's teaching does not work for everybody either. These Sufi masters made the student's \"progress\" the center of their approach and work, not their own personal desire to teach. This is client- or student-centered work. Unfortunately, nowadays when people go to a teacher or guru, they all get the same techniques.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's crucial to understand that no one system or guru can solve all problems associated with the body-mind-spirit connection. The art of being a therapist or spiritual teacher is to identify the client's needs and refer them to an appropriate person or system. The focus should be on the student's progress, not the teacher's desire to teach. By adopting this client-centered approach, therapist or teacher can help students to develop multi-dimensional awareness and find their unique way to the Way of the Human."
