  "title": "What is the Biological Core and How Does Trauma Impact It?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses how a traumatic experience can create a separate self or \"I\" as a way of organizing the chaos caused by interruptions in biology due to societal regulation. The nervous system plays an essential role in holding memories and creating associations as a survival mechanism. As a result, this mechanism makes one lose awareness of their present time body and biological core. However, in dropping past time body images and realizing the CORE, one can experience their biological essence and understand that it is made of the same substance as everyone else's. The author draws from Reich's term \"vegetative\" to explain this state of being.",
  "content": "`I particularly like Reich's term \"vegetative\" because vegetables don't have a self or psychology, they just are. '\"Note how the idea is refrained in psycho-spiritual work where \"learning lessons,\" mirrors the nervous systems's survival mechanism of organizing associations. Chapter VIII out it, and given the state of the spine, they would fall over. Thus in restoring the sense of natural strength and stability through the spine, the tensions disappear. That is, the person experiences a new state in which they no longer feel a necessity to hold themselves up. The notion of holding tension was an illusion. I find in this a profound possibility. And that is the opening to ESSENCE. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The BIOLOGICAL CORE is the physical manifestation of ESSENCE and is the physical bridge between the spaciousness of ESSENCE and the physical manifestation of the biology held together by gravity. \"GETTING THERE' When past time body images are dropped and the CORE is realized, you are not only in your BIOLOGICAL CORE and biological ESSENCE, you realize that \"your\" BIOLOGICAL CORE is the same as—and made of the same substance as—everyone else's biological ESSENCE.",
  "last_phrase": "In essence, embracing the natural strength and stability of the spine and shedding past body images allows us to tap into our biological core and experience the interconnectedness of everything. With this realization, we can let go of illusions of tension and embrace a profound possibility of oneness."
