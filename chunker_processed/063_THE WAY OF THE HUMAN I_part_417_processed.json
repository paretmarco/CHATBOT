  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the Minotaur complex, which is a bottom-line division of imagined separate self against imagined separate self in Quantum Psychology theory. The symptoms of this complex, including the split between body, mind, and spirit and the negative view of sexuality, are rampant throughout the world but most evident in religious and spiritual groups. The last 200 tokens explore these symptoms further, emphasizing the importance of seeing the body, mind, and spirit as the unified whole in Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "Somehow in this aspect of the Minotaur complex, the core distortion is that God and the VOID of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS can be reached more readily through sexual abstinence and that for God (VOID of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS) sex is BAD. This distortion does not see the body or sexuality as a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS but rather, due to unconscious repression, there is a fixation on sex, sex is seen as separate from the bodily functions and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and the unified whole. Simply stated, one does not see sex and the body as a condensation of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. SYMPTOM 2 The next symptoms in the Minotaur complex is the split that occurs between body, mind and spirit. In Quantum Psychology, the body is the mind is the spirit is the unified whole. When there is a splitting, this pits the body, the mind, and the spirit against each other. The manifestation of this is trying to overcome one for the other. In many religions and psychologies, the spirit or the mind is considered the most important.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the Minotaur complex can cause a distorted belief that sexual abstinence is the only way to reach God or the VOID of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, leading to a separation of body, mind, and spirit. It is essential to recognize that the body, mind, and spirit are interconnected and a condensation of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Embodying relational gravity by understanding wholeness can help in overcoming these distortions and attaining multi-dimensional awareness."
