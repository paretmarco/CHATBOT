  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author discusses the personalization thinking error and its origins, as well as the use of anesthesia to control pain through sensory distortion and energy dispersal. The personalizing style of hypersensitivity typically comes from a parent who does the same. By observing in present time, one can see that not everything is personal to them. The goal in anesthesia therapy is to offer recognition for other sensory experiences and increase variability to alleviate pain.",
  "content": "If you are an observer in present time, you will see the, \"I'm mad at you,\" is coming from your husbands' \"stuff' and not personal to you. Type III â€” Sensory Distortion, Energy Dispersal Anesthesia is used to control pain. Two cases illustrate this phenomenon. A woman presented herself for therapy with chronic neck pain. The emotional material that emerged was a child-like feeling, \"The world is going to collapse.\" I asked, \"Where does the experience of sensation feel sharper? Where does the experience of sensations feel duller?\" Using the word \"sensation\" helps to shift 120 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child the focus from pain to \"sensation.\" I continued, \"Where are the pain sensations burning? Where are they cooler?\" All trances fail to utilize all of the experience. The goal is to offer suggestions of recognition for other sensory experiences, so the subjective expe- rience shifts or varies slightly. Principle VIII: The greater variability offered any prob- lem, the less it remains fixed. A second example deals with localized sensations manifesting in a particular area, such as headaches.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Sensory Distortion and Energy Dispersal Anesthesia can be used to manage chronic pain in therapy sessions. By shifting the focus from pain to sensation and suggesting movement of sensations, relief from pain can be achieved. It's crucial to recognize and utilize all sensory experiences to provide variability to the problem and prevent it from becoming fixed."
