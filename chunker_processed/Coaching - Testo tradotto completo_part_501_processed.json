  "first_phrase": "The importance of controlling emotions in the world of trading is paramount, as it can affect serious psychosomatic health risks. By learning to feel emotions as mere sensations, rather than being consumed by them, traders can avoid errors and become more rational in their decision-making. This article emphasizes the significance of self-hypnosis in creating new mental perspectives and how traders seeking personal health should be cautious of psychosomatic risks.",
  "content": "The more you practice the discipline of feeling the emotions as mere sensations, the more you might become rational and capable of avoiding the risk of being \"hypnotized\" by the market. Trading and Personal Health Few people think of sedentary activities as being dangerous, and yet the trader who is actively engaged in his activity and seeks to solve the emotions which have been alluded to here above, is exposed to psychosomatic risk. That is in fact so as every emotional reaction corresponds to a particular biochemical reaction. Every emotional reaction, if it is kept for too long, tends to develop into a chronic form and thus reduce our capacity to have energy. Energy is, simply put, the capacity to operate. Our essential need is to spend and recover energy. Self-hypnosis for the Trader Some people think of hypnosis as being a state of lack of consciousness. The truth, however, is that hypnosis is a moment of intense receptivity, one in which the conscious processes of rational thinking are temporarily relaxed, and consciousness is far more present. This high receptivity is often linked to the presence of alpha waves. These waves are connected to the possibility of creating new associations and devising new mental maps.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, trading can put a strain on a trader's physical and mental health, especially if their emotions are not managed properly. However, through practicing the discipline of feeling emotions as mere sensations and learning self-hypnosis techniques, traders can become more rational, reduce their risk of chronic stress-related reactions and gain greater control over their behavior. Remember, the more you take care of yourself, the more capable you'll be of making sound trading decisions."
