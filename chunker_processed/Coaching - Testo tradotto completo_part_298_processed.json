  "title": "\"What is presentification and how can it help us achieve our goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the concept of presentification, where individuals visualize their future selves as already existing in the present moment. This process involves adding new particulars to the mental image and projecting the strength of desire onto it. In the last 200 words, the author emphasizes the importance of considering pre-ideation as a mission for the day and using our ardent desire to enliven the process. The author suggests that the brain must behave like a magical lamp, always facing the image of our desires, with the light cast by our ardent desire. This text provides practical insights on how to use presentification to achieve predetermined goals.",
  "content": "Essentially speaking, the procedure of presentification consists in “living out and, if possible, representing to our own selves, the image of our future self as being something which is already in existence”, not just the way “it will turn out to be”. In other words, within ourselves we must visualize the matter as having materialized, already at this stage, just as much as the mental image of it that we are formulating exists at once now. This vivid ideational stirring into being must not be cold and forceless. Rather, we should add, to the original mental nucleus, some additional new particulars. We have to do that for the sake of forging a living image and subsequently projecting into it the strength of our desire. During the execution of this operation, our brain must behave like a magical lamp, which is always being faced by the image of the objects of our desire. The light cast by such a lamp shall have to be represented by our ardent desire. In order to enliven such desire as much as possible, it is necessary that the subject matter of our pre-ideation must be regarded by us as a mission for that specific day.",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, presentification involves visualizing our future self as already existing and taking action to bring it to fruition. This requires a commitment to carry out the necessary steps and persevering through any challenges along the way. By doing so, we can experience a sense of satisfaction and look forward to a day filled with happiness. Remember to reflect on any obstacles and overcome them with determination, and the path towards your future self will become clearer."
