  "title": "\"How does working with amnesia help with psychological and physical components?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, Stephen, a therapist, works with a patient who has experienced amnesia in the past. Through a series of guided exercises, Stephen helps the patient to access and process past traumatic events that have been repressed. The importance of the mind-body connection is emphasized, as the patient learns to recognize and release physical symptoms associated with the trauma. This demonstrates the effectiveness of therapy in addressing the physical and psychological components of trauma.",
  "content": "(The symptom then emerges.) Stephen:Tell me what happens if you imagine your- self in a real situation where you were frustrated, but you could not remember. Can you see that kind of an image? Patient:Yes. Stephen:If you were to pull it back inside of your body, what happens? Patient:I feel stupid. Stephen:You feel stupid, and what is happening in your body and to your muscles? Patient:I'm giving it all, holding back right there (stomach area). 114 4' The Dark Side of the inner Child Stephen:(To Class. She already gave you a clue to an inner dialogue.) Did you hear what you said? (feeling stupid) Patient:I didn't hear what I said. Stephen:Did you hear what she said? (To another student) Student:Yes. Stephen:Did you? Patient:No. Stephen:Living proof of amnesia! Patient:It's not true. (Laughter) Stephen:There's an example of your amnesia. I learn from everyone I work with.",
  "last_phrase": "Remembering everything, or hypermnesia, can be a defense mechanism that helps us survive, but it's important to recognize that amnesia or forgetting can also be a result of our inner dialogue. By working through the process of understanding how our inner child creates symptoms, we can learn to better understand and work with ourselves and others."
