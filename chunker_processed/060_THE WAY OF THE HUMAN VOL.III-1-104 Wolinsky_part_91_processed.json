  "title": "\"What are the Physics Dimensions and Archetypes in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, the author explores the relationship between physics dimensions and archetypes in Quantum Psychology. Before delving into this topic, the author provides a brief overview of the various physics dimensions and forces that exist in the universe. The author emphasizes the importance of identifying and dismantling our preconceived notions of these dimensions in order to experience what \"is\" beyond our perceptions. Drawing on the metaphor of a prism, the author illustrates how the collective unconscious and archetypes can be seen as different colors of the same one substance, much like the physics dimensions that make up the universe. This section highlights the interconnectedness of different concepts and forces in our world, and how they all play a role in shaping our perception of reality.",
  "content": "To illustrate this, we will use the metaphor of a prism. Imagine taking a prism and shining a light through it. Depending on the kind of light and the angle of the prism, different colors are formed, creating a rainbow. However, it can be said, that the rainbow is still made of the same one light. In other words, the colors appear different, \"as if they were made of different substances, but this is an illusionâ€”the `See The Tao of Chaos. 85 The Way of the Human Beyond Quantum Psychology light is contained within the rainbow and is what the rainbow is made of. According to physics, before the BIG BANG and the creation of the universe, everything was NOTHING, THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. When the universe cooled the different Physics Dimensions were formed. In other words, imagine energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces as cooled parts of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, all of them now differentiating and exerting a \"force\" upon each other, and interacting with each other.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE exists within everything in the Universe. Our perception of the world is determined by the manifestations and interactions of the Physics dimensions and forces, which are essentially made of the same substance. This understanding can lead to a deeper appreciation and connection to the world around us."
