  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the defense mechanism of \"specialness\" created by neglected or abused children, and how it can lead to feelings of superiority and disconnection. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores how this defense mechanism can manifest in spiritual paths, where individuals may feel chosen or superior. The author emphasizes that this trance-like state of feeling special can lead to a host of negative feelings and that the quest for truth and enlightenment may actually be driven by this inner child's need for answers. Finally, the author draws connections between the concept of specialness and the trauma survivors may feel, such as those who have experienced incest.",
  "content": "This is not a small price to pay for the inner child' s desire to defend against chaos by creating the feeling of being special.\" Specialness and spiritualizing defend the child from the chaos he/she would have to face being raised in a dysfunctional family. Often times \"incest survivors\" feel special because they were \"chosen\" by Dad/Mom to receive this special attention. This child- like internal trance leaves an adult feeling: Misunderstood \"Don't people see I'm special?\" Alienated \"I have a secret (the incest) that would blow people away and hence nobody understands me, or Unseen People don't see my depth or people don't see me. 142 0 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Spiritualizing and Specializing In this spiritualizing trance of specialness, the secret (incest) is hidden from the child. The parents, who are now unconsciously seen as gods, have the secret. Later in life the child within the adult might be attracted to a guru who implies, \"I have the secret. The inner child within the adult feels compelled to find out, or know the truth, in the belief that \"The truth will set you free.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to recognize how the inner child's need for specialness and spiritualizing can stem from childhood trauma and dysfunction. Seeking out gurus or external sources to fulfill this need can lead to further harm. The path to healing involves uncovering the truth and freeing oneself from the trance of specialness, which can only come from within. Acknowledging and nurturing the inner child can help individuals move forward on the journey towards healing and self-acceptance."
