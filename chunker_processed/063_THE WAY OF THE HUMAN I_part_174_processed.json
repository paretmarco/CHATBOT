  "title": "How does our past body image affect our present experiences according to Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we delve into Quantum Psychology, where we learn that trauma not only affects a person's emotional and biological processes but is also associated with a past-time body image. The image of your body is not your body, and separating WHO YOU ARE from who you think you are is a crucial step towards experiencing present time. This is because images exist in the thinking dimension, impacting our relationships and creating belief systems. Clusters of images can even justify and create a value system, leading to obsessive-compulsive tendencies as we try to understand and defend against chaos. In the last 200 tokens, we see how these tendencies can have physical repercussions, leading to exhaustion and repression.",
  "content": "Clusters of images will 100 Chapter VI justify and create a value system or philosophy. If I'm walking down the street and a picture of my mother pops up, the image exists in the thinking dimension and I might in my relationships associate the past with the present. When this occurs, we dissociate and lose awareness of our body and our biological level. That's why Alexander Lowen said that when he starts to work with clients bio-energetically, and they start loosening a lot of the emotional levels, they usually experience more and deeper levels of exhaustion because they have repressed exhaustion. This is why, when you see someone after a therapy session, they will â€žoften say, \"I'm exhausted.\" They are fatigued because in order to keep this defensive tendency or image alive, they work hard and have to repress exhaustion which takes a lot of energy. Often, the attempt to obsessively-compulsively understand is a defense against experiencing what is actually occurring. Chaos is defended against because of our belief structure of, \"If I can understand what happened, then it will' be okay.\" There are several basic beliefs in obsessive-compulsive tendencies.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our tendency to obsessively understand things is often a defense mechanism against experiencing chaos and the uncomfortable emotions that come with it. Instead, we should focus on connecting with our bodies and emotions and accepting what has occurred, in order to move forward and create a meaningful value system or philosophy, as outlined in clusters of images presented in Chapter VI. By doing so, we can free up the energy we spend on defense mechanisms and truly live more authentically."
