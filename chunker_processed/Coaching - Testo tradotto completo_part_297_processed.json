  "title": "\"How can presentification turn us into magicians of our own selves and help us shape our future?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explored the concept of pre-ideation, a process carried out by the reason that goes beyond daydreaming. In the final part of the text, the author introduces the idea of presentification, an act of magic that involves pulling the future into the present. The author urges readers to first analyze the moods and words they desire to experience before using presentification to transform themselves into magicians who can perceive what their personality will be tomorrow. The final part emphasizes the importance of arranging and determining actions beforehand and arousing the desire and reality of the activity through presentification.",
  "content": "In that respect it is set aside from pre-ideation, which consists, on the other hand, in an act carried out by the reason. It goes beyond mere daydreaming, dreaming that is in a wakeful state. Every one of us has had at some point the experience of dreaming that he found himself in a particular state. The sheer, stark image of our self being catapulted into the future has hardly ever induced us to deviate from our set path. If, however, a dream — by answering our subjective impulses and needs — has managed to strike the intimate chords of our being –, has actually managed, that is, to reach into the cerebellum, into the nerve centres of all our motions, then our activity will have undergone a change in direction, and we will have arranged in advance, predetermined, whatever we needed so as to accomplish it within a demarcated period of time. Accordingly, after we have arranged and determined beforehand whatever action is becoming of us in the situation, we ought to arouse in us the desire and the reality of this activity through the medium of presentification.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if we want to achieve our goals, we need to move beyond daydreaming and create a vivid, living image of our future selves through the process of presentification. By adding new details and projecting our desire onto this mental image, we can change the direction of our activities and accomplish what we set out to do within a predetermined timeframe. Let us put this into practice and see the results of our efforts."
