  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve into a practical exercise aimed at relaxing the solar plexus, the nerve centre of emotions. This exercise leverages breathing techniques to boost vital force while calming the nerves. Before undertaking it, one should practise respiratory exercises to strengthen the abdomen muscles. The six phases of the exercise involve enforced abdominal breathing, inhale and exhale, and rapid movements to restore balance, followed by calming breaths. It is a useful antidote for unpleasant emotions or excitations.",
  "content": "It follows that, in order to bring it off properly, you should implement it sometimes when you are in a state of calm. 1° phase. – Lie down on the back of your body, free from any irritating piece of clothing. 2° phase. – Carry out, though the nose, an enforced abdominal breathing, and hold the breath you have inhaled thereby. 3° phase. – Let the air inhaled by the abdomen pass into the chest by brusquely lifting the diaphragm, while you simultaneously expand your chest so as to welcome in air. 4° phase. — Cause the inhaled air to move back to the abdominal wall, only for you to immediately push it back into your chest wall, 5 or 6 times in succession in a rapid manner, while always taking care to hold your breath well. 5° phase. – Exhale vigorously through the mouth. 6° phase. – Take some breaths for rest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, implementing the abdominal breathing exercise with the intent of absorbing vital force and driving away negative emotions can help regulate your nervous system and lead to a sense of calm and wellbeing. This, in turn, can contribute to the development of personal magnetism, a quality closely tied to emotional self-control. Remember to carry out this exercise in a state of calm for best results."
