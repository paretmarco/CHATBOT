  "title": "\"Why is denying our connection to our body denying our connection to the universe?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of including our animal and psycho-emotional nature in our spiritual practices. The false idea that we can separate from our body and our emotions has led to isolation and misunderstandings. Instead, the author advocates for embracing the body and emotions as vehicles to deepen our realization of the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness. This text also dedicated to presenting and completing the dimensions of awareness and achieving closure.",
  "content": "In The Way of the Human, the body is not to be excluded but included; emotions are not to be judged as bad, but as a vehicle to deepen our realization of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Many an ancient scripture contends everything is ONE, or as Quantum Psychology states, everything is made of THAT ONE SAME SUBSTANCE. This means also that the body, with its thoughts and feelings, is the same substance as everything else and is THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Spiritual philosophies (as we will explore later) are oftentimes spiritual trances which prevent us from experiencing the present moment; and more often than not, reinforce our internal psychological structures and developmental arrests, blocks, gaps and conflicts. This Volume is dedicated to humanity, with the understanding that our animal- and psycho-emotional nature must be included and seen as important as our essential nature so that ultimately the underlying unity of our Quantum nature can become stabilized and remain in our awareness. So the purpose of this Volume is 1) to present and complete the dimensions of awareness; 2) to have them written down, defined and clarified; and 3) to have closure, a completion for \"me.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, The Way of the Human advocates for the integration of our physical and emotional aspects, recognizing them as part of the same substance as everything else. This Volume aims to present and complete the dimensions of awareness, clarify concepts, and achieve closure. Ultimately, readers can transcend awareness, essence, and Quantum Psychology to reach the Nameless Absolute and beyond."
