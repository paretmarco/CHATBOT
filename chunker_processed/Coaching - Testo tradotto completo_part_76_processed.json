  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between indispensable and superfluous activities for time management. The key concepts discussed are setting out a clear purpose and taking firm action towards it, and avoiding activities that do not align with personal goals. The author emphasizes the need for personal reflection and analysis before embarking on any task. By doing so, we can manage our time better and devote it to meaningful pursuits. This text connects to the broader themes of productivity and self-reflection.",
  "content": "In order for it to have that quality, it is necessary for oneâ€™s will to intervene: In order to analyze the problem, its usefulness or otherwise, and the means which are suited to its solution; In order to resolve on the fact that such volition will not give up the study until and unless a solution to the problem has been reached. Distinguishing between indispensable and superfluous Activities Prior to us setting out to implement any thing, we are always given the chance to pause and consider whether it is indispensable (a categorical duty) or redundant. We must not accept everything which the superfluous has to offer us. We should limit ourselves to accepting only what conforms to our personal line of conduct, and can thus avail our objectives. Indispensable and Useful MUST BE DONE Superfluous yet in line with our purposes SHOULD BE DONE (PROVIDED TIME ALLOWS THAT) 18 Indispensable without being useful A RE-EXAMINATION IS NECESSARY: Why is it in fact indispensable? Superfluous and out of touch with our purposes MUST BE AVOIDED Many things which are seemingly indispensable are in actual fact redundant, and a great number of them are not worth the straining effort which is required to bring them about.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve success and satisfaction in our endeavors, we must distinguish between the indispensable and the superfluous activities. We should focus our volition on the necessary and useful tasks while avoiding the redundant ones. By questioning our motives and considering our past experiences, we can make better decisions and avoid acting recklessly. Remember, the key to smashing automatism and achieving our goals is to remain conscious and intentional in our actions."
