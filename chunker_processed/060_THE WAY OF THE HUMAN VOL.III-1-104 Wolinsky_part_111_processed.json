  "title": "How does the Electro-magnetic mechanism shape our understanding of the self and enlightenment?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Electro-Magnetics as the mechanism that creates the illusion of our sense of self. The previous paragraphs discuss how mantras, yantras, and tantras are used to change the vibration of sound in the Electro-Magnetic mechanism. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into the concept by explaining how the Electro-Magnetic mechanism creates the perception of separation and locational differences. Additionally, it discusses how our perception of self and enlightenment are an illusion created by the manipulation of light and sounds vibrations within the mechanism. Ultimately, it argues that when the light disperses, our concept of self disappears.",
  "content": "10s * Mantras are used in an attempt to change this \"you\" to another vibrational pattern at a higher frequency used to change sound patterns in the Electro-magnetic mechanism. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism uses mantras, yantras, and tantras as an attempt to change the \"you\" to another vibrational pattern, a higher frequency used to change the patterns of perception of the Electro-magnetics The vibration of sound makes me believe I AM. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism creates a unique sound like a snowflake and, therefore, a unique nervous system, and I AM is just based on its different locations in space-time. * Electro-magnetic mechanism gives the perception that we are all the sameâ€”when each sound vibration makes us different only the same through sound which is a by-product of light which is a by-product of the NOTHING. ________________ * The sense of I AM is frozen light. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism uses light to create the illusion of a seeER separate from the seen. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism makes you believe there is a you made of light. * The Electro-magnetic mechanism makes \"me\" believe in enlightenment. * When the light disperses there is no-me.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Electro-magnetic mechanism and the power of mantras, yantras, and tantras can lead us to a higher vibrational pattern and a new perception of ourselves. While the sense of \"I AM\" may be a by-product of light, we must also recognize the invisible force that organizes the universe - God. Remember that enlightenment is not just about seeing light, but realizing the Beyond that exists prior to light."
