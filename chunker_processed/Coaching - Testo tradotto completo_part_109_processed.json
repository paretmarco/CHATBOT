  "title": "\"What is the Light-Based Exercise to Activate Creativity and Improve Mental Potential?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the power of light to activate the creative mind, leading to an increased mental potential. Following this, the author delves into the benefits of both physical and spiritual relaxation, a practice employed by historical figures such as Napoleon and Immanuel Kant. The author concludes by discussing the futility of attempting to eliminate thoughts through logical means. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores various methods for interrupting thoughts, highlighting the importance of mindfulness and meditation.",
  "content": "The extent of its usefulness will be proportionate to how much it is then going to be followed by spiritual relaxation, that is, by the gradual relinquishment of every thought and every preoccupation, by the perfect atony of the terminal sympathetic nerves which are of no avail to our purpose, by the discontinuance of our cogitative faculty, until, at the end of the road, we finally become insensitive tamquam ac cadaver (“exactly like a corpse”). This cerebral relaxation has been practiced, as a most useful instrument, by the most famous men in history. Napoleon used to say that every evening you have to put down worries as you take off your clothes, “you should close the drawings of your brain and place your thoughts under lock and key”. As for Emmanuel Kant, he usually recommended one to “think of the wall” and, once such result had been achieved, to “think about the thought of the wall”. Available methods to interrupt thoughts Thoughts represent an activity which is engaged in by the conscious mind, by one’s logical part. They cannot accordingly be eliminated through a logical route.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing cerebral relaxation can be a useful instrument in achieving a state of mental calm and silence. To interrupt thoughts, one can employ various methods such as concentrating on a state of pleasant calm, mental observations, and tracing the sign of the mathematical infinite. With consistent practice, one can gradually achieve a peaceful state of mind tamquam ac cadaver."
