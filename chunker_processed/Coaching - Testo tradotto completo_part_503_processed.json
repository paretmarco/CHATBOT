  "first_phrase": "This text explores the possibilities of self-hypnosis as a means of learning new patterns of behavior and gaining self-control in stressful situations. The subconscious mind is compared to a servomechanism that makes learned experiences automatic, freeing up conscious thought for other tasks. In this last part, the focus is on the advantages of self-hypnosis for traders. Markets are complex quantum systems that demand intuition and creativity to succeed. Self-hypnosis can help traders develop these skills, allowing them to gain an edge. This section will explain how to employ self-hypnosis and link mental control to a creative process.",
  "content": "Through self-hypnosis we are capable of sewing a new being for ourselves; we might additionally come to learn how to release stress and anxiety, and simultaneously give effect to our natural capacity for self-improvement. There is yet another reason urging the trader to make use of self-hypnosis. Markets represent quantum systems in many different respects. In other words, they are not capable of being analyzed or described in terms of a purely linear model founded upon data which are present in the system, due to the convergence of individual psychologies belonging to multiple single operators which is generated. The unconscious mind, too, is a quantum system. It follows that, if we succeed in “becoming related” to the market, we will attain the capacity to develop intuitions and, through them, results which would otherwise not be attainable. How to employ self-hypnosis Unlike social hypnosis, which comes to us from the outside, self-hypnosis is carried out by the subject himself, and represents an essential key to the attainment of mental control. Mental control must also be linked to a creative process.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, self-hypnosis can be a powerful tool for traders seeking to develop their intuition and creativity in the unpredictable world of the market. By accessing the quantum system of our own unconscious mind, we can tap into new resources and achieve results that would otherwise be unattainable. However, it's important to remember that mental control must be linked to a creative process, rather than a spirit of competitiveness, in order to truly unlock our potential. Employing self-hypnosis can be a valuable step towards achieving this."
