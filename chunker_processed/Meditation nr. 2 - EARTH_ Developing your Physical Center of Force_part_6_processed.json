  "title": "Can the Enteric Nervous System Impact Human Health and Emotions More Than Previously Thought?",
  "first_phrase": "Neuro-gastroenterological studies suggest that the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the brain-gut axis (BGA) may play a profound role in human physiological and psychological operation. The ENS is far more complex and independent than previously thought and communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) via the BGA. Interestingly, the ENS affects mood and emotional well-being, suggesting that the role of the ENS in human health is stronger than previously thought. This part also discusses the Black Knight, who lives inside a tomb, and the Hara, a center of force in the body.",
  "content": "Anxiety, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and many other diseases have symptoms at the gut level, too",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that determining the underlying causes of gut symptoms can be crucial in identifying and treating various diseases, including anxiety and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, seeking medical attention and implementing a healthy gut regimen can potentially improve not just digestive health, but overall well-being and quality of life. Remember to prioritize your gut health and seek professional help when needed."
