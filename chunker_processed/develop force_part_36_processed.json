  "content": "The exercises that we present here for presence are: 1) Exercise of the point of standing; to maintain for as long as possible 2) Exercise of \"three times ten minutes\", to create a space for the presence 3) More useful exercises When to perform the recommended exercises? None of these exercises will actually steal your time, since you will perform them contemporarily to your daily activities. In particular, the exercise of the point of standing and \"three times ten minutes\" they must be performed as often as possible. Basic concepts The presence is a status of natural conscience, an enlarged perception compared to our concept of consciousness. It can also be defined as a status of \"reintegration\". Gurdjieff, many ancient alchemists, wise oriental Taoists, those who practice Yoga, and all of the esoteric traditions of all continents, they gather at the Summit on the concept of presence. Reintegration and Presence The presence is a gift essential to strengthen your fascinative force. Virtually, we do not leave anything out of us. In the practice, the first step is to develop the \"know that we are there.\" If we are \"present”, we are energetically denser in the situation. To develop such a gift, we have \"to want” to become increasingly conscious of ourselves. We have to be \"in things\", not to live our life in our thoughts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing presence in our daily lives is essential for strengthening our fascinative force and gaining an enlarged perception of reality. The exercises presented here aim to help us achieve this state of natural consciousness, with the \"three times ten minutes\" rule being particularly important. By practicing exercises such as creating a fixed point, focusing on the decreasing level of liquid, and integrating sub-sensorial responses, we can become more conscious of ourselves and our surroundings. Remember, the key to success is not to exhaust ourselves in prolonged exercises but to strive for consistency and mindfulness."
