Reintegration and Presence The presence is a gift essential to strengthen your fascinative force. Virtually, we do not leave anything out of us. In the practice, the first step is to develop the \"know that we are there.\" If we are \"present”, we are energetically denser in the situation. To develop such a gift, we have \"to want” to become increasingly conscious of ourselves. We have to be \"in things\", not to live our life in our thoughts.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating presence exercises into your daily routine can strengthen your fascinative force and enhance your ability to be in the present moment. Start with the exercise of the point of standing and \"three times ten minutes\" and gradually move on to other exercises such as arm folding, focusing on touch sensations, and integrating sub-sensorialties. Remember to start with short durations and not exhaust yourself, and eventually, practice these exercises in the midst of noise and distractions to increase your concentration abilities. With consistent practice, you can develop an enlarged perception and reintegrate your natural conscience to live a more present life."
