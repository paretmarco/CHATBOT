  "title": "\"What Causes Self-Destructive Urges in Trading? How Fantasy and Excessive Pursuit Lead to Misfortunes\"",
  "first_phrase": "At the end of this text, the author delves into the role of fantasy in human motivation, which often creates excessive and unnecessary needs. This concept builds upon the earlier discussion of fulfilling desires and crossing the point of equilibrium. The author argues that having a defined objective can help one avoid surrendering to these fantasy-induced needs, which can render them vulnerable, especially in the world of trading. The importance of this distinction is underscored by the fact that the same faculty that creates our problems, Fantasy, is also essential to our happiness.",
  "content": "It depends on that faculty which is both friendly and inimical to us, on that single human faculty which goes to great lengths in complicating the problem of happiness that animals solve by the mere act of living: It depends, in other words, on Fantasy. Fantasy predates need, and oftentimes even creates it in the first place. Put it differently, we imagine ourselves to be in need of something long before we actually develop such need; we imagine to have a larger need than our real need, or else we are the ones who concoct a fictitious need. All our efforts would in that case be directed at the fulfilment of such a need. Since, however, the motivational impulse was out of proportion, we would always tend to trespass the limit. This is what having an objective is of benefit to us for: It serves the purpose of defining a limit and avoiding the possibility of surrendering to a need. The needs we have in life, as well as those we are subjected to in the world of trading, might render us vulnerable, inasmuch as we become dependent upon something.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Fantasy, with its power to create needs and motivate us towards their fulfillment, can also become our enemy, leading us to exceed our limits and become vulnerable to destructive needs. To avoid this, having a defined objective is of utmost benefit, and accepting mistakes as lessons along the path to financial wellbeing is crucial. The road to success does not solely lie in focusing on money; rather, we must embrace balance and moderation in our approach to trading and life itself."
