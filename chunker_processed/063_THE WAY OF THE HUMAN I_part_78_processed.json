  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it view the False Core and False Self in relation to one's true identity?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Quantum Psychology and its radical difference from other psychological and spiritual systems. The author argues that attempting to heal or improve the False Core or False Self reinforces it and maintains that attempts to change it are based on the assumption that one is their False Core. The last 200 tokens discuss the importance of realizing that the observer is part of the False Core and the False Self Compensator. It emphasizes the need to understand these concepts in order to move beyond them and ultimately discover the non-verbal I AM or NOT-I-I.",
  "content": "In Quantum Psychology, we do not try to change it, or to take the good stuff and leave the bad, and there is no \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy.\" You are not your False Core or False Self Compensator. You can, however, use the False Core-False Self to describe who you imagine you are or were, realize you are not this and then discard it and discover WHO YOU A.E. Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"To discover who you are—you must first discover who you are not.\" Furthermore, \"r would like to note here that the observer is part of the False Core and the False Self Compensator. This is why observing the False Core-False Self cannot get \"you\" beyond them. Ultimately, when you begin to realize that all you think you are is either the observer or the False Core-False Self and its defensive compensations, there is the realization that there is no you, which is normally termed a self, and then there only remains the non-verbal I AM or NOT-I-I (see Volume III). Knowledge of the False Core-False Self is critical because wherever your mind moves—however it moves—you take your False Core with you.",
  "last_phrase": "Understanding and acknowledging your False Core and False Self Compensator is vital to your self-exploration and healing journey. By recognizing who you are not, you can discard those false identities and discover your true self. Remember, wherever your mind goes, your False Core follows. The key to inner peace is to identify and address the driving force behind these movements: your false sense of self."
