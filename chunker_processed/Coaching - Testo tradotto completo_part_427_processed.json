  "title": "\"How can you exercise the power of a coherence field for effective communication and coaching?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the creation of a Power-related Coherence Field and the concept of time. To be able to exercise such power, we must avoid excessive reasoning and focus on the present moment. The power of the coherence field requires traversing multiple phases or \"terrains.\" The first terrain is establishing communication with the outermost part of the person's psychology. Then, the energy field is thickened to make it denser, and the interlocutor senses our \"presence.\" In this final section, the author summarizes the different phases required to create a coherence field that can bring about results through a person's most profound layers.",
  "content": "During this phase, we in fact communicate with the outermost part of the person we are dealing with, in other words, with his psychology. Once we have created a connection at this level, a second and possibly even a third terrain might open up. What occurs in the “second terrain” is that we are going to thicken this energy field of ours, to make it denser, whereupon our interlocutor shall sense our “presence”. Frightening things might be accomplished in this phase. Instantaneous hypnoses, too, might be generated when one enters this state. Synoptic recapitulation of the different phases: Presence: It is the foundation, the first level Communicative Capacity: It is needed for the sake of laying the \"initial terrain\" Creation of a Coherence Field: It is the moment when we intervene at a deeper level than the level of the normal self, that is, the one in which we intervene, in order to bring about the realization of results, through a self which is ordinarily unconscious and which is linked to a person’s most profound layers.",
  "last_phrase": "By understanding the different levels of communication and tapping into people's unconscious layers, one can become more effective in coaching and communication. With practice, this can lead to a growth in influence over others and a more balanced development of potentialities for both individuals and organizations. Remember, presence is the foundation and creating a coherence field can lead to truly powerful results."
