  "title": "\"How can we ignite our will and achieve our purpose through the power of energy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author discussed the importance of having a specific purpose in order to activate the will towards a single direction. In the last 200 tokens, the author highlights the importance of conjoining the will with the \"neuric force\" or \"vitality\" of humans to fully actualize and attain its purpose. The author compares this force to the electrical force that sets machines in motion and states that specific exercises can retrieve and strengthen it. The accumulation, preservation, and distribution of energy are also compared to financial addition and subtraction.",
  "content": "A sufficiently extolled reason will always stir will into action, and yet such will is exposed to the risk of bending down a short while later, in the event that there is a deficient degree of the energy which is a sine qua non of psychological activity, namely, one’s nervous strength 4. Neuric strength, in fact, is man’s “vitality”. A healthy man, the one who develops himself in a balanced fashion, naturally possesses a certain amount thereof. As for the human being who is the victim of worries or is blocked by emotions or by his mental side, he causes such neuric force to get dispersed. Specific exercises are, however, capable of retrieving it as well as strengthening it. Accumulation, preservation and distribution of energy are thus comparable to a problem relating to financial addition and subtraction 5. Every financial problem has indeed two components to it: How to avoid losses, and how to maximize profits.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding the importance of neuric strength and taking specific exercises to retrieve and strengthen it, we can accumulate, preserve, and distribute our energy like a financial problem. This energy is the foundation of our personal magnetism and the key to success in both personal and professional relationships. So, let's focus on avoiding its dispersion and maximizing its accumulation to achieve our goals."
