The author highlights the rewards of creativity in today's world and cautions against the average person's tendency to follow some of the laws of least residence.",
  "content": "The law of the «least resistance» has the tendency of causing us to repeat the same thoughts every day, to always recall to our mind the same associations, and reiterate exactly the same observations. We are then contented with stereotypes and past experiences, without in any way reflecting over the fact that our ordinary activity is restricted within very narrow boundaries, beyond which fertile lands waiting only for someone to plough them are distended. Our mind is in truth capable of drawing infinite mental associations and devising infinite solutions to problems. Developing one’s creative potential Today’s world rewards whoever is able to come up with new solutions. Creativity is one of man’s natural gifts. The average man, however, is not free, simply because his mind is not free. Most of the times, in fact, the average man, though labouring under the illusion of acting of his own free will, follows some of the laws of least residence, which are respectively call obedience, imitation, association, and repetition.",

This book offers coaching to not only achieve success, but also true freedom from automatic mechanisms that rob us of our time and pleasure. Don't manufacture your own chains; break free and live fully in the present."
