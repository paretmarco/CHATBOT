  "title": "\"What is the Myth of the Minotaur and its Psychological Implications in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores how people often mistake their internalized critical voices as a part of themselves, when in fact, these voices belong to someone else, like a parent or caregiver. To overcome this, the author promotes de-hypnosis and Quantum Psychology to help individuals recognize their true identity before taking on others' programming. In this final section, the author turns attention to the myth of the Minotaur, a character embodying a powerful archetype that holds psychological insight into the human mind.",
  "content": "As Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"What you know about yourself came from outside; therefore discard it.\" The Way of the Human asks us not only to awaken to our own and other's trance-ference, but also to our own and others counter-trance-ference. It is only through becoming aware of, and looking objectively at, these primitive trances which dominate our interactions, that we can become free and recognize our full human potential. APPENDIX JUST FOR FUN THE LIBERATION OF THE MINOTAUR Part I I n his theory of psychoanalysis, Freud used the Oedipus myth to describe both a psychological state and what he himself considered a sociological condition. Quantum Psychology does not believe in myths. MYTH: A traditional or legendary story usually concerning deities or demi-Gods; any invented story; an imaginary or fictitious thing or person (American College Dictionary, 1963, p. 8) But often times myths, even if they are misunderstood, can describe through veiled symbology, powerful archtypes and psychological insights and situations which mirror the internal world. In this way, Quantum Psychology turns its attention to the myth of the Minotaur. Few myths or veiled characters have been so misunderstood and yet contain such a depth of psychological understanding.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing the Way of the Human requires a willingness to shed preconceived notions of self and the recognition of primitive trances that dominate our interactions. As Nisargadatta Maharaj said, we must discard external knowledge to recognize our full potential. The myth of the Minotaur serves as a powerful tool for psychological understanding and insight, inviting us to explore its symbols and message for implications and applications in our relationships."
