  "title": "How can we develop our inner power and improve our concentration through exercises for our brain and body?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses exercises aimed at developing inner power and fascination. It emphasizes the importance of aligning the spinal column to ensure the two brains governing our body operate consistently. The last 200 tokens outline various exercises for inter-hemispheric coordination and the awakening of the central fire. The exercises target different senses and motor skills and include focusing on a mirror, observing a point while moving the head, clapping, counting necklace grains, and rotating the body and head. These exercises are essential to developing presence and ultimately, inner power. The text also notes that this school of thought may date back to pre-Roman times in Italy.",
  "content": "25: body flexibility Exercise Another very valuable exercise to maintain the elasticity of the torso is to put hands on the hips, and turn body from right to left. In this way, we avoid tensions that could block the energy. Exercise 26: head They also rotate their heads from right to left. It is indeed up to the neck, which often create tension which can block the energy. Even more effective is the rotation is made before bringing back the head. Exercise: 27. Resume exercises of presence indicated previously In our book, Mesmerismus and \"Trance\" there are many exercises are useful for this purpose. At this point, we are ready for the \"exercises for hemispheres\" that are symbolically linked to polarities in humans. Probably a school of this type, connected with the development of the power of gaze, is probably present in Italy even since pre-Roman eras, which would explain how there are still many people who know and practice this technique. The Etruscans had in fact represented the eye on many everyday objects. Moreover, their winged deity in the symbology below implies the same concepts of the exercise that we will be presenting shortly. In it, we may see how the power of breathing (represented by the wing, which is the element of air) relates to the eye. At the same time we see clearly how this is a force, represented by the sword. The two aquatic tails show clearly the dual aspect behind this energy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the exercises presented in this text can help you maintain body flexibility, reduce tension, overcome polarities, and awaken magnetism. These exercises include rotating the torso and the head, practicing the hot water and cold water exercise, increasing presence to different parts of the head, and using light as a tool to awaken abilities and powers. By incorporating these exercises into your daily routine, you can improve your physical and mental well-being and increase your brain capacity."
