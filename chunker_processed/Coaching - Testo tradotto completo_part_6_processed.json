  "title": "How Can the Desire to Live Help You Achieve Happiness and Success?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the most universal and commonly popular ideals of man: Living long and living well. The means to actualize these goals include good health, money, time, and the crucial key - the Desire to Live. This \"active will\" has the power to multiply time and is the sole desire to find an external outlet of self-expression. The author highlights the importance of pleasure in living and how it engenders attentiveness to life, making one discover and develop opportunities. The last part (200 tokens) focuses on how this desire to live leads to persevering and ultimately achieving concrete results and felicity.",
  "content": "A depressed person, a person enslaved by some habitual routine, or a bored individual, might ostensibly achieve success in a chance manner, such as by winning the lotto associated with sports results. But even on the assumption such people “won” in that sense, they would probably be unable to know what to do with the money thus gained, and they would soon fritter it away in some useless undertakings. What we call “desire to live” is, by contrast, a vital energy, the sole desire of which is to find an external outlet of self-expression. It is a desire to be and to enjoy the universe. By self-exteriorization, such desire naturally leads one to attain the benefits of concrete results and felicity. Those who score the highest are also people who find pleasure in living and in all the marvellous aspects which the world can offer. It is precisely this pleasure which engenders attentiveness to life, which makes one discover opportunities and develop them, and which allows him to be persevering.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, cultivating a desire to live is essential to achieving concrete results and happiness. This desire leads to self-expression, attentiveness, and perseverance, allowing one to discover opportunities and develop them. By rediscovering or perpetuating this desire, we can acquire, perpetuate, and multiply health and wealth. The true art of being happy lies in knowing how to keep alive an enduring and ardent joy, which makes life fuller and more interesting. With this guide, you can manage all aspects of your life and extend it while developing an interest in work and pleasure."
