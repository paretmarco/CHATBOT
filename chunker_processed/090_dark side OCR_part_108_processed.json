  "title": "\"What is Inner Dialogue and Its Impact on Self-Talk and Problem States?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of inner dialogues and the fusion of the inner child with \"should\" voices from parents were discussed. Now, the focus is on handling these shoulds by observing and experiencing them intentionally. The text also explores the two sides of the inner child and how the family can reinforce the inner dialogue, creating problem states. Self-talk is part of these trance states, and it always influences how a person perceives themselves and the world. The source of self-talk is the unprogrammed person or child before the beliefs and ideas suggested by parents.",
  "content": "In this system, the spouse or family can say or re-enforce the inner child's self-talk, thereby reinforcing her problems. For ex- ample, an inner child phrase, \"What' s wrong with me?\" can be reinforced when the family or the spouse says, \"What's wrong with you?\" Inner Dialogue â€¢ 67 Self-talk is not always verbal; it can be nonverbal, or silent. The individual can infer or intuit through silence or nonverbal cuing. As an example, a parent that is silent, never enquiring about the child' s well being, might deliver the message, \"Nobody is interested in you.\" Self-talk is always part of a problem and is implicit in many trance states. Where does Self-Talk Come From? An unprogrammed person, or a child before all the beliefs and ideas are suggested by the parents, is a pure observer or witness to life. The observedust observes; things happen or don't happen and the open blank slate of the observer is just present. The beauty of this observer is that there is no judgment, such as this is bad or that is good.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, self-talk is a powerful tool that can have lasting effects on an individual's well-being. It can be influenced by external factors such as family and societal expectations, but ultimately it originates from our own minds. By becoming self-aware of our self-talk, we can identify and challenge negative beliefs and create a more positive inner dialogue for a healthier and happier life."
