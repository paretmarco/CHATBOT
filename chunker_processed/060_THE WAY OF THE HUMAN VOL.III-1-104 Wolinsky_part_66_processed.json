  "title": "How can dismantling the False Core lead to the realization of ESSENCE and Separation?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, Debra discusses her feelings towards her ex-partner John with Wolinsky. She realizes that she still loves him but acknowledges the separation at different levels. Wolinsky helps Debra to feel solid and connected, leading her to experience essence through her biological core. The text highlights the realization of essence and the separation at emotional, thinking, and biological dimensions. ESSENCE is a set of essential qualities, and it does not require any work as it is a natural aspect of our being.",
  "content": "Now, in that solidness, where do you feel it in your body? Debra:Kind of through here (pointing to the center of her body, her biological core). 65 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter Wolinsky:See if you could have the experience not only from your pelvic floor to your solar plexds, but also from the top of your cranium clown to here (sternum) where they meet. Debra:Yeah, I feel it in my eyes. Wolinsky:How are you doing? Debra:Great! CONCWSION Here we see a movement from the False Core to distractors, its manifestation in her present-time relationships being dismantled. This leads to the realization of ESSENCE, and simultaneously the Realization of Separation at the thinking, emotional and biological dimensions. Simultaneously, the Biological Core is a physical manifestation of ESSENCE and hence it too reveals itself. Note that ESSENCE contains Essential qualities, like love with no object, compassion, peace, etc. ESSENCE does not need work, rather as Gurdjieff said, \"Essence is what you were born with, personality is what you acquired.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of dismantling the False Core-False Self leads to the realization of ESSENCE, which contains essential qualities such as love, compassion, and peace. By recognizing and uniting with our Essential Core, we can stabilize the realization of separation and experience its delicious qualities. Remember, there is no self separate from the lens through which it perceives, and the self arises and subsides within that lens."
