  "title": "\"What is the relationship between ESSENCE, False Core, and the mislabeled void of consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section of the text, the concept of ESSENCE is explored further; it is the last state that has qualities that can be termed \"individual.\" The previous section discussed how the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is mistakenly named the individual soul. This realization is what separates Hinduism from Buddhism. It should be noted that (mis)labeled ESSENCE can be perceived as a problem and can lead to existential pain. Furthermore, labels placed on ESSENCE can become part of the alleged Archetype known as the shadow. All these aspects are discussed in the context of the shock of the Realization of Separation, which people tend to blame on the misperceived BIG EMPTINESS.",
  "content": "(Mis)labeled ESSENCE is then perceived as being a problem. It should be noted that the (mis)labeled spaciousness of ESSENCE becomes empty (as in a lack), and can mis- 2 Chapter 1 takenly be seen as the reason for what has been termed \"existential pain.\"' Existential pain (often described as emptiness within the physical body) is labeled as the \"meaninglessness,\" or \"aloneness\" etc., of life. The seeking of meaning by people is actually the False Self's attempt to overcome this False (mis)label of emptiness (as in a lack) which is placed on the spaciousness of ESSENCE. It can also be said that labels placed on ESSENCE subsequently become the alleged Archetype known as the shadow (see Chapter 3, \"The Collective Unconsciousness\"). For now, it can be said that all the things you do not want to know because they are associated with the shock of the Realization of Separation are blamed on the (mis)labeled (mis)perceived BIG EMPTINESS which is now emptiness (as in a lack) (which is not ESSENCE).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to understand that the (mis)perceived emptiness within ourselves is not our true essence, but rather a false label that leads to a sense of existential pain. By recognizing this mislabeling, we can begin to overcome it and find true meaning in our lives. Let us remember that we are not defined by our problems, and that our true essence is much greater than the labels placed upon us."
