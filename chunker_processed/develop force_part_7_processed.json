  "title": "What is the power of the eye and how can it be developed for everyday life, therapeutic purposes, and personal growth?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of the human eye and the potential for fascination and hypnosis that it holds. The author recounts their experiences with a man named Virgilio T., the last of the fascinators, who is said to possess a deep understanding of this ancient practice. Utilizing techniques of self-development and self-improvement, the author and several others became Virgilio's students and intimate associates. The text also discusses the contributions of the late Prof. Erminio from Pisa to the study of therapeutic fascination. Overall, the text delves into the potential of the human eye, both in interpersonal relationships and as a tool for healing.",
  "content": "He used to refer to fascination by the term of “instantaneous hypnosis”. In spite of the fact that both Virgilio T. and Erminio from Pisa were consummate masters in this art, the former, albeit capable of producing rapid results, operates only by leaving a superficial and short-term imprint, at a time that the work carried out by the latter pushes this technique onto a different level, one that has a deep effect and succeeds in healing plentiful pathologies on an enduring basis. In so doing, it traces itself back to a long tradition of therapeutic fascination. After all, Virgilio, fully aware as he was of his limits, made use of his brand of hypnosis, never mind how spectacular, only as a game or for theatrical effect, whereas Prof. Erminio from Pisa was accustomed to assiduously cure dozens of people on a weekly basis, within his study, as part of his regular professional activity. Most of these persons would get cured in a single session lasting ten seconds or so. Even those who were most amenable to recurrent relapses, needed no more than 2 to 3 sessions before the beneficial effects of fascination accomplished through the look embedded themselves firmly in their organisms. Prof. Erminio was a person marked by a forceful personality. In his work methodology, as was the case with the ancient people, he always strove to be in a state of balance with the universal harmony, which he used to discern as a result of his astrological studies. It is thus from him that we have learnt how to employ this art for healing purposes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination through the use of the eyes is an ancient technique that has been used for both therapeutic and persuasive purposes. While some masters like Virgilio T. used it as a game or for theatrical effect, others like Professor Erminio from Pisa used it to cure dozens of people on a weekly basis. The power of fascination lies in the eyes, and with proper training, it can be a valuable aid in hypnotic influence and personal growth. Overall, the eye is a powerful sensory organ that has been at the heart of human culture and traditions throughout history."
