  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Debra shares her story of trying to gain her parents' attention through various means but feeling disconnected from them. In the final 200 tokens, therapist Wolinsky asks Debra to reflect on her relationship with a man named John and notice similarities with her parents. Debra mentions pretending to get attention from John and feeling betrayed by him, similar to how she felt about her parents. Wolinsky suggests fusing the world and her parents, and encourages Debra to notice what she creates. The text explores the theme of feeling disconnected and seeking attention and validation from others, and highlights the role of therapy in helping individuals recognize patterns in their behavior and relationships.",
  "content": "Debra: Wolinsky: Debra: Chapter 1 \"Since I couldn't get you to reflect back to me, I felt betrayed.\" What are you feeling now? Just the story all the times that there were no connection or relationship between my mom and my dad and me. Yeah, they didn't know who I was at all. They were always nice but separate. They never yelled, they were like two wooden figures or cardboard cutouts in the house. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Wolinsky:Tell me a similarity between this relationship with John and your relationship with your parents. Debra:Well, the preten'ding to get them to respond so I would feel worthwhile. A. lot of pretending. Like when I was a little girl, trying to get the attention and trying to get that from John. Wolinsky:And you said you felt betrayed with John. Debra:Yeah. Wolinsky:And you felt betrayed by your parents. Now, let's take this philosophy and put it over here (other side of the room). If you fuse together the world and your parents, what are you creating?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing the fusion between personal relationships and the world can help in unlocking deeper issues and addressing them through a six-step defusion process. It is important to acknowledge and understand our past experiences to prevent ourselves from resisting similar situations and individuals who do not pay attention to us."
