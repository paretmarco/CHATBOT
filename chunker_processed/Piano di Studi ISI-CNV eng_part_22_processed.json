  "title": "What is Quantum Discipline and how can it be used to achieve success?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves into the concept of \"Quantum Presence\" as the path to higher self-awareness and the culmination of all traditions of self-seeking. The author discusses the practical consequences of this state, such as heightened personal and professional success, and the ability to influence others and oneself through the techniques of fascination. The text also touches on the role of magnetism and its relationship with the implicate order, as well as the holographic model and the stratification of reality according to Quantum PSI. The section provides information on the course and certification offered by the school, with a detailed breakdown of the workshop's content.",
  "content": "For a quantum computation can take place it is essential that the information remains consistent and is not lost to the environment 10. Holographic Model: the holographic model is essential to constitute a theory of learning and information retrieval. Approach implies a \"top-down\". 11. Presence and consciousness and their relationship with the implicate order. Presence can be a pathway to accede to the implicate order starting from the explicate order 12. Phase and Frequency: The information you have the same phase can be combined more easily. The interference patterns apply to this situation The model of reality of Quantum PSI Quantum Psi observes reality by dividing it into layers. In fact, we live in our own subjective universe. We stratify it on the basis of our experiences and this is what is meant by common sense as existence. Quantum Psi assumes that there is also something before everything: consciousness, that is what we really are. - The deepest layer is the objective state or consciousness: how do we know to exist? Even the Greeks had understood that we are not our thoughts and thinking we exist. Consciousness is a process not computable. - After we have the layer of space-time. Time and space are self-referential structures created by the individual and represent the set of structures that define the world. Their characteristic is that there are not quantum, and transcending them you can access to a level of quantum reality. Within this structure the individual feels the energy flowing in particular direction defining the so-called \"emotional states\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the quantum model of reality posited by Quantum PSI suggests that consciousness is the foundation of everything. The model proposes that by accessing the implicate order, which is the deepest layer of individual experience, we can find a pathway towards enlightenment. The techniques of NLP-3, which are an improvement upon NLP, can be used to improve communication skills and to enhance personal magnetism. Through quantum thinking and the application of these techniques, it is possible to achieve success in business, coaching, and personal relationships, and to tap into the power of personal influence."
