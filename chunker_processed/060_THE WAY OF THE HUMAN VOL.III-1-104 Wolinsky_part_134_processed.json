  "title": "\"How does the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS form Archetypes in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text presents a discussion between Karen and Wolinsky in which they delve into the concept of the \"I AM\" mechanism and its relationship with the self. The last 200 tokens of the text discuss archetypes as a condensation of the void of undifferentiated consciousness and how this relates to the creation of the self. The authors explain that unlike many current theories, Quantum Psychology understands that the void condenses and creates what individuals perceive as themselves. Thus, individuals are not in control of creating their universe, but rather the universe creates the self.",
  "content": "Therapeutic Note Once the verbal I AM-IS is gone beyond, the False Core-False Self and all \"subjective\" psychology too is gone beyond. Then only the NON-VERBAL 1AM might remain or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, THE ARCHETYPE REVIEW Archetypes can be viewed as a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS forming what \"our\" nervous system views as a pattern emerging from any possible number of combinations of the Physics Dimensions of energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces, etc. To review the process, let us begin with the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. The VOID is pure NOTHINGNESS, and to paraphrase again, noted physicist John Wheeler, \"NOTHINGNESS is the building block of the universe.\" However, the NOTHINGNESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS has the quality of being \"potentially\" everything. It should be noted that unlike many current theories which believe that \"you\" (solidified VOID) can control, create, or co-create \"your\" universe, Quantum Psychology understands that the VOID condenses and creates what you call \"you.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Void of Undifferentiated Consciousness, Archetypes, and the Collective Unconsciousness can deepen one's knowledge of the Self. Rather than controlling the universe, Quantum Psychology suggests that the void condenses to create individuals, and each archetype is a contraction of the physics dimensions. By recognizing these patterns and understanding their origins, one can gain greater insight into their own unconscious mind."
