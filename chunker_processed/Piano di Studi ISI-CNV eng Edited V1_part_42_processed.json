  "first_phrase": "This text explores the world of hypnosis and magnetic healing, with a particular emphasis on the work of Dr. Paret and his lineage of teachers. The previous sections have covered the roster of patients he has treated, his approach to hypno-magnetism, and the continuing education and training opportunities available for those interested in becoming operators. The last 200 tokens focus on the practical applications of hypnosis and magnetic healing. They review the history of magnetism since Mesmer, examining the techniques of Puysegur, du Potet, and the Durville brothers. Finally, the text explores the concept of \"persuasive fascination\" and its applications in areas such as business and leadership. The course ends by offering a certification as an international master coach, a profession in which the ability to persuade and fascinate is essential.",

He chaired the Astrological Association of the Light since 1973, and acted as director of the Centre of Instant Hypnosis. At the age of 14, he fully devoted himself to the study of hypnotic techniques. He has hypnotized more than 250.000 persons. For several years, both the Italian state-owned radio and television have shown us his parapsychic exploits: Collective hypnosis of a theatre audience, distance paranormal healing, announcing the final result of the “Corsa Tris”, a horseracing event, fifteen minutes before it even started, and so on. Mesmer. The method elaborated by F. A. Mesmer allows healing to take place quite rapidly, especially when a group is formed and symbols are utilized. Many techniques come from the lineage Mesmer ? Puysegur ?Du Potet ? Durville . Historically speaking, magnetism after Mesmer continued with Puysegur and his disciple Baron du Potet, whose pioneering efforts were then taken further by the Durville brothers. The Durville brothers founded a secret order and we continue directly some of their techniques. Fascination: our lineage comes from Virgilio T. and Donato. Virgilio, one of the persons who inspired us the most in the field of animal magnetism, is capable of instantly fascinating another person. Donato is a historically significant powerful character who inspired tens of individuals and experimenters, and who transformed the way animal magnetism was perceived during the previous century. He would fascinate through the look, and he impressed the whole of Europe due to his incredible ability.",
