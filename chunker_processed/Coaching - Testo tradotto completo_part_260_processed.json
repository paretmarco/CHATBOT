  "title": "What is the key to enduring pleasure and true happiness, and how can we plan and execute our goals effectively?",
  "first_phrase": "This article has explained how pleasure isn't in things but in one's organic receptiveness to the world. Pleasure is represented by being in the present moment and seeing reality as it is. In the last 200 tokens, the author highlights that joy is not simply the sum of pleasures, but rather a general organic condition that enables someone to be more sensitive to pleasure and experience true happiness. This is important for understanding the concept of the enduring pleasure the author has been guiding us to.",
  "content": "According to this vision of things, the only existing desire is the logical, active desire which is on its way to actualization. It is, in other words, the knowledge that a certain thing becomes actualized, whereupon we set the organism in motion. An unreal or impossible desire is, for that very reason, a lifeless desire, one which is divested of dynamic virtue. I do not desire to go to the moon. The desires which, at this stage, fall outside my reach leave me unmoved. In conclusion, it must be stressed that joy does not lie in things, but in organic receptiveness and in our capacity to be heedful to whatever exists in the moment. This is what grants access to true happiness, which is more than the mere sum- total of pleasures. It is in fact a general organic condition, a disposition to experientially feel pleasure, a sensibility which is orientated towards pleasure, and a spiritual mood which derives enjoyment from all of that. It is nature enjoying its own self, and leading therefore to the pleasure ensconced in the now, as well as in becoming impassive to pain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize that true happiness lies not in unattainable desires, but in our ability to be receptive to the present moment. To achieve this, it is essential to break down our overall life plan into secondary plans that correspond to specific periods and needs. By further subdividing these plans into monthly, weekly, and daily actions, we can achieve concrete actualization and move towards our goals with purpose and intention."
