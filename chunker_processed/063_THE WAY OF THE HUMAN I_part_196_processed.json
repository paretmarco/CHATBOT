  "title": "How Does Quantum Psychology Explain the Understanding of the Body-Mind Connection and the Origin of Concepts?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the body-mind, where the body and mind are not separate entities, but rather made up of the same substance and functioning together. The origin of thoughts and beliefs is seen as an interpretation of experiences made by the nervous system. The question arises whether body-work alone is sufficient for addressing issues or if psychotherapy is necessary. According to quantum psychology, the problem requires addressing at the level it exists.",
  "content": "The origin of concepts and thoughts can be seen in the following way: I have an an experience and the nervous system, neurologically speaking, organizes that experience, much later in time. This organization of experience is what we call an interpretation of what the experience means; for example, something happens and I now have an interpretation called \"I am bad.\" Later, that belief becomes the organizing principle which interprets what \"subjective\" and \"outside\" experiences mean. In this way the thinking dimensions and its accompanying beliefs are an intermediary between \"inside non-verbal\" experiences and the \"outside external world.\" A major question often arises from body-workers, such as Feldenkrais practitioners or Rolfers. They will maintain (since both Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais and Dr. Ida Rolf, the founder of Rolfing, im- 121 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness plied that all you need to handle is the body) that if the body is the central aspect of the organism as a whole, you don't need psychotherapyâ€”body work will take care of it all. According to Quantum Psychology this is incorrect. Why? QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The problem must be met at the level of the problem.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while bodywork such as Feldenkrais or Rolfing is beneficial in addressing physical issues, it may not be enough to address deeper psychological problems such as phobias or low self-esteem. According to Quantum Psychology, the problem must be met at the level of the problem, which means that a comprehensive approach that includes therapy and bodywork may be a more effective solution."
