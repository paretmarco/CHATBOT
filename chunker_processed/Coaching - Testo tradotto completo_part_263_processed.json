  "title": "\"Why are tactics important in achieving our goals and how can we use intuition to succeed?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the focus is on the importance of tactics and intuition in the execution of minor plans and daily plans. The author emphasizes the need to link these plans strictly to the overall life plan in order to draw value and full justification from them. Tactics are crucial in utilizing available resources effectively, and intuition can help make pragmatic use of all resources to achieve desired outcomes. A soccer-coach example is used to illustrate the importance of the right tactical moves, and how intuition can lead to success.",
  "content": "If I am a soccer coach blessed with a side of technically formidable players in each position of the field, and I have at my disposal, in addition, alternatives who are equally gifted from a technical point of view, and yet I make the wrong tactical moves, my team risks losing the match even if, on paper, it is the stronger of the two sides. Assuming that, in the course of a particular game, when things appear to be turning against my side, I have an “intuition” and opt to substitute a certain player with specific technical characteristics with another one whose technical characteristics are different we might end up winning that match. It cannot be said that, in absolute terms, this substitute will make me win all the games. We can however assert that in that particular game he was the right player at the right time. What are the steps available to us if we want to implement some tactics which will turn us into winners? We can achieve that through intuition! Intuition emerges from our inward. It is through its medium that we can make pragmatic use of all our resources, so as to succeed in achieving whatever we wish.",
  "last_phrase": "To increase your chances of winning, it's crucial to trust your intuition and learn to utilize your available resources effectively. Nurture your unconscious mind through deliberate and focused intents, and patiently develop your intuition over time. With practice, you'll gradually unlock the full potential of your subconscious and make better tactical moves that could potentially win matches."
