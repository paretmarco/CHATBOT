  "title": "What is the \"I Love You Trance\" and How Does it Affect Us?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how we react to one another, creating trances that bounce back and forth. Our responses are valuable tools as soon as we learn to identify them clearly. The author provides an example of a common experience called the \"I Love You France,\" where we move from an enjoyable experience to one that can result in distress. We start obsessing over details and recreating past experiences through various deep trance phenomena. The final 200 tokens give an example of a client who had a similar experience at work, making his distress clear.",
  "content": "Should 1 tell her/him my daily schedule??'?\" (pseudo-orientation in time, post- hypnotic suggestion, age regression). From an enjoyable, in-the-moment experience, we suddenly move into one which creaks and struggles beneath structures of reactions. In essence, we are recreating the past in present time via various Deep Trance Phenomena. As we saw in a previous section, these trance phenomena \"shrink-wrap\" our focus of attention, leaving a very constricted perspective with which we usually strongly identify. I had a client who arrived one day for a session red-faced and fuming. Jack immediately launched into a tirade about the event that was \"causing\" his distress.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it can be tempting to unconsciously recreate our past experiences and traumas in the present moment through deep trance phenomena, it's important to remain aware of our reactions and perspectives. Before sharing our daily schedule or any personal information with others, it's worthwhile to assess our motivations and assess potential risks. By staying mindful and grounded in the present, we can avoid unnecessary distress and communicate more effectively."
