  "content": "Concerning emotions in general In order to alleviate or avoid the often very unpleasant consequences of a violent emotion, a fit of rage, a strong adversity, a displeasing event, a fear or even too vivid a joy, you should withdraw into your rooms and lie down on the bed in a perfectly horizontal position, after having loosened your clothes by your waist and your chest so as to avert any possible obstruction to your breathing. While in this position, you should practice some respiratory exercises, insisting on breathing through the abdomen as much as possible. Doing that produces a massage of the solar plexus, which, as we know, is the nervous centre of emotions. You must be conscious of your breathing. The said massage will excite the depressed nervous centres, while respiration supplies them with vital force. Thereupon, nervous balance will be re-established, following either one or several sessions. We accordingly wish to mention here under an additional exercise, which is specially combined with a view to carrying out an energetic massage of the solar plexus, as that has a propensity to infuse calm. This exercise requires a bit of practice.",
