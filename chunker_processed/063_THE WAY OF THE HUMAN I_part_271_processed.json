  "title": "How does dissociation attempt to order chaos in quantum psychology and why is it important to separate out the dimensions?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores how the body's nervous system reacts to shocks and uses dissociative trances as a survival mechanism to order the resulting chaos. It explains how a phobia, for instance, can be a result of the body reacting \"as if\" it were in danger, despite the absence of a real danger. The text also delves into the creation of mystical realms as a next dissociative step after thoughts and labels fail to handle the chaos. In the last 200 tokens, it emphasizes the importance of processing the biological false core by tracing it back to the fight/flight response in order to break the psychological trances. The text concludes with a question: Why is it so essential to separate out the dimensions?",
  "content": "The body's shock—oabstractions—qear—images of death, etc. This is why the biological—)psychological trance must be broken. PROCESSING THE BIOLOGICAL FALSE CORE I. Tracing it back to the fight/flight response. To be done by yourself or with a partner: When trances do not work, in order to handle the level of chaos, we create mystical realms inhabited by Gods and Goddesses, etc., which are the next dissociative move after thoughts and labels. All of these biological attempts to preserve itself are intrinsic to the body's survival mechanism. ________________ Notice a tension, pressure, pain, etc., you have in the body. Ask yourself or another, \"Tell me an idea you have about the pain, pressure, tension, etc. ((fill in the blank).\" Continue this until nothing pops-up. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the shock, the greater the dissociation and separation from the biology. In this way, the body has a fight/ flight response and a dissociative trance response—in short, a way to battle shock using an emotional, thought or spiritual buffering trance process to organize chaos. Why then is it so important to separate out the dimensions?",
  "last_phrase": "Breaking the biomedical-psychological trance is crucial to prevent dissociation, obscure perceptions, and negative emotional patterns. By tracing the fight/flight response and identifying dissociative moves like mystical realms or Gods, we can dismantle the collapsing of dimensions. Through a simple process of questioning ourselves or others, we can alleviate pain and pressure and reprogram the nervous system for deeper learning."
