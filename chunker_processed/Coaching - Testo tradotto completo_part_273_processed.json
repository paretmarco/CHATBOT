  "title": "\"How can \"reverse visualization\" help improve our daily activity examination and lead to a concrete daily plan?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author emphasizes the importance of examining our daily activities based on our own consciousness, rather than judgment from the outside world. The exercise of reverse visualization, where we analyze our day backwards, helps us realize the extent to which we were free even if we were unaware of it. The critical analysis of the day should be as thorough as a true confession, guided by a spirit of rectification. The text ends with an examination of the frames of the self in different domains of activity. The last 200 tokens examine the schematic portrayal of various domains and activities, both physical and intellectual.",
  "content": "The critical analysis of the day is as indispensable a tool as the balance sheet, and in any event — for purposes of the method — neither of them has any meaning without the other, so long as, at least, one wants the past to act as teacher of the present. At the initial stage of applying the method, the critical examination must be extremely thorough. It must come out as if it were a true confession, guided by a spirit of rectification rather than one of mere ascertainment of facts. The form assumed by this exam will thus be interrogative in nature. A few schematic annotations will fix the results of such analysis in a stable, standard form. We will lastly move onto the examination of the frames of the self. What we have put up in these frames consists in the schematic portrayal of what might happen to be the object of our activity, both from the physical and from the intellectual, economic, sentimental, family-related and social domains, as well as that activity of ours which is devoted to the fulfilment of pleasures.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the method outlined above encourages a thorough and interrogative critical analysis of one's past behavior, followed by the concrete identification of areas for improvement and the creation of a detailed, expandable daily plan. By embodying specific goals and taking advantage of useful practices while avoiding detrimental ones, individuals can turn their lives into voluntary works and achieve their desired outcomes."
