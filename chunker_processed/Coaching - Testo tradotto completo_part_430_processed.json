  "title": "How does being present help us avoid being trapped in a \"trance\" and overcome conflicts in life?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned that people often live in a \"trance,\" dreaming of an imaginary future without critically analyzing whether they can achieve it. In this final part, the author explores how this phenomenon leads to conflicts and distorted reality. The article highlights the concept of being present and listening without becoming involved as a way to construct a more fulfilling way of living. Finally, the text mentions individuals who perceive things in a uni-dimensional way, leading to negative hallucination and a desire to know who is stronger.",
  "content": "This is also the fountainhead of most conflicts: Every conflict has in fact inward roots, and arises because we cling to what pleases us while rejecting what displeases us. We have two possible ways of confronting those situations: One route is for us to go along with the interlocutor by accommodating his thoughts, while practicing a kind of judo whereby we can steer his strength towards the direction we ourselves desire. This method, however, normally has the effect of denting the mental attitude of that other person. An important alternative key for solving conflicts is to be present. To listen without letting oneself become involved. In that manner, we will direct attention towards a pre-verbal plane which antedates any belief, a plane where it possible to construct a more satisfactory and fulfilling way of living. Role models Many people are perennially caught in the grip of “either one is dominating or he is being dominated”. Such persons distort reality, as they view them purely as uni-dimensional. This process is also termed “negative hallucination”. The individuals who belong to this category want to understand which one is stronger: Are they stronger, or is it the other?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, conflicts often emerge from our attachment to personal preferences and rejection of alternatives. To deal with these situations, we can either accommodate others' views while steering them towards our desired direction or practice presence and listening without getting involved. The latter approach relies on accessing a pre-verbal plane that precedes beliefs, allowing us to construct more fulfilling ways of living. By adopting the role model of a magnetic person, who operates outside the uni-dimensional view of dominating or being dominated, we can influence others positively and promote regression activation that aligns with our goals."
