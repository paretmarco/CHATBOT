  "title": "Why is the False Self unable to heal and overcome the False Core and the Realization of Separation in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of False Core and False Self has been discussed extensively. In this final section, the focus is on the inability of the False Self to heal or overcome the False Core and the Realization of Separation. It is argued that as the False Core and False Self form an inseparable unit, it is impossible to separate one from the other. Many psycho-spiritual schools believe that the False Self compensator is healthier than the False Core, but Quantum Psychology feels that the reverse is true. Attempts to heal or compensate for the False Core only reinforce the False Core-False Self dyad. Instead, an honest acceptance of the False Core is necessary to go beyond it and stabilize awareness.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Every event and attempt to heal and compensate for the False Core is the False Self doing it. In this way, it only re-enforces the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator dyad. People often respond to the False Core by saying, \"If only I didn't feel (fill in the blank), everything would be fine.\" In this way they are always trying to get rid of the False Core structure by overcompensation. For example; in order to handle (fill in the blank), I'll take another lover. I'll make more money and then I won't be the blank). If I have more experiences, then I'll be smart enough and I won't feel (fill in the blank). This attempt to try to get rid of it, heal it, transform it, re-enforces the False Core-False Self's Holographic nature rather than just saying, \"Hey, here's my False Core of (fill in the blank), isn't that interesting? I've organized my whole life around a concept which is not true. How amazing!\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Quantum Psychology principle dictates that attempting to heal or compensate for the False Core only reinforces the False Core Driver-False Self Compensator dyad. Instead, we must embrace our False Core and work with it without the intention of getting rid of it. By doing so, we develop multi-dimensional awareness and realize that our False Core is only a concept, not an undeniable truth."
