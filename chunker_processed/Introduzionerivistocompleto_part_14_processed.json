  "title": "What is Instant Rapport and How Can You Use NLP Techniques for Relationship Improvement?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves deeper into the concept of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), which is an educational process aimed at discovering and improving our strategies for living, working, and relating with others. The author explains that NLP originated from the need to organize our thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and to understand and transform our unconscious programming. The text also mentions the importance of creating rapport with others, using techniques such as mirroring, and emphasizes the role of beliefs and attitudes in limiting our potential. The author encourages readers to adopt a proactive attitude, focus on their goals, and take advantage of the resources inside themselves to live a fulfilling and creative life.",
  "content": "For example, you have definitely once met a person and, not knowing anything about him, have made comments such as: “He is nice; I can feel it in my bones” or “Even though I’ve just met him, we get on well”. This happens when the rapport is triggered spontaneously, therefore, we have two people who unconsciously move their bodies in the same way, have the same gestures, walk alike, which in NLP terms takes the name of “Mirroring” a method that you use when you want to create a rapport. Mirroring is one of the simplest methods and, at the same time, the starting point to putting ourselves on the same level as our interlocutor so as to enter into a positive relationship with him/ her. Not everyone has a personality or mind open enough to immediately enter into harmony with an unknown, maybe because of past experiences or a present state of mind. Therefore, it sometimes takes a long time to accept a calm dialogue with another person. We can, therefore, decide to shorten this time using the mirroring technique and create a positive, emphatic rapport. “It is important to enter into the other’s world, if we want to bring him into ours!!!! !” When you establish that special understanding between two people, one of them will unconsciously and more easily respond in a positive way to the other’s stimulation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, non-verbal communication is an essential tool that we can use to understand our interlocutors' emotions, values, and personality types, regardless of our relationship with them. By using mirroring techniques and identifying the channels through which our interlocutors communicate, we can create positive, empathic rapport quickly. Moreover, understanding the nuances of non-verbal communication can help us avoid conflicts and misunderstandings. Finally, the enneagram can be an effective tool for identifying our interlocutors' personality types and tailoring our communication strategies accordingly. By incorporating all these insights into our communication, we can become more effective listeners, observers, and communicators in all areas of our lives."
