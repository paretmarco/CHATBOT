  "title": "How Does Quantum Psychology Explain Transference and Self-Treatment Based on Childhood Experiences?",
  "first_phrase": "This concluding section of the text delves into the concept of Quantum Psychology and its implications on how individuals handle themselves and others. The author highlights how one's observations of themselves may be influenced by how their parents viewed and treated them in childhood. The text notes that the internalization of a parent's treatment can result in an individual adopting similar behaviors towards themselves. The author shares examples of individuals who have internalized a parent who was abusive and then abused themselves. The text concludes that one's prior state of ESSENCE or I AM before adopting identities never degrades themselves.",
  "content": "It is my view that each person transfers elements of the parents' child care to his own handling of himself as an object (p. 59) (and, hence, observes him or herself through the eyes of Mom and Dad). In other words, how your parents treated and observed you as a child will be internalized and you will treat and observe \"yourself' (actually an age regressed you) the same way they did. I have worked with innumerable people who \"beat themselves up\" for behaving a certain way. In every situation, the client had an \"internalized parent identity\" and a \"beaten child identity.\" They internalized a parent who was abusive, and then abused themselves. An ESSENCE or I AM prior to taking on Identities never beats themselves up. To repeat, \"You will do unto yourself that which was done unto you.\" In the above situation, the infant identifies with the beaten child identity and the abusive parent. The internalized parent then beats up the internalized child.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to be aware of the way our parents' treatment and observation of us as children may impact how we treat and observe ourselves. By recognizing our internalized parent identity and beaten child identity, we can break the cycle of self-abuse and develop a multi-dimensional awareness. Remember, it's not a \"part\" of you that's critical, but an internalized parent identity that you can learn to separate from yourself."
