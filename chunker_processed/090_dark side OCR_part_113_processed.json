  "title": "\"Why do we experience the 'I don't understand' trance with machines? Understanding the inner child's role in our beliefs and behaviors.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the author discusses different styles of inner dialogue and how they form belief systems. The child's experience with mechanics causes frustration, often leading them into a hypnotic \"I don't understand\" trance. The use of hypnotic suggestions can create a frozen trigger that leads to obsessive behaviors. Lastly, the author discusses \"fusion\" where a child fuses with a parental identity and may lose themselves. In the final part of the text, the author explains that when a fused identity is resisted, it creates another inner-child identity, leading to an internal conflict. The author stresses that understanding these inner-child identities and their conflicts can help individuals handle their emotions better.",
  "content": "An observer who creates a child identity which tries and fails at a task several times and hears Dad say, \"This is how you do it,\" can \"become\" or fuse with the Dad and decide, \"I'll be Daddy, and it will all work out.\" Of course, they begin to be so much like Daddy, they can lose themselves. If the child resists Daddy, (rebellious boy), fusion takes place. The experience becomes \"always fighting father.\" This creates Principle II: When a fused identity is resisted, the resisting identity (rebellious boy) must be formed to protect the individual from the fused identity, namely Dad. \"I must resist Dad\" gets created. This appears as the only way an individual can survive. Now you have two inner-child identities fighting one another. One is called \"I' m like Dad,\" the other \"I want to be me\" (rebellious boy). This is experienced as an internal conflict. These two oppos- ing inner-child identities keep the conflict in place.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to avoid internal conflict and the negative effects of transference, it is important to recognize and acknowledge the different inner-child identities within oneself. By embracing and integrating both the fused and resisting identities, individuals can find a sense of balance and cultivate a more authentic and empowered self. Remember, the goal is not to reject parts of oneself, but to work towards harmony and self-acceptance."
