  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the nature of thoughts and images that arise in our consciousness. They suggest that there is a space from which each thought arises and subsides back into. In the last 200 tokens, the author provides an exercise to help us become more aware of this space. The exercise involves watching our thoughts, asking \"Whose thoughts are these?\" and noticing where each thought subsides to. Through this practice, we can develop a deeper understanding of the thinking dimension and learn how to witness our thoughts without judgment.",
  "content": "In the same way, if you slow clown a film strip, what you have is the space between framesâ€”which you could jump through. Thoughts and images appear like a stream of inter-connected consciousness, but actually there is a space from which each one arises and subsides back into. Practice: As thoughts come into your awareness, begin to notice, \"Where does that thought subside to?\" Follow the thought to the space where it subsides. There will be a space and then another thought will arise.WITNESS it. Where does that thought subside to? THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #5 Focus: Each time a thought arises, ask, \"Whose thoughts are these?\" ________________ Chapter Vi Practice: Watch the thoughts that stream through your awareness. Ask yourself, \"Whose thoughts are these?\" Thoughts are always going by from the one mind. For some of them you're saying, \"That's me,\" and for others, \"That's not me.\" Ask, \"Whose thoughts are these?\" You can't control the thoughts you're going to have five or ten minutes from now so why try to control them now?\"",
  "last_phrase": "As you practice observing your thoughts and questioning their origin, remember that you are not just witnessing them, but also exploring the space between each thought where their observer resides. By doing so, you may begin to see that the separation between your thoughts and your true self is not as fixed as you once thought. Keep exploring and observing with curiosity and openness."
