  "title": "\"How can you nurture a relationship with your unconscious and discover opportunities in life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author suggests exercises to establish a relationship with your unconscious mind, such as asking it questions through finger movements and verifying the correlation of your ideas and ideals with yourself. They also suggest developing the faculty of judging things through a single glance and nurturing the spirit of self-contradiction. Lastly, the author discusses discovering opportunities by organizing one's time, which can lead to positive paradigm shifts. This text gives practical advice for enhancing self-awareness and making the most of one's time.",
  "content": "Another useful exercise endowed with the capacity of making you accustomed to establish contact with your own self, is the development of the faculty of judging things through a single glance. The unconscious, in fact, gives the answer prior to the conscious mind doing so. Lastly, an aid to discover truth consists in nurturing the spirit of self-contradiction: If we desire to do something, let us look for justifications to avoid doing them. Conversely, if we are determined to refrain from something, we should search for reasons that will exhort us to engage in it. It is a convenient tool for balancing at once the benefit and harm of any particular matter. We are too often absent-minded: There is not a single thing we might not be able to accomplish better by drawing onto it our undivided deliberate attention. Discovering opportunities By organizing yourselves, you will bring order into your time and you will realize you have at your disposal more time, which will appear to be longer as well 54. This “additional” time is useful for developing opportunities. Opportunities are the reason that enables us to make a positive paradigm shift.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises that promote self-awareness, judgment, and self-contradiction, combined with a focused and organized approach to time management, can lead to the discovery of opportunities and a more fulfilling life. Keep an open mind, be present in the moment, and seek to expand your knowledge and interests to unlock new possibilities."
