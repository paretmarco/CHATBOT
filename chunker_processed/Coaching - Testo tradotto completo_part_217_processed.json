  "title": "How can developing multiple paths and daydreaming lead to materializing something good in life?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of developing multiple paths towards achieving one's dreams. The author advises against creating a single, inflexible plan and recommends the art of dreaming frequently and gladly. By analyzing daring dreams with the same calm as trivial realities, one can traverse different paths and study new combinations. The text also discusses an exercise to rid oneself of negative emotions from the past. In the final 200 tokens, the author suggests that daydreaming is a powerful tool for transcending stages between aspiration and the present. The concept of freeing oneself from the shackles of time is explored through an exercise involving staring at a light and imagining it penetrating inside oneself to form a sphere.",
  "content": "What might be called daydreaming is, after all, nothing other than the faculty of speedily transcending, in one’s imagination, the stages which are interposed between an aspiration, a goal, and the departure point where we are presently located. The spirit of the «daydreamer», as if by some kind of telepathic vision, can discern how he is eventually going to be once he will have reached the desired goal. Freeing time from its shackles One obstacle that a certain type of person might need to confront is the fact that, when he reviews the past and thinks over something again, he might get the impression of being still encumbered by negative emotions which hold him back. Such emotions might in some cases preclude him from perceiving new opportunities. In this connection, the next exercise is very helpful and assists one in ridding himself of the ghosts from his past: Exercise 43 – Stare at a light in front of you. Thirty seconds later, close your eyes and bring them into a state of ocular convergence. Keep on imagining that light penetrates inside you and gathers by the nape, until it manages to give shape to a sphere.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing exercises such as the ocular convergence technique to free ourselves from negative emotions of the past and daydreaming to envision our future selves, we can better plan and execute our life goals. Building a practical and realistic plan starts with understanding our current position and taking actionable steps towards our desired future."
