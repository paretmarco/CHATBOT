  "first_phrase": "In the final section of Chapter IV, the author explores the concept of Nothingness by removing labels from concepts such as energy, space, mass, time, and distance. They then invite readers to practice the \"NOT-I-I\" exercise, where one traces back to their False Core and ultimately experiences the essential qualities of their being. The author asks readers to notice the big emptiness that this False Core floats in and the energy it holds.",
  "content": "[In this Step we use the trigger as a vehicle or starting point to trace back.] Step 2: Trace it back and sit in your False Core just for a moment. Do not believe the False Core but notice it, experience it and observe it simultaneously. (Here we begin to go just a little \"prior\" to it recognizing it is not true nor is it me.) Step 3:Notice what triggered the False Core and trace it back. Go back and forth a few times. Observe this False Core which pulls your whole chain of associations. (Here we develop flexibility, the ability to BE and UNBE the False Core .) Step 4:Now, notice the difference between you and it. (Here \"you\" \"get\" it is not \"you.\") Step 5:Next, go into ESSENCE prior to the False Core and feel its essential qualities. 161 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Step 6:Notice the BIG EMPTINESS that this whole chain of False Core and its associations are floating in. Step 7:Notice the energy that your False Core has.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by following the steps of tracing back and observing your False Core, you can develop flexibility and come to the realization that it is not the true YOU. Appreciating the BIG EMPTINESS and energy that the False Core is made up of, can help you detach from it and recognize the essential qualities of your true self."
