For this reason, to give myself more leeway, and as a way to have the book available sooner to the public, I decided to use the subtitle of The Quantum Psychology Notebooks. This \"took me off the hook\" in trying to produce a manuscript of great literary value, and gave me the possibility of releasing the material sooner, I did not want to go over all of the material in the last five books. I wanted this work to stand on its own, hence the idea of calling the three Volumes notebooks seemed like a good idea.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, The Quantum Psychology Notebooks are a valuable resource for anyone interested in delving deeper into the dimensions of manifestation and developing multi-dimensional awareness. While the three Volumes are designated as notebooks, they offer insightful perspectives and knowledge that can enrich one's personal growth journey. As the author suggests, studying and revisiting the earlier Quantum Psychology Volumes may be beneficial to fully comprehend the concepts presented in this work."
