  "title": "\"How to reach emptiness and dissolve the concept of awareness? A guide to Quantum Psychology principles.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how to go beyond the concept of awareness to reach a state of emptiness or undifferentiated consciousness, according to quantum psychology principles. The last 200 tokens focus on a concluding exercise that helps to acknowledge that the experiencer and the experienced problem are inter-connected and lack independent self-nature. The exercise allows them to disappear or be \"quantumfied\". The text mentions the H.H. Dalai Lama and the concept of emptiness. It also quotes a teacher from India who compared letting go of religion to a pole vaulter who lets go of the pole to reach the other side. The idea of cause and effect is also discussed, mentioning that causation has no inherent existence.",
  "content": "In short, the building of awareness implies that awareness sees things as being made of different substances. To go beyond, one must see them as the same. All psycho-spiritual systems believe in awareness. The concept of awareness too must be gone beyond. Problems can only arise as long as there is an imagined \"I\" who experiences the problem. Once acknowledged, the problem and the experiencer of the problem disappear or are quantumfied. Quantumfied: The process whereby the unity of the experiencER and the experience is recognized. \"It\"—the experiencER-experience then disappears in that EMPTINESS. EXERCISE #17 ________________ Chapter IV dependent and inter-connected, nothing has a separate independent self nature. Once this is grasped, the problem or experience disappears or is quantumfied, Step I: Step II: Step III: Acknowledge the experiencer and the experienced problem as one. Notice that they have neither a separate self-nature nor are they separate from everything else. Allow them to disappear (be quantumfied). CAUSE AND EFFECT On the conventional level there is a path, there is causation. But because causation has no inherent existence—to perceive that causation has inherent existence is ignorance.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to going beyond awareness is to recognize the unity of the experiencer and the experience, which leads to the disappearance or quantumfication of the problem. Follow the steps of acknowledging the oneness of the experiencer and the experience, realizing their lack of inherent existence, and allowing them to disappear. By doing so, you can transcend causation and reach a deeper level of understanding of the self. Remember to notice the \"I\" thought and the knower or experiencer of the thought to achieve this state of being."
