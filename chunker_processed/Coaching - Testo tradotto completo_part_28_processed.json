  "title": "\"What is Erethism and how can Tension and Relaxation help develop your nervous potential?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of maintaining a surplus of available strength to experience the joys of fulfilling physiological needs and achieve optimism. The author explains that the essence of Epicureanism is not in gratification, but in paving the way for enjoyment through the art of understanding and tasting joy. In the last part (200 tokens), the author expands on this idea, emphasizing the importance of grasping the truth that pleasure comes from within ourselves. The text also mentions the concept of erethism, a state of heightened physiological arousal that arises when the body is well-nourished and rested.",
  "content": "Not only the person who fails to see to this surplus for the sake of carrying out a voluntary physiological action deprives himself of all the joys occasioned by the fulfilment of a physiological need, and thus, essentially, of optimism, as the latter consists in a fulfilled exigency; not only he foists on his body a state of muscular and nervous exhaustion stripping him of any energy, but he also hastens briskly towards chronic illness and nervous senility. The essence of Epicureanism did not lie in actualizing gratification. It rather consisted in the art of paving the way for enjoyment. It consisted, in other words, in the ensemble of norms which regulated oneâ€™s knowledge of how to enjoy things and how to understand and taste joy. The first such rule is to grasp the truth that the true source of pleasure is embedded in our own selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, taking care of our physiological needs not only brings us joy and optimism but also prevents chronic illness and nervous senility. The essence of Epicureanism lies in the art of understanding how to enjoy things, and tension and relaxation are keys to developing our nervous potential and personal magnetism. Remember that the true source of pleasure is within ourselves, and by practicing these techniques, we can increase our neuric strength and influence in various aspects of our lives."
