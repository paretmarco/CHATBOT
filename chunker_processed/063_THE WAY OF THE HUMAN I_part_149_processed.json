  "title": "How does identifying with our thoughts limit our experiences in life?",
  "first_phrase": "In this contemplative passage, the author discusses the nature of thoughts and their impermanence. The author explains that identifying with thoughts and emotions can lead to limiting experiences. Hence, the purpose of this practice is to bring you back to the space between two thoughts, to understand who is the knower of \"your\" thoughts. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares a personal experience of working with a married couple in a workshop.",
  "content": "If a thought comes by that says, \"I don't understand,\" you identify with it and then begin a chain of associations like \"I don't understand,\" \"I never understood anything,\" \"This is my story.\" But anything you identify yourself with as \"I\" will limit you. The nature of the mind is to always change its mind; that's why one minute you like your job, the next you don't. One minute you like your relationship, the next you don't. One day you're really happy with the course of your life, the next day you're not. If you fall in love today, tomorrow you won't like the person so much. Therefore, you can't depend on your thoughts. And so there is no answer to the question, \"From where does this thought arise.\" But notice what happens if you ask that question 86 Chapter VI and look for the space from which each thought arises The thing to remember isâ€”who is the knower of \"your\" thoughts (to be discussed in Volume III). I once worked with a married couple in a workshop.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to remember that identifying oneself with thoughts can limit us, as our minds are prone to changing their opinions constantly. By stepping back and realizing that we are not our thoughts, we can free ourselves from this cycle. Asking where a thought arises from can also help us understand our minds better. Ultimately, recognizing ourselves as the knower of our thoughts can lead to a greater sense of clarity and peace."
