  "title": "What is Karma Theory and how does it help to maintain order in Indian society?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Karma Theory, which originated in Asia and states that what you sow, so shall you reap. It helped to organize the chaos and maintain order in Indian society, where 99% of the wealth is owned by less than 1% of the population. It prevented the poor from overthrowing the rich by spiritualizing pain and dulling the frustration and chaos that might cause people to demand their rights and make a change. The last 200 tokens discuss the spiritualizations of pain through the lens of super trance-personal spiritualizations, which involve rationalizations like \"God works in mysterious ways\" and \"I will get my reward in another life.\"",
  "content": "Karma Theory Spiritualizations: \"It is my Karma from my past life that I' m balancing; that' s why I'm in pain\" (I didn't get what I wanted). Here, in order for the child to find a way to make sense out of a need unfulfilled, she trance-fers a system to organize the discomfort and chaos. Children do not understand why their needs are not being fulfilled. This is re- enforced culturally in Asia and, in Western cultures, by spiritualization. It is an opiate to dull the frustration and chaos that might cause people to demand their rights and make a change. Below is another form of spiritualizing pain I call super trance- personal spiritualizations. Review of Super Trance-personal Spiritualization Rationalizations 1. When you don't get what you want, \"God/parents has other things in mind for me, higher purposes.\" 2. When things seem chaotic, \"God works in mysterious ways.\" 3. When you're good and don't get rewarded, \"I will get my reward for being good in another life,\" or \"They will get their punishment in another life, for being bad now.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while spiritualizing pain and discomfort may offer a temporary escape from the chaos of unfulfilled needs, it ultimately perpetuates a cycle of passivity and resignation. Instead of relying on karma or super trance-personal spiritualizations, it is important to acknowledge and address our needs and take necessary steps to fulfill them in the present moment, rather than waiting for some distant reward or punishment in another life or dimension."
