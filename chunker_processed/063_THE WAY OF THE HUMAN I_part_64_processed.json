  "title": "\"What are uncooked seeds in Quantum Psychology, and how do they hinder spiritual transcendence?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses how many people use meditation as medication to avoid feeling their psychological material, resulting in spiritual denial. The author introduces the concept of uncooked seeds as a metaphor for unprocessed psychological material or False Core-False Self. The author then explains how gurus in India meditate and live in essence, but when they come to the West, their False Core-False Self kicks in and their uncooked seeds sprout. The author explains how these gurus use spiritual denial techniques to justify their actions, leading to a contradiction.",
  "content": "In this way Quantum Psychology cooks the uncooked seeds of your psychology in the fry- ing pan of awareness so that they can no longer sprout and bear fruit. Now, in India you have gurus meditating their brains out, sitting somewhere in ESSENCE, I AM NOT-I-I, etc. most of the ________________ Chapter II time. Whenever they need anything on a personal level, it is taken care of. If they're hungry, people bring food, if their clothes are dirty, people clean them. Then, they come to America or Western Europe. The context (external dimension) changes and their False Core-False Self kicks in causing their uncooked seeds to sprout. Soon they get into money, sex, creating meditation centers, etc. To explain this contradiction to their followers, bigger and better spiritual denial techniques have to be employed. For example, sex is no longer sex, it is tantra; seeking fame and money is not seeking fame and money, it is having a calling or a mission from God. Soon they wind up on the front cover of Yoga Journal! They have not acknowledged their False Core-False Self (uncooked seeds).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you want to truly cultivate awareness and prevent your unacknowledged False Core-False Self from taking control of your actions and thoughts, it is essential to utilize the principles of Quantum Psychology to fry these uncooked seeds in the pan of awareness. Only then can you experience true transformation and prevent your uncooked seeds from sprouting and causing you to lose touch with your inner self."
