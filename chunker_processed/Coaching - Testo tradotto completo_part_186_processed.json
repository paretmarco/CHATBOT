  "title": "\"How Can Visualization and Developing Intuition Improve Your Business Strategies?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the power of visualization and imagination in expanding one's personal and professional horizons, as well as how to nurture these skills. The author emphasizes the importance of looking beyond one's usual range of interests and learning to read the signs which the Universe transmits to individuals. The last 200 tokens describe two exercises to help develop visualization and intuition, including withdrawing into a half-lit room to visualize and looking at a reflected light in order to find inspiration. These exercises are meant to help individuals cultivate an \"inner sight\" and avoid making gross mistakes.",
  "content": "You must learn, in your surroundings, the signs which the Universe transmits to your persons, as well as the directions which open up in front of you with their peculiar vistas. Exercise 36 – Visualization Withdraw into a room, possibly a half-lit one, relax, and make sure you visualize a vivid picture of whatever your reflection happens to concentrate upon. Even though, the first times you carry out this exercise, it might seem as if you are reaping no results from it, creative ideas will gradually surface around you, and you will eventually end up acquiring a kind of «inner sight», such that it will be likely to rescue you from falling into gross mistakes. You might subsequently empower these sessions further by looking at the mirror thanks to the “reflected light”. Exercise 37 – Developing intuition by recourse to the mirror While you are in the same environment as the one referred to in the previous exercise, look for 30 seconds at a light (max. 75 watts) 47 which is reflected in a mirror, in so doing thinking of the subject matter concerning which you would like to find some inspiration.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning to recognize the signs and opportunities that the universe presents to us is a valuable skill to have. Exercises such as Visualization and Developing Intuition through the mirror can help us develop our inner sight and access our creativity. By incorporating these practices into our daily lives, we can become more aware and receptive to the world around us and gain insights that can lead us to success."
