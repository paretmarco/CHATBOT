  "title": "How can we nourish our souls and achieve our goals with sincerity and truthfulness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the importance of nourishing our soul and the value of having aspirations and dreams. This last part focuses on the process of achieving what we want in life. The text gives us two important points to consider: first, knowing precisely what we want, and second, ensuring that it is possible to achieve it. It emphasizes the need to visualize our goals concretely, as well as the uselessness of striving for something that is impossible. By following these two principles, we can align our actions with our desired outcomes and ensure that we make the most of our potential.",
  "content": "Such a question might seem to be strange. Let us therefore hasten at once to elucidate its very important meaning. Every situation in our life is the product of a particular manner in which we relate to time. 1. Knowing what one wants. – One often thinks he knows what he actually wants, and yet his ideal is too imprecise or fluctuating, or else it does not conform to his real being. Other people go even as far as to confuse “wanting” with “desiring”. One cannot set his look on something devoid of a body, for otherwise the result would be null. We should consider that wanting entails for us an action. We must therefore get used to capture what we want to will in some picture which embodies it concretely. 2. The possibility of accomplishing what one wants. – It is useless to will something impossible: Our very being will be alert to such impossibility, by refusing to produce an effort it already knows to be futile. Put it in other words, our unconscious would spontaneously tend to debar us from wasting energy in vain. Willing is only based on having the capacity to do.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, when it comes to achieving what we want in life, it's crucial to have a clear and concrete picture of our desires, consider whether they are possible, and approach them with sincerity and truthfulness. By doing so, we can better align ourselves with our true being and increase our chances of success in any situation. Remember, wanting entails action, and believing in our own capacity to achieve is the first step towards realizing that desire."
