  "title": "How does the idealization of others relate to developmental stages, and why do some people look for a model in others, such as therapists?",
  "first_phrase": "This passage explores the idealization of others by narcissists and how it can be conceptualized along a developmental continuum. The author discusses three types of transference - merger, twinship, and mirroring - and how they relate to seeking a perfect object or role model. In the last 200 tokens, the author reflects on their experiences with trainees who look for a model of how to be, and how this is not necessarily helpful in discovering one's own identity and approach to therapy. The author emphasizes that being a therapist does not require being a model, but rather being true to oneself.",
  "content": "Simply put, they have collapsed the levels and are age-regressed, trying to find a model of how to be. For example, recently a former trainee of mine said to me, \"You are my model of how to do therapy.\" Another trainee watching me do a Quantum process in a workshop said that I \"modeled the state.\" 221 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness I said to both trainees, \"I am not a model for how to do therapy, nor do I model a state of consciousness. I do therapy as I do therapy, and the state I'm in is not a modeling but rather just who I am and where I am at the moment.\" But people age-regress and look for models or formulas of how to be or do, imagining that when they model in this way, they can get the same or similar results, rather than discovering who they are in life and doing therapy from who they are. Therapists often imply that they are, or they should be, a model.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to realize that seeking models or formulas of how to be is an age-regressed behavior that can lead to reinforcing false identities. Instead, discovering who we are in life and doing things from our authentic self is the path towards multi-dimensional awareness and growth, whether it is in therapy or in everyday life."
