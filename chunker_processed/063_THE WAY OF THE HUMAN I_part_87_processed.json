  "title": "How can Quantum Psychology help us go beyond the False Core-False Self complex to realize our true identity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text mentioned the concept of False Core, False Self, and the Observer complex in shaping our psychology. This complex limits our volitional choice, and without realizing it, we fixate on it, preventing us from finding out who we really are. In this last part, the author introduces a method of waking up from this limitation: through inquiry and exercises on the concept of I-dentity. Identities like \"I love myself\" or \"I am happy in a relationship\" are evaluated, questioned, and investigated. This approach aims to help us realize that we are not our False Core, False Self, or Observer complex, ultimately finding freedom for ourselves.",
  "content": "It would be like thinking, \"I am my car,\" and then thinking that if I buy a new car, it will change who I am. The Observer-False Core Driver-False Self Compensator complex represents and organizes everything you call yourself, i.e., your entire psychology. But to paraphrase Idries Shah: \"You can only be free if you develop volitional choice over where you put your awareness.\" Quantum Psychology says, \"You cannot do this if you are unknowingly habitually fixated on the False Core, the compensating False Self or the 42 Chapter Observer. Waking up is realizing that you are not the observer-False Core-False Self complex. THE APPROACH The approach is through enquiry and exercises sometimes done with others. It's an ongoing enquiry into what I call I-dentity. Identities can be anything: I am or I (fill in the blank). \"I love myself,\" \"I hate myself,\" \"I am happy I am in a relationship,\" \"I am miserable I am in la relationship.\" All of these are I-dentities.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the practice of Quantum Psychology involves an ongoing inquiry into one's identity, dismantling false core beliefs and self-compensation through exercises and internalization of the process. Ultimately, the goal is to gain volitional choice over one's awareness and to realize that the observer, false core, and false self complex are not who you are. By doing so, you can free yourself from these limiting notions and live a more authentic life."
