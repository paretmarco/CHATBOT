  "title": "\"What is the art of living fully and how does it relate to professional work and economic aspirations?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text urges us to understand the art of productivity, and how it is crucial to delegate tasks to subordinates to focus on more significant goals. The author emphasizes the importance of always reaching for higher levels of productivity and organization to achieve a fulfilling life. The final part emphasizes the significance of daily progress and conscious awareness to make work enjoyable and light. It concludes with a powerful reminder that whoever dies without having given everything, has lived in vain.",
  "content": "We have to do that in order to manage activity as wisely as possible, and the wisest way, indeed, coincides with the bravest one. True, whoever walks might even stumble, and yet he moves forward; as for the one who is stuck to his seat, he will always find himself in exactly the same place, without ever advancing, and will become fed up with his immutable place, whether it is a heap of litter or a comfortable couch. Even professional activity can — and in fact should — be considered as if it represented one single and progressively evolving task leading to an ultimate goal, which should be as lofty as possible, ennobled by one’s ideal, and kept alive by the concrete interest one has in attaining it. Daily life, in that event, would no longer be the same throughout, and will rather signal a progress compared to the work of the day before and a prefatory step towards the one of the following day. The conscious awareness of creating something useful or pleasant must always be infixed in our mind, as it would thereby make work cheerful and light.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to managing professional activity wisely is to have clear and lofty goals that are fueled by our ideals and interests. By infusing our work with a conscious awareness of creating something useful or pleasant, we can find joy in even the most tedious tasks. And while money may not guarantee happiness, achieving our economic aspirations can positively contribute to our overall sense of well-being."
