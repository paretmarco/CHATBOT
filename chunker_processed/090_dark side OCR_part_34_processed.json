  "title": "\"How can understanding the inner child help individuals and therapists achieve present-time awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of \"The Beginning of the End of Inner Child\" by Penny Parks, the author discusses the dark side of the wounded child identity and how it becomes our nemesis, shrinking our present-time world. She explains that trance is defined as \"wakeful sleep\" and is a response to interactions with other people, particularly in childhood. Parks integrates Western psychotherapy, Eastern philosophy, and quantum physics to help individuals and therapists deconstruct the inner child and return to the source of their experiences. This book is a valuable resource for understanding the inner child and strategies for overcoming its negative effects.",
  "content": "We are stuck with a window through which we are seeing the world, or better yet, not seeing the present-time world. The dark side of the wounded child 1-dentity becomes our nemesis, when it 20 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child shrinks the observers' present-time world, making it look like a past-time experience. In other words, the observer goes to sleep, and unknowingly looks through the inner child world view. Trance can be defined as wakeful sleep. In the beginning trance occurs through a series of interactions with other people like Mom, Dad, a teacher, and even a boss, friends, husbands, wives, children, etc. The trance you designed had a purpose to maintain, protect, or support you as a child. The trance became an automatic response to other people, and developed an autonomy of its own. Stated another way, a child relates to the family in a particular way. This is the trance the child uses in that family.",
  "last_phrase": "To break free from the trance of the dark side of the inner child, we must awaken from our slumber and see the present world through a new window. We need to recognize and address our automatic responses that stem from past experiences and allow ourselves to experience situations as they are, not as we remember them. By doing so, we can expand our focus and move towards greater comfort and fulfillment."
