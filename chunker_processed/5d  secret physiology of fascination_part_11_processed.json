  "title": "How does difficulty with arousal levels affect sensory processing and vision?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed how people with high or low arousal levels may struggle to regulate their arousal levels and respond strongly to sensory stimuli. We also explored how myopia can be accentuated in monocular vision and how convergence and divergence help combat blur. In this final section, we'll delve into the Mandelbaum effect, which reveals that a vertical target captures more attention than a flat target, as well as a new method called luciow, which involves putting your subject in front of a light and holding their hands.",
  "content": "Also convergence could be more difficult RELATIVE ACCOMODATION The change in accomodation inserting a lens while mantaining clarity is called relative accomodation CONVERGENCE, DIVERGENCE AND BLUR Convergence and divergence are in part an answer to the blur So, if we increase the blur without effectively changing convergence, as when we look for some time an object, we depotentiate the accomodative response VERTICAL HAND COMPARED TO FLAT HAND A vertical target seem to influence the Mandelbaum effect and captures more the attention as a flat target. Therefore a flat hand can be useful for helping a person going in his dark focus more than a vertical hand, even if in both cases the subject feel the hand pointing at him Another fascination method (luciow) Put your subject in face of a light. Take the hands of your subject in your hands while your subject look at you.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, understanding the concepts of relative accommodation, convergence, divergence, and diploplia are crucial for improving our visual perception. Utilizing techniques like flat hands or the luciow method can aid in achieving better focus, but it's important to note that movement can make one's position uncertain. By keeping these principles in mind, we can enhance our ability to see the world around us."
