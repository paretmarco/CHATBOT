  "title": "What is the connection between body awareness and biological spirituality in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the holographic nature of the body and images. He introduces the Quantum Psychology Principle to handle image or emotional problems and to unfixate and free our habitually fixated awareness, which enhances body awareness and speeded-up re-education. The author also talks about integrating the older and newer brain and achieving biological spirituality through the realization of the spinal connection to the cerebral cortex and beyond. Lastly, he mentions Ida Rolf's view of psychology as a biploar core and breakages in balance.",
  "content": "If there is an emotional problem, handle it at the emotional dimension. What Quantum Psychology has noticed is that when images are dismantled the BIOLOGICAL CORE, like ESSENCE becomes more available. Why? Because the interference patterns, or habitually fixated awareness, is unfixated and free. This allows body awareness and its re-education to be greatly enhanced and speeded-up. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The realization of this spinal connection up and through the spine to the cerebral cortex and beyond ignites the realization of biological spirituality (i.e., the grounded experience that the body too is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE). INTEGRATING THE OLDER WITH THE NEWER BRAIN To integrate this awareness: Step I: Notice a thought you are having. Step II: Follow or trace it down to the non-verbal sensation level in the lower brain (spine). Step III: Take a deep breath and take it down into the lower spine (lower brain); the no-state silent level. Step IV: Notice what happens. PSYCHOLOGY'S CREATION Ida Rolf saw the core as bipolar, with poles at the lower and upper cores, and that breakages in the balance create \"psychology.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Quantum Psychology emphasizes the importance of dismantling habitual thought patterns and establishing a spinal connection to enhance body awareness and achieve biological spirituality. By following simple steps to trace thoughts down to the non-verbal sensation level, we can integrate awareness and attain alignment with the gravitational pull of the earth and sun. Handling emotional problems at the emotional dimension can also aid in this process. Taking these principles into account can greatly benefit our psychological well-being and spiritual growth."
