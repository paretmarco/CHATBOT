  "title": "What are the International Academic Euroasiatic Network and the Magnetic Path?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author outlines various paths and certifications available through their International Academic Euroasiatic Network for research. The text delves into the concept of the \"magnetic chain\" and the importance of working together in a group to develop inner memory. The author also discusses the various practices and exercises involved in their approach to magnetism, including mesmerism, fascination, and non-verbal communication techniques. The text emphasizes the importance of personal growth and development in conjunction with learning these techniques, and offers a variety of paths for individuals to explore.",
  "content": "In quantum terms the “magnetic chain” is an entanglement between the members of a group. In fact we observe certain phenomena when more persons work together on some issue. These effects have been also studied and labeled as “morphic field”: \"The morphic fields include all kinds of organizing fields...: The organizing fields of animal and human behaviour, of social and cultural systems, and of mental activity can all be regarded as morphic fields which contain an inherent memory.\" According to the essential uses, customs and traditions of Magnetism and most particular Hermetic orders, which have been scrupulously preserved by our lineage, a recognized branch has the power to make and develop teaching about magnetism, according to the lineages that we preserve and all groups that continue them are inside the so called \"magnetic chain\" and are to be considered as regular and develop this “inner memory”. There are some specific points that are set for a group to be considered as regular in working with magnetism: 1 - not taking political or religious dogmatic point of view 2 - preserve and study the tradition respecting it and staying obviously in the lineage 3 - develop the work of presence 4 - divulge with respect to the discipline and of the other fellows practitioners 5 - adhere to the vaster group Mesmerismus ® -Magnetic Path First step of Magnetic Path Secrets of magnetic inductions The word Mesmerismus ® means connecting the forces of nature to his work and to his influence. Having these forces available, in creating the plan of his life, everyone can aim for the top.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Magnetic Path offers a unique opportunity to study and develop personal magnetism, as well as explore the fascinating world of mesmerism and quantum physics. The courses cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of magnetism to advanced techniques like fascination and quantum presence. By adhering to the principles of the Magnetic Chain and respecting the lineage of the Hermetic orders, participants can become certified magnetists and operators of magnetic massage. The techniques and concepts taught in these courses can lead to personal and professional success, as well as a deeper understanding of human consciousness and its relationship to the implicate order."
