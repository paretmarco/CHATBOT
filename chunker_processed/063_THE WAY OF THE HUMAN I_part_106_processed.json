  "title": "\"What is Anthropomorphism and Why Should It Be Avoided in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding section of \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the false core and false self compensator are explained as mere psycho-emotional abstractions that need to be surpassed. The author emphasizes that maps are made by people, and Quantum Psychology is one such map that is not the territory. The goal of developing multi-dimensional awareness is to find out who you are ultimately. Through this realization, one can reach a state where the \"you\" disappears, leaving only the interconnected whole of the \"I AM,\" the underlying unity or VOID. Nisargadatta Maharaj's quote highlights that personality is a mistaken identity.",
  "content": "ESSENCE, the I AM, the underlying unity or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS 55 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is the goal and the \"how to\" is the finger (in this case Quantum Psychology) must be \"gone beyond\" as well. The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out Who You Are. Ultimately the enquirER-enquirEE and the WHO AM I along with Quantum Psychology dissolve. The probability of that occurring might \"hopefully\" be enhanced by developing multi-dimensional awareness and by going beyond how you fixate your awareness on your False Core-False Self but there are no guarantees. Finally, it might be that through the liberation of your fixated awareness that ESSENCE, the \"I AM,\" the underlying unity or VOID might become more realizable. At that point, the \"you\" \"you\" think you are disappears, and only THAT ONE INDIVISIBLE SUBSTANCE remains. The realization that it is all one interconnected whole, that there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE that everything is made out of, and even BEYOND this—and \"I AM THAT\"—is pure (no subject-object) spirituality. personality is a mis-taken identity. Nisargadatta Maharaj Chapter 11 Enjoy the ride!",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the ultimate goal of developing multi-dimensional awareness and utilizing tools such as Quantum Psychology is to move beyond fixation on the False Core-False Self and discover the essence of our true selves. This realization leads to understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the pure spirituality of being. So, enjoy the ride with love, and continue on the Way of the Human towards discovering the answer to the timeless question of \"Who Am I?\""
