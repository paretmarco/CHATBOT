  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text discusses the healing process of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa, specifically his technique of Instant Fascination which has the ability to relieve physical pains and various ailments. The text also delves into the psychological mechanisms that create negative fascination and how fascination can induce a state of void to allow for spontaneous self-reorganization. The last section includes a discussion on three simple exercises to develop magnetic power and to control one's nerves and thoughts. These practices can greatly benefit one's health and aid with insomnia, neurosis, or amnesia.",
  "content": "Thereafter, hold the air you have thus inhaled for a few seconds, and breathe it out slowly. This exercise should be carried out as slowly as you can. You will interrupt the exercise three or four times by switching to your normal mode of breathing. This exercise has the effect of de-congesting the «solar plexus», which is the hub of all kinds of emotions and impulses. After some ten days or so, timidity and dejection shall disappear. 2. In the event that you are jolted by sudden noises, such as the ring of the telephone, you should get used to control your nerves every moment of your day, and repress every unconscious motion of yours, staying still so as to prevent the nervous movement of your legs, avoiding gestures as you talk, etc. The present exercise results in you conferring order on your nervous forces, thereby averting dissipations which are harmful to the organism. 3. Daily strive, for a quarter of an hour, to focus your thought on one thing only by consciously excluding any other one. Etch firmly in your mind the fact that the aforesaid preparatory work has been rationally studied and combined in such a way as to enable the deep development of your hypnotic abilities. Nothing is achieved without effort. The training demands an amount of self-straining, but at the end your endeavours shall be crowned by success. This second series of three exercises is beneficial to one’s health. It will greatly avail whoever suffers from insomnia, neurosis or amnesia.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by incorporating these three sets of exercises into your daily routine, you can improve your overall well-being, overcome fears and anxiety, and develop a magnetic look and confident speaking. Remember that consistency and effort are key to achieving success, and that each exercise should be approached with patience and dedication. With time, you can enjoy the benefits of improved circulation, better endurance, and a stronger mind-body connection. So go ahead and give these exercises a try, and take the first step towards a healthier and happier life."
