  "title": "\"How do uncooked seeds affect the spiritualization of gurus and meditation practice?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of this text, the author talks about uncooked seeds, which will sprout out when put back into a relationship or world that helps them grow. Unfortunately, most teachers or gurus spiritualize their uncooked seeds, including their desire for money, sex, and fame. In this last section, the author narrates a Sufi story to emphasize how external contexts bring up uncooked seeds. Each new context yields different uncooked seeds. The author also notes how the nervous system contains an associational trance that serves as a defense mechanism against unpleasant external factors. The last 200 tokens present a practical example of a client with a non-existent sexual relationship with her husband.",
  "content": "Nasudin came out of the house, saw this and began to beat the goat with a stick. A man passing by yelled at Nasudin, \"Stop, how can you beat a poor defenseless goat'?\" Nasudin replied \"I am not the doer, God does everything, I do nothing.\" The passerby fell to his knees, touching Nasudin's feet. \"Oh I am so sorry, I did not realize you were an enlightened saint, please forgive me. By the way,\" the passerby continued, \"This is a .beautiful garden, who made such a beautiful garden?\" Nasudin replied \"I DID.\" The external context brings up your uncooked seeds. Each new context will yield different uncooked seeds. It should be noted that the nervous system contains an associational trance which has a scanning-searching-seeking device which has a generalizing tendency which serves as a survival mechanism of the nervous system, which makes the past into the present and represents a major defense against an unpleasant external which can bring up unwanted or denied uncooked seeds. For example, I saw a client whose sexual relationship with her husband was non-existent.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve true liberation of awareness and become dehypnotized, it's important to recognize and address our psychological and emotional issues. Only then can we reach a state of meditation and fully realize that we are not what we think we are. By doing so, we can avoid falling into the trap of the associational trance of the nervous system and prevent unwanted, denied uncooked seeds from resurfacing."
