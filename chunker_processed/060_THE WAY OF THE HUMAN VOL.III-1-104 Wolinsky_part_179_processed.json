  "first_phrase": "In this text on The Way of the Human and Beyond Quantum Psychology, we are reminded that there is no separate self and that the concept of a self exists only in thought. By performing exercise #26, readers may notice that the perceiver is contained within the perception, and there is just perceiving. To truly understand this, one must look for the looker and realize that there is none there. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the idea that the answer is within and that \"it\" is inside of you (the VOID).",
  "content": "Notice that the perceiver is contained within the perception, and that there is no separate perceiver of the object, just perceiving. 1. Without using your thoughts, memory, emotions associations or perceptions, is the personality appearing within you (as VOID) form, formless or neither. 2. Without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions, is there really a personality or just these thoughts, memory, emotions, sensations, associations and perceptions floating in and out of you (the VOID)? The following ideas have been taught for centuries. Such statements as, \"The answer is within,\" \"It is inside of you, LOOK within.\" This \"you\" however, is not the \"I\" or the body, it is the VOID. \"It is within you\" (the VOID), \"The kingdom of Heaven is within you\" 176 Chapter IV (THE VOID), God dwells within you as you (the VOID) (see Chapter V, The Nameless Absolute). This can best be appreciated by looking for the looker and realizing there is none there. In other words the looker or see-er and the seen are one.",
  "last_phrase": "To truly know yourself, you must turn your attention inward and realize the \"you\" is the VOID. By looking for the looker and realizing there is none there, you can see that the perceiver is contained within the perception. Remember to notice who wants to know and know the knower."
