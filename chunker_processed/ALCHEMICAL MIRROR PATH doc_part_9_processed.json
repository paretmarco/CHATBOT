  "title": "What is Mirror Gazing and the Four Stages of Climbing into Higher Consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text explore the different stages of working with mirrors in order to achieve different levels of consciousness. The text mentions different physical and etheric phenomena that occur during the practice, including the ability to develop visions and recall past events. The author also highlights the importance of never losing consciousness and always maintaining a sense of clarity while practicing. The final stage involves the liberation of one's sulfur, leading to the joining of the body of fire and air with the body of water. The text emphasizes that this is a difficult and dangerous path, but the rewards are great for those who persist and overcome the trials.",
  "content": "The vision of the more or less rapid varying degrees of lights and colours ends with the perception of a complete darkness where the conscience of the operator seems. to dissolve. DREAMS If the individual is capable to persist, and not to retract, and even intensify the strength of the experiment, then, gradually, in absolute darkness one may be able to see of forming a small slight bright center. This will gradually shine until it will take over the dark. So a wonderful new world will open up to the human perception that if it can be satiated by many splendours and magnificent things, must also stay firm, impassible before the monstruosities and horrors without a name that you could see. CONTINUING THE PATH But the trials and dangers have not stopped, the goal is still far away and the path becomes increasingly difficult. Hallucinations of many types could be seen and we transcend near a dream world, but we must absolutely not fall inside it. Other observations of a more profound and interior level need to be done, especially noting a vague feeling of vertigo already slightly experienced in earlier stages. The operator must in the first steps fight it and dominate it, then at a succesive step a change of perception will be necessary, and the only possibility is to let it be there to persist and being beyond it. Feeling it in a slight and barely noticeable way. This requires that the will operates in a very particular way, maintaining a sense of power and passivity, a sense of firm and tenacious immobility.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the path to reaching higher states of consciousness and initiation is not an easy one. It requires persistence, intense training, and the ability to overcome fear and vertigo. The journey starts with small exercises, such as basic cleaning and improving the relationship between the male and female energies within oneself. Through intense concentration, the practitioner will experience different stages, including lucid dreaming, projection of a new self, and astral travel. The ultimate goal is to reach the I-not I state, where one finds the true essence of oneself. This journey requires a combination of willpower, passivity, and a sense of firm immobility, but it is an incredible journey that leads to a profound understanding of oneself and the universe."
