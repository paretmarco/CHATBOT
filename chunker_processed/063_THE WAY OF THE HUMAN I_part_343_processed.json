  "title": "\"What is the Impact of Age Regression and Misunderstanding on Spiritual Trance and Narcissism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the disciples' misinterpretation of the guru's teachings about SELF AS THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and the guru's reluctance to relinquish their narcissistic sense of attention. Preceding this, the author recounts their experience with a famous body therapist who took on her teacher's identity. She was an excellent teacher, but had never internalized the teachings. The author then opines on the mirror trance, as explained by Stephen Johnson, and the desire for role models. Overall, the text explores the role of idealization and developmental arrest in the guru-disciple relationship.",
  "content": "Stephen Johnson (1987) says it this way: In defense of that state, the narcissistic personality will go to extreme lengths to find mirroring objects or to coerce those he has into the desired response. The idealization of others which narcissists exhibit may be usefully conceptualized along the developmental continuum—merger, twinship, mirroring. In the merger transference, the individual will seek out and then rnispercieve the other as the perfect object with whom to merge. In ordinary life this perfection is most often sought in the potential mate—potential because it is nearly impossible to maintain idealization at close quarters. The individual is still looking for the symbiosis which was either insufficient or prematurely lost. (This is one phase of the guru/disciple trance which is the spiritualization of the mother). The perfect twin-ship is the idealization of the alter-ego transference, as seen in many adolescent love affairs. The perfect role model is the idealization of the mirroring transference. In this later developmental arrest, the individual needs someone to look up to, believe in, and emulate. (p. 52) LOOKING FOR A MODEL. Throughout my life, I have found both friends and trainees of mine who were looking for a role model.",
  "last_phrase": "It's natural to look up to role models, but it's important to remember that each person's journey is unique, and comparisons may limit growth. Embrace your individuality and let your experiences guide you towards being the best version of yourself."
