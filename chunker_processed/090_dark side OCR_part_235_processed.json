  "title": "\"What is Left-Handed Shaktipat and its Damaging Effects on Couples, Spiritualizing Guru's Behavior?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the topic of age-regression by a Guru and the damage it causes to individuals and couples was discussed. The concept of left-handed shaktipat was introduced, where a Guru initiates a married couple and then tries to have a sexual relationship with the wife. Unfortunately, the Guru's behavior is often spiritualized instead of being confronted as the trance of a perpetrator. In this last section, the topic turns to spiritual lessons and how they are taught through rewards and punishments. The author examines the impact of this lesson-teaching model on individuals and their perception of God. This discussion sets the stage for a deeper examination of the power dynamics at play in spiritual relationships.",
  "content": "Gener- ally speaking parents give a reason for rewards or punishments. For example, a child who does what is suggested by Mom and Dad gets rewarded, now or in the future. Children who don't do what parents tell them are punished now or in the future. If our previous discussion is correct, and we make our parents into gods who are trying to teach us lessons, let us look at the possible outcomes. A child is rewarded for learning the lesson of cleaning his room. Another child is punished by parents for not learning the lesson. When the child is asked, \"Why am I being punished?\" parents say, because you need to learn lessons. Years later in school, a similar model of rewards and punish- ments is fused with the concept of lessons. For example if I learn my arithmetic lesson, I'm rewarded. If I don' t, I'm punished (have to do Spiritualizing â€¢ 145 extra homework). What impact could occur in the future. \"If I am good, God gives me more things\" (bliss, money, good relationship, etc.) because I learned my lesson.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to understand that while parents may use rewards and punishments to teach children valuable lessons, this approach can lead to a flawed belief system that good behavior guarantees good outcomes and bad behavior results in bad outcomes. We must recognize that life is not always so straightforward, and that the lessons we learn are not always tied to rewards or punishments. It is up to us to break free from this mindset and embrace a more nuanced understanding of the world around us."
