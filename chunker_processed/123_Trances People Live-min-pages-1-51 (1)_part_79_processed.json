  "title": "\"How can a Deep Trance Phenomenon help interrupt symptoms and aid in therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the approach of inducing a Deep Trance Phenomenon as a therapeutic method is discussed. This approach works by allowing the already occurring trance state to fully manifest and then working with it. The purpose is to depotentiate habitual frames of reference, enabling the patient to cope with certain inner and outer realities. The last 200 tokens specifically highlight the need to focus on the person rather than their problem, identifying limitations and facilitating a new and different clinical experience. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of addressing the underlying trance state to dissipate symptoms.",
  "content": "Because of the limitations of a pat lent 's habitual frames of reference, his usual everyday consciousness cannot cope with certain inner and/or outer realities, and the patient recognizes he has a \"problem.\" Depotentiating a patient's usual everyday conscious sets is thus a way of depotentiating facets of his personal limita- tions (p. 448) 6 Craning Context: You Are Not Your Problem Tii, ltECIINNING STACIE t4 th-.:tdr! ittt MIN problem or mi,4,,,, ■ , tviiiiivi, the person to thii4ePtiiiv (runt the prrActutrig ,„,/‹.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, depotentiating a patient's usual everyday conscious sets is a powerful way to break down personal limitations that can hinder their ability to cope with certain inner and/or outer realities. Through therapy, patients can learn to observe and describe their problems rather than being consumed and controlled by them, ultimately gaining the ability to move beyond their misidentifications and fear of intimacy towards a happier, more fulfilling life."
