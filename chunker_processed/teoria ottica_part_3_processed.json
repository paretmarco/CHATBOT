  "title": "How can we manipulate reality through the power of gaze and fascination?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we explored the power of the gaze and how it can impact the way we perceive reality. We learned that the way we see things shapes our subjective experience of the world. Now, let's delve deeper into the topic of fascination and magnetic influence. Dr. Paret and Dr. Max Tira are the leading experts in this field, having learned the techniques from ancient Italian masters. Fascination involves inducing a trance-like state through the use of the gaze and hand gestures, while magnetic fascination works on an energetic level. Combining these techniques can lead to powerful therapeutic results or personal influence.",

Max Tira) the worlds leading expert in hypnotic and mmgnetic fascination. Hypnotic fascination is a technique dating back to the Greeks and the Egyptians, where with the use of the gaze you can induce instant trance, and get deeply in contact with the reality of another person. Dr. Paret and dr. Max Tira learned the techniques from two ancient italian masters. Dr. Paret has also written a book in italian about it. With fascination we act on the subjective reality of a person through the use of the gaze and some hand gestures. For therapeutical results we use symbols. Note that even modern hypnosis was originated from a popularized technique of the school of fascination. Braid, a physician of Manchester, observed in fact that bright objects could induce trance and coined for this state the name \"hypnosis\". Obviously, Fascination involves many more techniques, and it is lightning fastin its results. With fascination we have a kind of therapy where the subject is leaded in a natural state of well being. We can naturally use it also for personal influence. If we put together fascination and magnetism we have \"magnetic fascination\". Magnetic fascination involves also concepts relating to what in Eastern countries is called \"prana\" or \"ki\" and works on energetic level.",
