  "title": "\"How can embracing chaos and letting go of inner child help overcome anxiety and OCD?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the book, the inner child was identified as a manifestation of chaos and dysfunction within the nervous system. However, as the author explains, it is important to let go of this inner child and move towards working with chaos in a positive way. In this final section, the author introduces their forthcoming book, \"The Tao of Chaos: Essence and the Enneagram, Quantum Consciousness, Volume II,\" which will explore the idea of chaos as the infinity of space and formless matter. The author shares two examples of individuals who had a deep-seated fear of void or nothingness, which ultimately led to anxiety. Through therapy, the author helped these individuals embrace the void as a friend, leading to a disappearance of their anxiety.",
  "content": "20) Certainly we have seen that the inner child is a manifestation of that disorder or, in psychological terms, dysfunction. The second definition of chaos by Webster, \"the infinity of space or formless matter supposed to have preceded the existence of the ordered universe,\" (American College Dictionary, pg. 201) will take the front seat in The Tao of Chaos. Why do we all resist nothingness or what the Buddhist calls \"void\"? Let me explain by calling to mind two people who came to see me for psychotherapy. The first person, a businessman, suffered from acute anxiety. We first took apart the trances and the basic structures of his inner child. What was left was a much deeper, much more terrifying and much more resisted experience... the feeling of void, no-thing-ness. We found that this man had resisted this ever-present void within himself to so intense a degree because he felt he would be swal- lowed up by it and disappear. Since chaos also is defined as the \"infinity of space,\" our work began to move in the direction of seeing the void as a friend, always there, untouched and quiet. His anxiety disappeared. Why?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing the \"void\" or chaos within ourselves can be a powerful path to healing and growth. By confronting our inner turmoil and allowing ourselves to experience the nothingness, we can find peace and liberation from our fears and anxieties. So, let us not fear the chaos but embrace it with open hearts and minds."
