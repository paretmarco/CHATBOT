  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the negative side of hypermnesia and suggests two steps to handle amnesia related to the inner child identity. Hypermnesia is a condition where a person can remember everything, even from years before. However, this condition can result in a watchful and mistrusting attitude. To handle amnesia, the author suggests locating the inner child identity in the body and asking questions like \"What can you remember?\" until nothing else pops up. The examples given pertain to different subjects like the past, current events, and personal relationships.",
  "content": "Ask the inner child questions like, \"What can you (the inner child) remember about X\" (a particular situa- tion). For example, if you have an idea that your father drank, ask the inner child, \"What can you (inner child) not remember about father's drinking?\" or \"What do you (the inner child) not know about your childhood?\" Write down your answers and keep asking the question, until nothing pops-up. Examples for remembering the past: \"What do you (the inner child) not know about X?\" Write down your answers until nothing more pops up. Fill in X with the words below, and keep asking the questions, writing them down, until nothing pops-up. My mother My father My brother/sister My childhood My relationship Examples for remembering current events: My business My car My bills My life Other examples: 1. What are you (the inner child), unwilling to know about the past? 116 446 The Dark Side of the Inner Child 2. What are you (the inner child), willing to know about the past? 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by asking your inner child specific questions about your past and present, you can uncover memories and beliefs that may have been previously hidden. Understanding the reasons behind amnesia and hypermnesia can help you break through denial and expand your knowledge, leading to a greater understanding of yourself and your life experiences."
