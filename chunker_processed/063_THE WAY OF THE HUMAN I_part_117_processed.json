  "title": "\"How can we maintain multi-dimensional awareness and discover who we truly are?\" - Exploring the Eight Dimensions of Human Consciousness with Quantum Psychology",
  "first_phrase": "The final section of the text explores the question of how to maintain awareness of all eight dimensions of human existence simultaneously. Prior to this, the author had discussed the various levels and dimensions of awareness and manifestation, highlighting the need to discover who we are by developing multi-dimensional awareness. However, this discovery is impeded when awareness becomes habitually fixated and shrunken, making it necessary to collapse the levels. This is illustrated by the example of a woman going through a divorce in Germany, who lacked external awareness despite being unconditionally loving. In the remaining 200 tokens, the author provides strategies to deepen and cultivate multi-dimensional awareness.",
  "content": "How to deepen and cultivate awareness of these different dimensions so that we can become aware of all eight dimensions of our humanness. COLLAPSING THE LEVELS In the early chapters of The Way of the Human \"I\" discussed eight levels or dimensions of manifestation and awareness. The purpose of Quantum Psychology is to find out WHO YOU ARE. The possible first step is to liberate your awareness by first developing the,ability to maintain multi-dimensional awareness and then to ultimately go beyond awareness itself. The liberation of awareness could be an aid in the discovery of \"WHO YOU ARE.\" Unfortunately, this discovery is greatly inhibited because awareness gets habitually fixated and shrunken. Awareness can be fixated at the external dimension, thinking dimension, emotional dimension, and at the biological dimension. Awareness can even become fixated at the level of ESSENCE. Although being fixated on ESSENCE might at first seem wonderful, it can lead to problems on different dimensions. For example, being unconditionally loving, an essential aspect, is great, but if you lack awareness of the external world, then people could rip you off. I recently met a woman in Germany who was going through a divorce.",
  "last_phrase": "To deepen and cultivate awareness of all eight dimensions of our humanness, we must liberate our awareness from fixations and develop the ability to maintain multi-dimensional awareness. Remember the Quantum Psychology Principle: Meet the problem at the level of the problem, and understand that what is true at one level of awareness may not be true at another. With these tools, we can discover \"WHO YOU ARE\" and navigate life with greater understanding and empowerment."
