  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus shifts to handling pain through various techniques such as creating gaps between sensations and using the classical approach of anesthetizing the painful area by visualizing it as transparent and tracing the route of the nerves to the brain. These techniques require present-time choice and conscious intention. The earlier part of the article discussed Sexual Tantra, where the focus is on spreading sensations throughout the entire body during sexual contact to enhance energy and promote deeper self-connection.",
  "content": "This is a good sign of effectiveness. Then suggest a longer and longer space or gap between the painful sensations.

Classical approach - acute pain: In the classical approach, the area to anesthetize can be marked off by imagining a mental circle around the painful area. Suggest that if the pain is in an ankle, for example, to see the leg as transparent, and see particularly the wiring of the nerves that carry the painful sensations of the leg. Eventually, the route of the nerves (\"wiring\") can be traced into the back of the brain. Suggestions offered for visualizing can be of a computer room or a telephone switchboard, where the wires con- nect from the ankle into the switchboard or into the computer room in the brain. Then (with permission of the unconscious), disconnect the painful sensations. Appendix II â€¢ 171 Conclusion As with all self-trancing, this chapter deals with present-time choice. In the former chapters, the inner child makes present and future automatically look like the past to the adult.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, utilizing the classical approach of acute pain along with appropriate suggestions is a good sign of effectiveness. By imagining a mental circle around the painful area and tracing the route of the nerves into the back of the brain, one can disconnect the painful sensations. It is important to remember that self-trancing provides choice in the present moment, unlike inner child trances that make present and future look like the past automatically."
