  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the concept of Archetypes in spiritual paths is explored. The Physics Dimensions are discussed as vehicles for strings that demonstrate our consciousness. The understanding of Archetypes is that we cannot go beyond them by acting on them. The \"personal I\" does not choose, but rather by-products created by the Physics Dimensions and the Archetypes give us the illusion of choice. The text also introduces a person who believed in Archetypal images and worked with them to derive meanings.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You can never go beyond an Archetype by using, acting out, believing in an Archetype or through the Archetype itself. Do you know why we end up getting nowhere (going beyond \"ourselves\") on a spiritual path we imagine we choose? Because we are \"acting out an Archetype?\" The Archetype condensed (Rainbow) can only choose, react, re-enforce its own Archetypical patterns, beliefs and, in a word, it can only re-enforce itself. 'Actually- these Archetypal \"choices\" are due to a combination of interactions in the Physics Dimensions. The \"personal I\" never chooses. The idea of choice and chooser comes after the experience has already taken place and is a by-product created by the Physics Dimensions, and the Archetypes. It is the root of ego, \"1 do,\" I choose,\" etc. Later exists in time but in the VOID. of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS there is no-time hence it becomes meaningless (see Chapter V). 90 ________________ I He believed in Archetypal images which he saw as real. 2. He worked with them, derived meanings from them, analyzed them and, in short, acted on them. 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to truly move beyond ourselves on a spiritual path, we need to understand that we cannot go beyond an archetype by acting it out or believing in it. The idea of choice and the chooser are by-products of the physics dimensions and archetypes, creating the root of the ego. We must recognize that we are part of the archetypes and beyond them or their interpreters. Only then can we truly transcend and become our highest selves."
