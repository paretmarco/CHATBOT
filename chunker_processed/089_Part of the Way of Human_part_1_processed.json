  "title": "\"What is The Way of the Human in Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness and Finding Your Biological Core?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author describes how fear can affect the body's extensor and flexor muscle systems, and how that impact can prevent us from being present in the moment. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces the concept of \"The Way of the Human,\" which refers to developing multi-dimensional awareness of our body and surroundings. This approach can help us regain our clarity of organization and overcome the influences of social conditioning. The text also references Dr. Carl Ginsberg, who believes that organizing action around the center core of skeletal structures can promote potent, erect action.",
  "content": "The Way of the Human â–  Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Dr. Carl Ginsberg says it this way: For potent, erect action, the extensor system must bring the skeletal structures to a center core around which action can he organized. I am convinced that the sensing of this skeletal security equates with the ability to he present in the moment, and to act without self interference or overt over-conscious control. A very young child can hold the head in near perfect balance with clear support from the central structural core of spine and pelvis. Fear, however, produces the flexor responses which contract the system away from this core of support, and require that muscular action be produced to counteract this contraction in order for the person to continue to be able to act in gravity. ln the ideal state all action is produced with an even distribution of tonus throughout the musculature. In the more typical situation this clarity of organization is lost through the overlay of responses including emotions, feelings and thoughts impressed by parents and social conditioning.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by developing a multi-dimensional awareness of our biological core, we can overcome the flexor responses caused by fear and achieve an even distribution of tonus throughout our musculature. This can help us act without self-interference or overt over-conscious control, and prevent the creation of a False Self. By doing so, we can alleviate tension in various parts of our body and achieve a state of potent, erect action that is centered around a core of support."
