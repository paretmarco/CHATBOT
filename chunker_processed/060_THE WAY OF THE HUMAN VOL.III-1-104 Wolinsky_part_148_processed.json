  "title": "\"What is the NOT-I-I Exercise and the Observer-Witness Distinction in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text titled \"NOT-I-I Exercise #1: The Quantum Psychology Breakthrough\", the concept of the \"NOT-I-I\" is introduced as the last way-station for awareness that breaks down the imagined separation of the observer from the observed, which creates the illusion of time. The observer-observed dyad arises and subsides simultaneously, and in the NOT-I-I and VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, there is no before or prior. The text also distinguishes between the observer and the witness, where the former is part of the observed, while the latter is pure awareness beyond the observer-observed dyad.",
  "content": "The observer-observed arose and will subside together, and neither arose and subsided together. The idea of before is an idea of the observer only. In the NOT-I-I and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS there is no before or prior, everything arises and will subside as one piece in NOTIME-TIME. 145 The Way of the Human ■ Beyond Quantum Psychology THE OBSERVER AND THE WITNESS The observer is part of the observed, The WITNESS is pure awareness beyond the observer-observed dyad. Many systems confuse observation and WITNESSING. For example, if I watch a thought—but think I am the \" which is watching—then I am observing. If I move \"my\" arm, and believe it is \"I\" which moves the arm—then I am observing. If I watch with judgment, evaluation or significance, then it is observing. The WITNESS, on the other hand, is aware, but is not identified with an experiencer or an exerpience nor is it identified with an \"I\" which is observing it. The WITNESS is beyond even mindfulness, such as \"I \" am mindful of a psychological pattern. The WITNESS is pure awareness. The WITNESS is amazed at what occurs.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, distinguishing between observation and witnessing can help us move beyond our identification with an experience or an \"I\" that observes. By recognizing the pure awareness of the witness, we can rest in the space between the \"I AM\" and the \"VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS,\" where even awareness itself disappears. As we realize that the observer-observed arises and subsides together, we come to see that the idea of before is an illusion of the observer's mind."
