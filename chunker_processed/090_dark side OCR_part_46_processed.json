  "title": "How does age regression and the inner child impact our present relationships and emotional parameters?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the concept of the inner child and how age regression can keep us stuck in past traumas. Now, let's explore a real-life example of how the inner child can limit our emotional parameters and decisions. We take a look at a mother who asks her child to please her to earn love, approval, and attention. This can lead to the creation of a pleasing-child identity and cause long-lasting trauma. The dark side of the inner child can project past incidents onto present situations, creating interpersonal limitations. Let's dive deeper into this topic.",
  "content": "This experience of being \"stuck\" in a past place or point in one' s personal history is the inner child' s stuckness, not the present-time adult. This is why, as an adult, you say, feel, or react in certain ways out of your control and don't understand why. You relate to the world through the inner child identity, which creates the parameters for future interpersonal limitation. In other words, seeing our present-time relationship through the past-time window of the inner child limits our view, resources, emotional parameters, and our decisions. Let' s take an example of a mother who wants her child to \"please her.\" Asking a child to please Mom in order to get love, attention, and approval can be more traumatic for the child than Age Regression + 27 might normally be appreciated. Asking a child to give up what they want, or even to \"give-up themselves\" to please Mom, and hence survive, is asking a child to give up an internal need. In the confusion and chaos of determining how to survive, the observer creates a pleasing-child identity.",
  "last_phrase": "Breaking free from the limitations of our inner child can be a difficult process, but it is essential for our growth and well-being. By recognizing and understanding the ways in which our past experiences shape our present-day reactions and behaviors, we open ourselves up to new perspectives and possibilities, creating a fuller, more fulfilling life for ourselves and those around us."
