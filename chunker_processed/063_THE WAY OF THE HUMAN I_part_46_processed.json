  "title": "What are the dimensions of human awareness and consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author explores the Eighth Dimension, which is Pure Awareness or the NOT-I-I. This dimension is formless and aware of the void of undifferentiated consciousness that surrounds us. It serves as the pure witnessing beyond the observer-observed dyad and rests between I AM and the VOID. This text is part of \"The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness,\" which covers several dimensions of human experience, including the emotional, biological, essence, and collective unconscious dimensions.",
  "content": "The non-verbal I AM is the No-state-state; it is non-verbal pure being. It is the root, or as Nisargadatta Maharaj said, the seed of individual consciousness. Without it there can be no individual psychology, i.e., it occurs or is naturally realized when you do not use your thoughts, memories, emotions, perceptions or associations, and is pure being. However, there is no awareness of the VOID. The I AM is the deepest archetype of the Collective. The Seventh Dimension is the COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS or THE ARCHETYPICAL DIMENSION (Volume III). It contains the basic substance which connects us all. It also contains the archetypes which are made and produced by the physics dimensions and forces, i.e., energy, space, mass, time, gravity, light, electromagnetics, strong and weak nuclear forces, etc. 20 Chapter The Eighth Dimension is THE NOT-I-I (see Volume III). It is Pure Awareness. It is formless. It is aware of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS which surrounds us and yet is a part of it. It is pure WITNESSING, beyond the observer-observed dyad. The WITNESS, or Pure Awareness, rests between I AM and the VOID.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of I AM as the no-state-state and pure being is crucial to grasping the root of individual consciousness. The Collective Unconscious and Not-I-I dimensions also play significant roles in connecting and transcending individual consciousness. Ultimately, the realization of the VOID or UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is beyond awareness and is the purest form of being in existence."
