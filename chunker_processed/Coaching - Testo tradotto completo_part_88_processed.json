  "title": "What exercises can help bring energy balance and reduce stress and anxiety?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author suggests an exercise to help balance emotional energy. Before the last 200 tokens, the author explains that by doing small hand movements (\"steps\") directed downwards, while focusing on the sensation between palm and body, emotional balance can be achieved. Additionally, circular steps over the belly can help reduce stress and anxiety. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the \"second brain\" located in the intestine and its connection to emotions, serotonin release, and wellbeing. The exercise concludes with suggestions for more comprehensive steps to promote relaxation.",
  "content": "It is further incumbent on us to know that, though the intestine only hosts one tenth of the brain’s neurons, it nevertheless operates in an autonomous fashion, helps the entrenchment of the memories that are linked to emotions, and fulfils an essential role in signalling joy and pain. The intestine, in short, is the seat of a second brain. In the belly, we also come across some autonomous neuronal tissue. It is no coincidence that the intestine cells produce 95% of serotonin, which is the neurotransmitter of wellbeing 24. The intestine releases serotonin as a result of external stimuli, such as food being caused to enter it, but also as a result of sounds or colours, or as a by-product of precisely the “step-based” methodology. Finally, for the sake of relaxation, you might also embark on more comprehensive “steps”. Such “steps” are carried out by bringing your hands to the level of the forehead, by opening them and by slowly letting them slide down the body, their palms facing the body, while you give attention to the sensations which correspond to the different areas.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking care of our intestine and relaxing our body and mind through simple steps can lead to a more peaceful and serene state. Remembering to be present and focused on one task or thought at a time can also help alleviate unnecessary tensions in our daily lives."
