  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the importance of being present and self-aware while carrying out daily activities. This final section emphasizes the importance of understanding our own unique direction in life in order to attain our goals. The author suggests that by being conscious and aware of our surroundings, we can discover our true purpose and achieve a better understanding of ourselves and the universe. It is important to note that this purpose is unique for every individual and cannot be found through external conditioning. The text concludes with the idea that by understanding our own direction, we can achieve a greater sense of fulfillment and purpose in life.",
  "content": "Every human being is unique, and what is fine for an individual is not necessarily suitable to a different person. We must be able to keep to the ground, and simultaneously find our own dimension. The key to that is to be present, that is, to enlarge our consciousness as much as we can, until we are eventually able to be in communion with harmony. So long as we are present, our feeling will not be deceitful. When we are present, we are able to discover our true dimension, either through the help of a profound intuition, or by deducing it from the things which surround us, thanks to a look which is grounded on presence. There are in fact some accumulations of reality which, once perceived, might help us comprehend the direction that should be taken and further developed. We must realize the direction that is ensconced in things. Understanding oneâ€™s own direction is tantamount to get a better understanding of the Universe and of ourselves within that Universe. Every man, each one according to his idiosyncratic nature and his specific culture, unconsciously formulates in his mind a purpose which he makes his own.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly discover our own purpose and direction in life, we must first learn to be present and attentive to the world around us. By avoiding the influence of external ideals, and consciously deciding our own path, we can each find our unique place in the universe and enjoy a fulfilling life. Remember, staying grounded in the present moment is the key to unlocking our true potential."
