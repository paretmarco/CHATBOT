  "title": "What are some exercises for developing sensory awareness and presence in order to live more serenely?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about exercises that help us develop presence and improve our awareness of our bodies, such as focusing on a body part and being conscious of our breathing while eating. In this last part, we delve deeper into the connection between our physical and emotional responses. The author stresses the importance of distinguishing between physiological reactions and mental responses and how awareness of the former can help us live more serenely. The exercises centered on sensory perception can assist in freeing us from psychosomatic reactions and excessive mental dialogues. This part also highlights the negative impact that physiological reactions can have on other people, making it crucial to regain presence when they occur.",
  "content": "Now you must further extend your consciousness to your speech. Listen to yourselves talking. Be aware of the fact you are talking. This particular exercise has a visible effect even on the people around you. If you speak while you LISTEN TO YOURSELVES SPEAKING, your voice will come out clearer and neater. These exercises which are centred on direct sensory perception will gift you greater awareness of your body, and will gradually free you from a whole array of psychosomatic reactions. Although the body is the foundation of physical actions, many people confuse the body’s physiological reactions with its emotional responses. In some instances, indeed, some of these persons go as far as turning other people into the victims of such physiological reactions. For instance, a person suffering from stomach ache becomes irritated with other individuals. We must of necessity distinguish physiological reactions from mental responses, as otherwise the former would turn into hooks which will no longer allow us to live serenely. Having consciousness of the side which is responsible for bodily reactions is further useful as a tool to get rid of one’s excessive mental dialogues.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing bodily awareness and distinguishing physiological reactions from mental responses, we can free ourselves from the limitations of our inner dialogue and live more serenely. By extending our consciousness to our speech and listening to ourselves speak, we can communicate more clearly and create a positive impact on those around us. These exercises may be challenging, but even reducing our useless thoughts by 10% can lead to a better quality of life. Therefore, keep practicing and improving your bodily awareness to live a life of consciousness and clarity."
