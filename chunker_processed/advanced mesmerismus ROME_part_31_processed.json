  "first_phrase": "This text explores various techniques and exercises in self-hypnosis, magnetism, and quantum physics in order to achieve different goals such as weight loss and allergy treatments. The last 200 tokens describe the different levels of moving therapy and introduce the concept of true and derivative symbolism. The text notes that even our hands can express different types of symbolism, and psychologists must take into account the effects of education and experience on the original archetypal symbolism.",
  "content": "There is a relationship between hermeticism, magnetism and quantum physics Schopenauer is in fact the key because he highly influenced the group of scientists that was at the basis of the \"quantum paradygm\" exercise =========================================================== TRUE AND DERIVATIVE SYMBOLISM The symbols as the vertical, the circle, are primitive and archetipal symbols Jung had called them \"archetypes\" But there is a \"derivate somnambulism\" that is based on the original symbol that can take MEANINGS from experiences an example is the symbol of the cross. It is an archetype, but in the christian Religion it takes further meaning Another exemple are the symbol of the MOTHER and the FATHER They are archetypes, but they get psychologically coloured. We have the true symbol, but education can \"CHARGE\" in some way the symbol. Even our hands can express symbolism. Pointing hand - directive and indicative Open hand - receiving and harmonizing Small distant touch - in some way we stay \"detached\" Archetyply, the Pointing hand many types is related to the father/male figure, the receiveing hand to the mother/female figure The psychology of our relationships with these figures will give \"colour\" to the original archetypical symbolism (Benemeglio). It means the person will search or refuse some kind of touches Furter traumatism can lead the person in not wanting any touch. We must always work experimentally. We have three styles of hypnotherapy and touch Directive Mother Detached These three types are also in Virginia Satir that observed the existence of three types.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the symbolic meanings we assign to archetypes can be influenced by our experiences and relationships, and understanding our preferences as hypnotists and adapting our approach accordingly can lead to more effective therapy. Further, exercises such as the mirror exercise, Enneagram memorization, and Indian Self-hypnosis can enhance our sensitivity and ability to access our inner senses. Finally, exploring methods such as clairvoyance and Terpsichore Trance Therapy can provide a deeper understanding of ourselves and the universe around us."
