  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the importance of understanding our internal thinking world and its impact on our external reality was explained. Now, the focus shifts to the external world and how it is often neglected in psychology and New Age spirituality. The idea that \"our thoughts create reality\" has led to a collapsing and confusing of the thinking dimension with the external dimension. The example of a guru who experiences unprocessed psychology when faced with a change in external context is given. This highlights the need for developing multidimensional awareness to be truly free.",
  "content": "Anything that you do not know about, you are the slave of; anything you know about The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness you can be free of. Therefore, we meditate to know and be free of the unknown material in our consciousness. UNCOOKED SEEDS The external world is oftentimes neglected in both psychological and New Age spiritual circles. It is imagined and thought to be dominated by our beliefs, traumas, etc., hence the New Age expression, \"Our thoughts create reality.\" But thoughts are on one dimension and the external world is on another. They are connected but they have different functions. Remember, thoughts help to create our subjective internal reality but not necessarily our external reality. This represents the collapsing and confusing the thinking dimension with the external dimension. Imagine a guru who sits in a protected external world where all his needs are met, food, clothing, etc., He is able to sit somewhere in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., Change the context (the external) and his unprocessed psychology (thoughts, etc.,) comes up for him. For example, when gurus come to America or Europe, they get into money and sex.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, multi-dimensional awareness is crucial for freeing ourselves from the unknown material in our consciousness. It's essential to understand that thoughts help create our subjective internal reality but not necessarily our external reality. Therefore, it's important to address the uncooked seeds or unresolved issues in our lives through awareness and consciousness to avoid getting trapped in them when external contextual changes occur."
