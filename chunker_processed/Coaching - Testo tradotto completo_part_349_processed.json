  "title": "How can speaking to yourself in front of a mirror and visualizing symbols help you shape your persona?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed the importance of using a formula and visualizing oneself while projecting vibrations into water's reflection to achieve the desired qualities. The last 200 tokens explain the next phase of the ritual, absorption, which involves assimilating the desired qualities into one's body. The text also emphasizes the need to envision oneself with utmost intensity and adopt the attitudes one would like to possess. The author suggests projecting a portrait of oneself if imagining one's body in a vacuum is difficult. The concept of equivalence between inner qualities and outer physical appearance is also mentioned.",
  "content": "In the event that the desired quality happens to be of a moral nature, you will depict your own selves as being endowed with the outer appearance which corresponds to such quality, on account of the well-known equivalence which exists between the inner qualities of the spirit and one’s exterior physical guise. If you find it difficult to imagine your own body “in a vacuum”, take care to place, at a close distance, some portrait of yours, and then project it, in a modified form, inside the liquid, using the force of your suggestion for that purpose. You must in fact remember that every instinctive impulse, every motion by your passions, every state pertaining to the sphere of affections, which is ordinarily intense, runs counter to this condition of “envisioning”. You are obligatorily called upon to truly see your own selves, exactly as if you were the Homunculus of the magician Doctor Faust, shaking, bending, smiling, lifting yourselves up, in short, adopting the selfsame attitudes you would like your beings to be characterized by tomorrow. Assimilation in the body The next phase to unfold itself is the phase of absorption.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, envisioning and assimilating your desired qualities is not an easy feat, but through careful execution, it can lead to great results. Remember to depict your physical appearance to match the desired moral quality and use the force of suggestion to project your modified portrait. Drink the enlivened water slowly with the idea of vibrations bouncing back to you and circulating within your being. Success depends on precise implementation of both the material and spiritual components."
