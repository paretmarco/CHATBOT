  "content": "Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also \"proxemics\" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements Use also the principles of the four steps therapy: - Concentration of the mind - Hypnosis - Solutions - Amplifying solutions GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions. IF THEY OPEN UP in speaking about their emotions they will OPEn UP to hypnosis If somebody speaks about their emotions he recognizes you positively In the group dont oblige people Inside these technique is the concept we cannot not communicate HAVE A FEEDBACK WITH THE CLIENT You must try to be neutral because at the begin you dont know if the client want a \"hard\" therapist, a \"sweet\" therapist or a \"detached\" therapist (remember the SATIR figures) We can say YOU DO NOTHING.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these techniques and exercises aim to help therapists enhance their skills and increase their therapeutic effectiveness. From practicing proxemics to utilizing the four-step therapy principles and hypnodrama method, therapists can create a positive atmosphere, attune to their clients' needs, and work towards resolving emotional issues. The use of non-verbal hypnosis, fluidification, magnetism, and moving therapy can also help balance emotions, increase sensitivity, and induce deep somnambulism. By understanding different types of personalities and muscular preferences, therapists can tailor their approach to each client and achieve better results. With dedication and practice, therapists can become more present and effective in their work."
