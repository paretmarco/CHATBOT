  "content": "Body work helps the \"forgotten\" or denied memory stored in the body to emerge. Furthermore, many schools of psychotherapy, i.e. Reichian, Bioenergetic, suggest that a body pattern correlates with a psycho- logical pattern. Working with Yourself Do your breathing and your muscles stay the same? Almost every psychological component seems to have a physical compo- nent. If you are directed to breathe, look and stay aware; the events Amnesia + 113 that precipitated the amnesia often emerge. There's nothing wrong with having amnesia, if you are able to pick and choose when you want it. The following is an edited transcript that demonstrates work with amnesia. Stephen:I want you to remember a time ... do you remember a time when you felt real amne- sic? Patient:Yes, I don't remember getting beat up by a bully in school. Stephen:As you see an image of yourself in that situation, I'd like you to see that bully; describe him, and feel the \"you\" in the image inside your body. (I am asking the client to return the trauma back inside his body.) What happens to your body for you to ac- complish that?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, working with the body through techniques such as breathing and muscle awareness can help access forgotten or denied memories that have a physical and psychological component. By bringing the trauma back into the body, it can be processed and potentially released, leading to a healthier mental state."
