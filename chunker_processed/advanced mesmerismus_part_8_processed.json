It begins by discussing the use of magnetic passes on the spine and the nine magnetic nerve nodes to intercept and bind the magnetic force and heal pain in various parts of the body. The text then introduces the closure of senses and the technique of the ten plexuses to induce a magnetic state more quickly. It goes on to discuss exercises using music, mirrors, and non-verbal communication to deepen the state of ecstasy and induce a deep trance. The text also introduces the Taurus technique for inducing deep hypnosis and non-verbal hypnotherapy for regression therapy. The section ends with an exercise on proxemics and a magnetic circle to show the power of group energy and non-verbal communication.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the techniques and exercises presented in these sessions aim to introduce and develop skills in non-verbal hypnotism, magnetic therapy, and self-hypnosis. The exercises aim to help individuals understand and work with different levels of consciousness and engage in more effective communication with themselves and others. By incorporating elements such as sounds, breathing, and movements, these exercises aim to evoke emotional responses and help individuals achieve their desired outcomes, from weight loss to enhancing presence and communication skills. The techniques presented in these sessions will require practice and repetition to master, but with dedication and effort, individuals can enhance their abilities and achieve more profound hypnotic success."
