  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored how traders often use their subjective beliefs and convictions to communicate their viewpoints on the market. In the last 200 tokens, the focus shifts to the potential success of self-hypnosis for traders, allowing them to notify their mind of their goals without necessarily informing it of the method. By relying on their unconscious mind, traders can move beyond rational thinking and efficiently use their intuition to obtain the best results. When traders fail in their intent, they may resort to pre-packaged trading methods and systems, which are often advertised on the Internet.",
  "content": "The point of the matter is that the more we have the chance of gathering a variety of data and points of view (which would essentially mean we have managed to build a well-developed quantum register, one going even further than the three points we have referred to earlier), the greater will be our predisposition to snatch those intuitions enabling us to attain our goal. This is indeed an essential element behind the potential success of self-hypnosis. Through hypnosis, in fact, we might notify our mind of what we would like to attain, without however informing it of the method through which we shall accomplish that. This latter ability will be provided to us by our unconscious mind. This is this type of intuitions that will allow us to obtain the best results, as it denotes moving beyond our rational thinking and efficiently resorting to the power of our unconscious mind. When a trader fails in his intent, he tends to look up to other people for the solution to his problems, and scouts around for pre-packed trading methods and systems which are deemed infallible, and which are often advertised on the Internet as guaranteeing inflated percentages of return on oneâ€™s investment.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, investing in ourselves is the cornerstone of success, whether it's in trading or in any other aspect of life. By building a well-developed quantum register of varying viewpoints and relying on our intuitive abilities, we can unlock the power of our unconscious mind and overcome obstacles to achieve our goals. Remember, the solution lies within us, and we must take the time to find our personalized approach and make ourselves the best investment we can. Every day, we wake up with our own purpose and goal - ultimately, that's what truly matters."
