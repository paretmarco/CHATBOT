  "title": "What is the False Core-False Self and how does it affect access to one's deepest self?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the concept of False Core-False Self and its attempt to capture \"Essence\" externally, causing failure and collapsing dimensions. The False Self tries to heal the False Core instead of dismantling it, preventing ESSENCE from revealing and stabilizing. The text suggests a six-step de-fusion process to handle the fusion of Essence with False Core. The conversation between Jill and Wolinksy demonstrates the fusion of emptiness with the False Core driver of \"I am alone\" and the pain it creates.",
  "content": "But ESSENCE, along with these essentiabqualities, is oftentimes \"outside\" of the awareness of the other dimensions. Hopelessly, the False Self tries to heal the False Core. It is only when the False Core-False Self is dismantled that ESSENCE is revealed and stabilized. To demonstrate the power of the False Core and its fusion with the ESSENCE a demonstration is provided below. ESSENCE AND THE FALSE CORE ESSENCE and the False Core are often fused together. To handle this, use the six-step de-fusion process. Jill:I feel this dark, emptiness inside and I feel alone. ________________ Chapter I Therapeutic Note Notice how she immediately fuses and labels the emptiness with the False Core Driver of \"I am alone.\" Wolinsky:If the dark empty space is fused with alone, what gets created? Jill:Terrible pain. Wolinksy:What was assumed, decided or believed that got you to creating that? Jill:emptiness is painful. Wolinsky:If this dark, empty space is fused with and equals \"I am alone,\" what does not occur? Jill:Not creating the opportunity to experience what is. I'm not creating that there is nothing to create. Wolinsky:Okay.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to reveal and stabilize ESSENCE, it is necessary to de-fuse it from the False Core. This fusion of ESSENCE and False Core is often outside our awareness, but by following the six-step process, we can dismantle it, as demonstrated by Jill's experience of a quiet, vast, and peaceful space when liberated from false beliefs."
