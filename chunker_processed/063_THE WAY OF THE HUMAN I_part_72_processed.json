  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the False Core tendencies and its influence over people's behavior and psychology were analyzed. Now, in the last 200 tokens, Quantum Psychology is introduced as a means of understanding and navigating the False Core-False Self. Rather than attempting to change it, individuals are urged to sit with it, be with it, and observe it without resistance. By doing so, they can reach a state of freedom beyond the False Core and access the non-verbal I AM level of consciousness.",
  "content": "In Quantum Psychology, you learn to 34 ________________ Chapter II become clear about what the False Core is—that one underlying structure—and then to trace all of your behavior back to it. This is an internal process, and you are constantly tracking your behavior, your actions, your feelings, everything, back to your False Core. Once you get there, you have to sit in it. There's no way around it. You do not try to change it. Anytime you try to change it or get rid of it, you are resisting it, which is one of the five strategies or five Re 's of the False Core-False Self—resisting, re-enacting, re-creating, reinforcing and re-solving. Sitting in y srurrFalse Core means you are free and are able to BE it or UN-BE but not to believe it, to merge with it and observe it simultaneously, and just be with it without trying to get rid of it. Then to go beyondit, \"you\" stay in the non-verbal I AM level \"prior\" to it (Volume III). The movement of the mind is all about the interplay of the False Core-False Self.",
  "last_phrase": "In Quantum Psychology, understanding and sitting with your False Core can be a significant step towards freedom from its grip. By observing and being with it, we can step out of the constant cycle of resistance and move towards a deeper sense of the self. Remembering that the False Core is not who we are allows us to connect with the underlying unity of the VOID and fully experience who we truly are."
