  "title": "Where can you find the bibliography for \"Quantum\" on quantum theory of the mind and its applications in various fields like neuroscience, linguistics, and sociology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text provides an extensive list of studies and books on the topic of quantum theory of the mind. It includes the names of the authors, titles of their works, and the universities they belong to. In the last 200 tokens, the paper mentions a study on quantum and classical neural networks for modeling two modes of consciousness. This study was conducted by Rakovic and Dugic and was presented in the Proc. Additionally, the paper gives a bibliography on quantum theory and consciousness for further exploration.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the integration of quantum theory in various fields, including communication, sociology, neuroscience, and linguistics, offers a new perspective and possibilities for research. From understanding the behavior of the human mind to developing artificial intelligence, the implications of quantum mechanics are wide-ranging and transformative. Further exploration and experimentation in this area may lead to groundbreaking discoveries that could change the way we perceive reality and ourselves."
