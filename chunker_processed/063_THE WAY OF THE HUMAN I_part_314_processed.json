  "title": "\"What are Some Ideas and Sensations Associated with Being Alive and Less Solid?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter VIII of this text, the author and Wolinsky are discussing the idea of feeling \"diffuse\" or less solid. The author sees it as an interesting but scary sensation that makes them feel like they might disappear. They explore different ideas about this concept, including the notion that being diffuse is bad and goes against the expectations of society. However, they also suggest that it could be a defense mechanism. The last question posed by the author is about an entirely unrelated idea: shitting.",
  "content": "Sensations are like they hold the range of feeling for me. Sometimes they feel good, sometimes they don't. Chapter VIII Just here. There is this feeling that I just amâ€”feeling sort of diffuse. When you say diffuse, you mean? Spacious, less solid. Tell me an idea you have about this experience called less solid or diffuse. That if I kept going, I would disappear. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea you have about this diffuse. That it means I'm not really here. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea you have about the idea called diffuse. That diffuse is bad. That when someone is diffuse, they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing. Any other ideas about the idea or concept called diffuse? That you are not supposed to be diffuse because you are merging or meshing, all those kind of bad terms. Tell me another idea about the idea called diffuse. That diffuse is a defense. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea you have about the idea called diffuse. Wolinsky: Mark: Wolinsky: Mark: Tell me idea you have about shitting.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our feelings and sensations are complex and varied, sometimes feeling good and sometimes not. The experience of being diffuse or less solid can bring up a range of ideas and emotions, and it's important to explore these without judgment. Remember, even bodily functions like shitting can have a variety of meanings and associations, so it's essential not to oversimplify our experiences. Stay curious and open-minded as you continue to explore your emotions and sensations."
