  "title": "\"How Can Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology Help You Reclaim Your Inner Child?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section focuses on the concept of the Inner Child and explains how childhood experiences of trauma can result in problematic states. The author, John Lennon, describes how trances are created and utilized as survival strategies during childhood which become pathological in the adult years. Unlike the popularized version of the \"precious inner child\", the author focuses on the wounded inner child stuck in a particular time frame. Mentioned are the works of different psychotherapies that contribute to the understanding of inner child concept. Prior to this section, the author describes his book Trances People Live and its significance in understanding the trance phenomenon.",
  "content": "Yet what was a survival strategy for an overwhelmed child attempting to cope with chaos becomes the core of symptom structure for the coping adult. Not to be confused with the so-called precious inner child now so popular in therapeutic circles, this is a wounded inner child stuck at a particular point in time. The words inner child have drawn much fire from different schools of psychotherapy. Actually, to clarify, the inner child concept is not new. In the Psychosynthesis of Roberto Assagioli, he talks of subpersonalities. In the Gestalt Therapy of Fritz Perls, he developed the experience of having different parts dialoguing with one another, the work of Eric Berne, M.D., called Transactional Analysis, developed not only the inner child, but the inner adult, and the inner parent. In discussing the cognitive therapy of Dr. Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, M.D. talks of a similar concept called Schemas. A second major concept in the cognitive model consists of the concept of Schemas. The concept is used to explain why a depressed patient maintains his pain-inducing and self- defeating attitudes despite objective evidence of positive factors in his life. Any situation is composed of a plethora of stimuli.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the inner child concept has been present in various schools of psychotherapy for decades, and it helps us understand the lasting impact of childhood trauma on our coping mechanisms as adults. The concept of Schemas is also a useful tool to explain how our cognitive patterns influence our interpretation of situations. By understanding and addressing these concepts, we can work towards healing and healthier thought patterns."
