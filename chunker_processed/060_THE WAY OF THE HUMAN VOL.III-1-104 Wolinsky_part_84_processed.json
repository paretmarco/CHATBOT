  "title": "\"Who are you beyond your thoughts and emotions? Exploring the No-State state in Quantum Psychology.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about going beyond quantum psychology by acknowledging each prior level of consciousness and seeing them as a construction of pure undifferentiated consciousness or void. The author challenges the reader to explore their non-verbal state and push their awareness further and further back, beyond the I AM, until they reach the big emptiness. Through this process, they will begin to appreciate that nothing exists except on a verbal level. The principle of quantum psychology presented is that you can only see your own level. The text concludes with an invitation to de-construct these prior levels and move towards a higher state of consciousness.",
  "content": "Now, notice the BIG EMPTINESS and how it appears to go on forever. Just keep allowing awareness itself to continue to go further and further backwards. Allow \"the one\" that is moving further and further backward to be the same substance as the BIG EMPTINESS. When you are ready, you can let your eyes open. From \"here\" we begin to appreciate that NOTHING exists except on a verbal (thinking) level. The body and the nervous system produce thoughts of I AM (fill in the blank with \"I\" thoughts). The body is a condensation of the Quantum EMPTINESS and is, therefore, a Quantum event. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You can only see your own level. In other words, things can only be perceived at the level that you are on. Volume III is about GOING BEYOND, about acknowledging each prior level and seeing them as a construction (condensation) of PURE UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or VOID and then allowing it to de-construct. See you soon.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, as we continue our inward journey, we begin to understand that the world we perceive is a construction of our own consciousness. Quantum Psychology teaches us to see beyond the individual level and acknowledge the collective unconscious, recognizing that it is formed by the same Quantum EMPTINESS that creates the physical world. By deconstructing and going beyond each level, we can awaken to the true essence of PURE UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Keep exploring with love, your brother Stephen."
