  "title": "What are the developmental illusions that can lead to solid trances, and how can they affect our lives?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text of this series, the author has elaborated on how a child's experience in a dysfunctional family can affect their trance state and childhood illusions. The last 200 tokens highlight the role of developmental illusions and how they can affect an adult's behavior. The author gives a personal example of how he had illusions of being a basketball player or coach, which he moved on from after realizing the truth. Similarly, the text discusses a client who had illusions of being Christ and how the author helped her realize that those illusions originated from within. The text emphasizes that trances are a continuum from solid to liquid, and it is vital to integrate interpersonal feedback to avoid solidifying developmental illusions.",
  "content": "I then illusioned being a coach. Soon I saw that I didn't have those skills and moved on to find where my skills were. This is a developmental process. If I had become obsessed with playing with Larry Bird and couldn't even give it up when I wasn't drafted, I might have experienced depression. In the woman-who-was-Christ example, I asked the client to imagine that the guides who came to see her and the voices she heard were actually coming from the child inside her. I asked, \"How would you feel if this is true?\" She said, \"Whew, relieved.\" She comfortably saw the illusions were coming from inside of her. She felt relieved. No anxiety. The important idea to note is that trances are a continuum from solid to liquid. We all use trances. Her trance wasn't bad, just more solid than mine. In my case I let go of the desire to be a basketball hero, integrating interpersonal feedback. In contrast, her developmental illusions solidified because she cut off interpersonal feedback. I saw a film in the early 70s directed by Roman Polansky called Repulsion, which demonstrates illusioning.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the continuum of trances that we all use and to be aware that developmental illusions can solidify if we cut off interpersonal feedback. Letting go of unrealistic desires and integrating feedback can help us develop the skills we need to achieve our goals and avoid the negative implications of obsession and depression."
