  "first_phrase": "This section discusses the importance of embracing the experience of not-knowing in therapy and how it coincides with Eastern concepts of meditation. The author also emphasizes the need to be able to spot deep trance phenomena in ourselves before we can recognize them in clients. Through a meditation-like practice, the author labels their thoughts and feelings in terms of trance states. This approach helps in identifying deep trance phenomena, where physical and environmental changes occur during therapy. This allows the therapist to focus on the client's progress and ensures the highest level of care.",

  "last_phrase": "Learning to spot your own deep trance phenomena is an essential skill for any hypnotherapist. By practicing focused attention in a meditation-like environment and observing your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations, you can begin to label and identify your own trance states. This will help you spot your client's deep trances and assist them in their therapy. Remember, slow and methodical practice is key to progress, and everyone's preferred trance state may differ based on their personal history and experiences."
