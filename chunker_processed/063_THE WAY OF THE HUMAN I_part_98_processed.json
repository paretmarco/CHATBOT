  "title": "\"What are the limits of psycho-spiritual practices and the dangers of diagnosis in achieving Quantum Consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, Nisargadatta Maharaj advises a woman to stay for a shorter period to avoid becoming dependent on him for her spiritual growth. The author explains that this approach is student-centered, focusing on the individual's needs, and not teacher-centered. In the last 200 tokens, the author warns about the dangers of diagnosis and typing in psycho-spiritual practice. Contrary to popular belief, the False Core-False Self, Enneagram, and DSM-IV are merely maps constructed by the nervous system and not the person they refer to, which can hinder the development of Quantum Consciousness. Furthermore, identifying with one's False Core-False Self is the most common trap limiting people's spiritual growth.",
  "content": "THE DANGER OF DIAGNOSIS: TAKING PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE NOT There is a major problem in the world of psycho-spiritual practice. People think they can diagnose each other. Then, they think they know the person who has been diagnosed. As Korzybski said, \"The map is not the territory\" and \"the idea is not the thing you are referring to.\" In this way, diagnosis and typing are not the person you are referring to. You must understand that the False Core-False Self, the Enneagram and the D.S.M. IV of Psychology are merely maps; they are constructions of the nervous system. But the nervous system does not see the underlying unity. It cannot because it is a condensation of the underlying unity. If you believe this Nervous System's construction (maps), you will never know Quantum Consciousness. Your concepts, especially your False Core Driver and False Self Compensator, have to de-constructed or disidentified from. PSYCHOLOGY'S FAILURE The most common trap for people is that they believe they are their False Core-False Self and that there are good parts and bad parts of it.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the danger of diagnosis lies in the mistaken belief that it defines a person, when in fact, it only represents a map of the nervous system. To move beyond these constructions and towards quantum consciousness, one must deconstruct false concepts and disidentify from them. Quantum Psychology may have some limitations, but by adopting a more nuanced approach, individuals can better understand themselves and others."
