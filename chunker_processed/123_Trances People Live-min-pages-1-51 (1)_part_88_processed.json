  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author shared their personal experience of realizing how the labels we give our emotions can shape our responses. They discovered that the same sensations they interpreted as \"rejection\" or \"hurt\" could also be interpreted as pleasant experiences when viewed from a different perspective. In this last part, the author introduces the concept of witnessing, exploring how it can create a larger context for our problems and allow us to step back and observe our states of consciousness without being ruled by them. They draw from Eastern and Western perspectives to show how therapeutic trance and dissociation can be used to establish a witnessing consciousness.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of witnessing, originating from ancient Eastern philosophy, has found a place in Western therapeutic practices such as hypnosis. By dissociating the conscious mind from the unconscious, one can adopt a witnessing consciousness that allows them to observe their experiences from a detached perspective. This can be a useful tool in navigating the complexities of life, and can help individuals to disentangle themselves from worldly perils."
