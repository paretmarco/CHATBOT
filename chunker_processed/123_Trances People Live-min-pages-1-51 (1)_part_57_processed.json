  "title": "What is the difference between the \"no-trance state\" and trance states of identification?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding section, the author discusses how trance states of identification can hinder one's ability to process information and function effectively, leading to feelings of confusion and disorientation. In the final 200 tokens, the author introduces a client who describes a sense of non-identification, which they refer to as \"seeing in the middle of nowhere.\" This state is characterized by a sense of flow and freedom, without judgment or attachment. When the client is able to maintain this state in their work environment, they report feeling at their best and coping effectively with large volumes of demands and distractions. However, when they slip into the trance state, they become overwhelmed and must take a break to consciously re-enter the expanded state.",
  "content": "Nothing sticks, nothings gets interrupted in its flow. It's a very rich, very free space to be in. I feel at my best in that state—especially when I can carry it into situations. At my job, large volumes of things pas i work me —people's requests and demands, personnel dynamics, political considerations, and so forth. I have trouble when it feels like all these elements come and Chit something solid---that would be your trance state. When the outer flow hits something solid in me, I begin to lose my good feeling and feel myself shrink down and contract (trance). Then I get confused, disoriented and even a little bit dissociated. I can't keep track of things, I can't process the flow anymore. Everything sticks, stops, and halts. I literally have to stop and go outside, or go into a vacant room and just \"space out\" for a few minutes. I let myself veer hack into that expanded space and then I feel better. I feel like I can cope again.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the trance states that interrupt our flow and cause us to feel overwhelmed and disoriented. By acknowledging these states and taking a few minutes to return to an expanded space, we can cope more effectively and maintain a sense of well-being even in challenging situations. Consider incorporating meditative practices into your daily routine to cultivate a greater sense of focus and balance."
