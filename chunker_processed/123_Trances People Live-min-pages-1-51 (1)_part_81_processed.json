  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author writes about the challenges of overcoming a fear of intimacy and the cluttering of our inner space with past experiences and false beliefs. The key is to disidentify with these limiting beliefs and recognize oneself as the larger context in which life occurs. In the last 200 tokens, the concept of Deep Trance Phenomena is introduced as a means by which people shrink their sense of self down to limited states by misidentifying with beliefs.
