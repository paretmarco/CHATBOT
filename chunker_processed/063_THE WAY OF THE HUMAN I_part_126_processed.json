  "title": "How do External Contexts Affect Developmental Challenges Described in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the concept of Infantile Grandiosity in psychoanalytic developmental psychology and how external context can affect personal progress. It emphasizes that unprocessed issues manifest themselves in different developmental stages and how these stages bring up different uncooked seeds. To illustrate this, the author shares an example of a man who, during a Quantum Psychology training, age-regressed back to when he was starting school. The last 200 tokens highlight how each age presents unique challenges and developmental issues that people bring their past uncooked seeds to face. The author notes that these uncooked seeds can hinder personal growth and progress in different external contexts.",
  "content": "Normally I don't feel this way.\" I asked him how he felt and he said, \"I feel like I'm in school, like I'm five years old and just starting school.\" He was withdrawn, he was trying to disappear, he was not aware that he was trying to accumulate information. In fact, he was always complain- 72 Chapter V ing about about there being \"no hand-outs.\" He was \"acting out\" the False Core of, \"I do not exist\" (to be discussed later) and he was age-regressing back to being a five-year old facing the challenge of beginning school. It's when you start your social life, when you leave home and start going to school. In this way each age has a different context and a different developmental challenge to deal with, one in which you unknowingly bring your past uncooked seeds to meet (unsuccessfully) that new challenge. In other words, (see Volume II, Quantum Psychology and the False Cora-False Self), your uncooked seeds are taken with you to meet each new context. For that reason, each new external is not seen anew.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, as we go through life, we face different developmental challenges that are influenced by our past experiences. However, to truly experience a situation with a beginner's mind, it's important that we leave behind our past uncooked seeds and approach each new experience with a fresh perspective. By doing so, we can break free from the Associational Trance of the False Core and have a more fulfilling life."
