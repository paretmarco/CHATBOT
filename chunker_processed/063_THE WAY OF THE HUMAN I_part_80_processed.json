  "title": "\"What is the False Core and how can it be dismantled for a better understanding of self?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of False Core and how it drives our psychological movements, eventually leading to a subjective experience of one's psychology. The False Core is the organizing principle of one's entire psychology that needs to be cut to reveal true essence, \"I AM,\" VOID, etc. The last 200 tokens detail the process and the importance of tracing the False Core driver to dismantle it until it dissolves in the nonverbal \"I AM.\" It also highlights Quantum Psychology's Principle, which claims that who we are is beyond our attention fixation and observer-False Core Driver-False Self Defensive Compensator complex.",
  "content": "In Trances People Live, I called the False Core the Organizing Principle since it is the principle that 38 Chapter 11 organizes your entire psychology. When that False Core or Organizing Principle dissolves (a Yogi would call it \"cutting the knot of the heart\"), ESSENCE, I AM, VOID, etc., naturally emerge and are revealed. If you do not cut the False Core (knot of the heart, i.e., the associational networks), ESSENCE, the I AM and the awareness of the VOID (NOT-I-I) can never be stabilized in your awareness. TRACING THE FALSE CORE DRIVER To discovertyonr False Core, take notice of whatever it is you are experiencing and then trace it back by asking yourself, \"What is the worst of that or \"what about that is so bad?\" When you trace it back, you'll hit thebottom of one of them. Please note there are more False Cores than those described. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY' PRINCIPLE: Who you are is beyond even the way \"you\" fixate your attention. The way \"you\" fixate attention and all \"you\" call \"you\" are part of the observer-False Core Driver-False Self Defensive Compensator complex.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, discovering and cutting the False Core or Organizing Principle of the observer-False Core Driver-False Self Defensive Compensator complex in Quantum Psychology is crucial to unlocking the emergence and stabilization of ESSENCE, I AM, and awareness of the VOID. The observer is inseparable from the observed in both Quantum Physics and Psychology, emphasizing the importance of multi-dimensional awareness. Trace back your experiences by asking what is the worst of that, to identify your False Core, and ultimately reveal your true essence."
