  "title": "\"How Can We Distinguish Between Indispensable and Superfluous Activities Before Implementation?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article discusses the importance of distinguishing between indispensable and superfluous activities, and how to effectively implement them while retaining focus and productivity. It emphasizes the importance of the willpower of a person to analyze a problem before deciding on the means for its solution, and not to settle for anything that does not conform to one's personal line of conduct. In the last part, the author stresses the significance of smashing automatism by questioning the type of satisfaction sought, discovering new aspects of life, thus emphasizing the necessity of instantaneous or regular disposal of material waste.",
  "content": "We should not forget that, after all, while there are several things one cannot do, there is nothing which one is disabled from «not doing». This warning applies to all those people who, in order to justify themselves, refer to an irresistible impulse, only for them to later regret the fact they have acted recklessly. We come back in this regard to our main thesis, that is, the necessity of smashing automatism, by judging whether satisfaction has not been already experienced, and if experiencing it again in the same forms is truly worth the effort. We must ask ourselves: What kind of satisfaction I am seeking? Have I already tasted it in the past? Would it not be possible for me to rather discover something new? The instantaneous or periodical erasure of the superfluous aspects of our activity is a necessity, just as the daily or periodical disposal of material waste is a primary need of home economics.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, we must consciously break away from the automatic and meaningless aspects of our daily lives, including those negative emotions that weigh us down. When faced with a problem or desire to act, take a moment to analyze whether it needs to be solved or if it's simply arbitrary. By doing so, we can discover new sources of satisfaction and rid ourselves of unnecessary burdens. Remember, there is nothing we are disabled from not doing."
