This part of the course will teach you how to use trance states to alter the reality of a person and have them react in an unconscious way. We use only non-verbal communication, a few words, and obviously the power of the mind for this practice. It is a discipline that is very impressive not only to the client, but also to the practitioner, as we will show you how to do some amazing things during the training. Uses in real life of these skills are in: better understanding people at deeper levels than the verbal one, communicating with the unconscious mind, having reaction to non verbal symbols and intentions.
