  "title": "\"What is the connection between Archetypes, False Self, and The Observer in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the fourth and final chapter of \"The Way of the Human - Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the author reflects on the importance of going beyond archetypical representations to discover the true self. They note that spiritual or psychological archetypes, while manifestations of the Physics Dimension, can be obstacles on the path to self-realization. The chapter provides a review of the observer and its three aspects, as well as the consciousness and observing ego as described by Jung. The text reminds us that language can be limiting in our understanding of the self.",
  "content": "In order to discover the primordial you, THE SELF, the archetypical representations, which we do not know are archetypical, must be gone beyond. Why does acting-out of an Archetype get in the way of discovering WHO YOU ARE? Because the I which is doing and acting-out the Archetype is part of the Archetype. YOU are beyond all Archetypes or as Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"Anything you think you are you are not.\" 'It should be noted there is no where or location, but language is limiting in explaining what cannot be described. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter IV THE OBSERVER: A REVIEW As mentioned in Volume IL the observer initia y appears to have three aspects: It observes. Actually it is an observing ego in reference to the observing ego, Jung said that the consciousness while it is the \"ego\" needs to be differentiated from the \"observing ego\". The psyche not only includes the knowing ego but the ability to observe itself in the very process of knowing and being. It is a thought the ego has established, the fact that I am here, while the observing ego knows that I am here knowing that I am here.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly discover your self beyond all archetypes, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the observer and the observed. As quantum psychology suggests, they are not separate entities, but rather one and the same, arising and subsiding together. By recognizing this interconnectedness, one can transcend the limitations of language and gain a deeper understanding of their true nature."
