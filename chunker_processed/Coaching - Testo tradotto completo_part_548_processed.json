  "title": "How can we enlist the unconscious to turn our dreams into reality through conscious preparation, a life plan, and action?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous parts of this text, we discussed the importance of acquiring consciousness of our actions and augmenting one's energy to attain our ideals, followed by creating a feasible plan with alternative imaginations to achieve it. In this final part, we will focus on utilizing tools like instantaneous mono-ideation and self-observation to become a magnet and aid the universe in manifesting our goals. We will also explore concepts like neuric force, kairòs, and the accumulation of reality to understand the power of our thoughts and actions. Glossary term definitions are provided to aid in comprehension.",
  "content": "Key points PREPARATION Acquiring consciousness of our own selves and our actions Reining in the dispersion of the mental and the emotional dimensions Exercises aimed at augmenting one’s energy Nurturing originality (technique of the light) Reaching a state of centralization of one’s self Nurturing one’s own energy and physical vitality LIFE PLAN Identifying the underlying “Ideas” of one’s own self and its relationship with the universe Defining the “ideals” which one should aspire to in the life plan as they apply to the various frameworks of the self: Relationships, success, etc Verifying our own conscious awareness of these ideals and ideas by resorting to such techniques as the “inner code” (yes/no ideomotor responses) Moving to the stage of practical ideation: “Dreaming up the means”, that is, a feasible path which might enable the attainment of one’s ideal Extrapolating from this itinerary the annual, monthly, weekly and daily plans Giving birth to alternative imaginations (in other words, what we would do if obstacles interposed themselves or in the event that everything unfolded itself in an optimal way) Defining in a clear manner the aspects of the daily plan Engaging in periodical review of the plans and in retrospective analysis ACTION Utilizing the instruments of the “instantaneous mono-ideation” and “observing one’s own action”, along with all the other recommendations (mirror, etc) BECOMING A MAGNET Carrying out the techniques (light, Indian self-hypnosis, and so on) in order to change one’s behaviour and assist the universe’s task in allowing us to attain our goal Glossary Accumulation of reality: A series of events which head in the same direction Chronos: Time in its planned, programmed sense, as such opposed to “kairòs”, which is the time for seizing opportunities Neuric or nervous force: Our energy potential, which is essential for us to act Kairòs: The time that is punctuated by opportunities we must be able to seize in our life; it stands in contraposition to chronos, which is the time of planning Ideal: What we wish to achieve Ideation: The act of conceiving an idea in the mind or linking it to time Self or ego: Our individual self which consists in fixed habits and patterns of behaviour, and which is connected to its own “comfort zone” Mono-ideation: The capacity to bring our mind to the point where is conceives one thing only, and to focus on such a thing so as to attain it Multiplication: A mental operation whereby what we fix in our minds is made to relate to our whole being and to become “multiplied” as strength.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, achieving our goals requires a conscious effort to centralize our self, nurture our energy, and create a clear life plan. This plan should encompass our ideals and ideas, and be broken down into feasible steps with periodic review. By utilizing techniques like instantaneous mono-ideation and becoming a magnet, we can increase our neuric force and become more successful in achieving our desired outcomes. Remember to practice multiplication and presentification to strengthen the power of our minds."
