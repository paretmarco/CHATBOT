  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the Quantum Psychology exercise continues with steps 8-13 to help individuals let go of false beliefs about themselves and reality. The False Core label is removed and the \"BIG EMPTINESS\" is appreciated as energy, allowing the individual to see that the False Core is simply a condensation of the same substance. The exercise encourages individuals to split their awareness and focus on the awareness of their thoughts and emotions while also recognizing and embracing the void of undifferentiated consciousness. Through this process, the individual can move beyond their limited concepts of self and embrace pure awareness.",
  "content": "It is the idea about \"me\" or \"you\" or the concept of mine. The more concepts you look at and get processed and go beyond, the more the NOT-I-I of pure awareness gets stabilized in the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS moves to foreground, and the \"you\" you call yourself disappears. Notice the cosmic super-imposition whereby the NOT-I becomes the \"I\" and the \"I\" becomes the NOT-I superimposed as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condenses. The mind is like a computer; at some point, ideas end (are downloaded). It is difficult to stabilize and get this NOT-I since all your attention is on the computer software and because the \"I\" can- 162 Chapter W not stabilize because the \"I\" is not it. Beate Walter of the Institute for Applied Physiology in Freiburg Germany said it this way: You are enquiring, noting what comes up on the computer screen, downloading it and then discarding the program. Notice what concepts come up on your computer screen and push the delete button. Quantum Psychology urges you to recognize what you are resisting awareness of. EXERCISE #8 Guided Exercise 1.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing awareness and observation of concepts and ideas can help stabilize the state of pure awareness and dissolve the illusion of the ego. By recognizing what we resist and letting go of limiting beliefs and perceptions, we can access the void of undifferentiated consciousness and experience the unity of all things. Try the guided exercise above to begin exploring your own consciousness."
