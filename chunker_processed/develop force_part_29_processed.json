  "title": "Can Muscle Tension and Gaze Help Develop Fascinative Force and Presence?",
  "first_phrase": "This concluding text discusses the importance of developing one's fascination abilities by focusing on exercises that can enhance one's physical and mental capacities. Earlier in the text, it is explained how muscle tension can lead to increased energy and brain coherence, and how a certain individual's magnetic presence can exert a significant impact on others. The text also delves into the concept of the third eye, which is believed to have intuitive powers that, when awakened through effort and self-improvement, can lead to greater consciousness. In this final section, several exercises are detailed, including muscle fixity and attention building, in order to help develop one's gaze and focus.",
  "content": "Besides, to more simple level, muscle tension stimulates the brain and creates a similar mental tension, able to enhance your thought. Exercise 23 Inhale and stretch arms before in front and then alongside, but not the hands, they remain relaxed. Exhale slowly. Repeat several times. Exercise 3 Lefebure \"experiences initiatiques\" Rise up on your toes inhaling; meanwhile clench fists, but only those, arms should be relaxed. This exercise develops, if performed inhaling and thinking of the word \"energy\", energy and strength. Muscle Fixity exercises In addition to the simple tension, it is also important to control the muscle strength. On muscular level, we will develop now fixity and attention. Exercise 4 This exercise builds fixity and self-confidence. Stretch out the right arm horizontally toward your right, and at the same time turn head to the right, staring intensely your fingertips. Little by little, prolong the duration of the exercise. You have to alternate arms. Complicate the exercise, holding a glass of water in your hand and staring intensely at the water level, which you have to keep as steady as you can. This exercise is also present in Count Kowalski‘s \"A system of Caucasian Yoga\". Develop attention and gaze To lead another one, we must first be able to lead ourselves. A wandering mind accomplishes very little. Be able to maintain attention means being able to keep mind’s \"focus\" on what one wishes to realize or in any case in a specific direction. It is a skill that once acquired is self-keeping.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, developing the power of attention and concentration of thought through exercises such as muscle tension, fixation, and gazing can have a significant impact on one's mental abilities. By practicing these exercises, one can improve their concentration, self-confidence, and persuasive abilities. The rule of \"three times ten minutes\" can be used to incorporate these exercises into daily life without stealing time. Lastly, it is important to remember not to exhaust oneself in an effort to prolong an exercise and to switch to a different exercise if needed."
