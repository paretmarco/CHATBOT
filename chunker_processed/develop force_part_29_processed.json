  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of developing the \"Fascinative Force\" through exercises that aim to increase muscle tension, vibration and brain coherence, among other things. Before introducing these exercises, the text delves into the psychological aspects of magnetic attraction, describing how magnetic people seem to generate a feeling of well-being and eurhythmy in those around them. The text also discusses the concept of the third eye as a source of intuition and perception, and how it can be awakened through individual effort and mental training. The following exercises focus on developing muscle fixity and attention, as well as enhancing the ocular's power.",
  "content": "Besides, to more simple level, muscle tension stimulates the brain and creates a similar mental tension, able to enhance your thought. Exercise 23 Inhale and stretch arms before in front and then alongside, but not the hands, they remain relaxed. Exhale slowly. Repeat several times. Exercise 3 Lefebure \"experiences initiatiques\" Rise up on your toes inhaling; meanwhile clench fists, but only those, arms should be relaxed. This exercise develops, if performed inhaling and thinking of the word \"energy\", energy and strength. Muscle Fixity exercises In addition to the simple tension, it is also important to control the muscle strength. On muscular level, we will develop now fixity and attention. Exercise 4 This exercise builds fixity and self-confidence. Stretch out the right arm horizontally toward your right, and at the same time turn head to the right, staring intensely your fingertips. Little by little, prolong the duration of the exercise. You have to alternate arms. Complicate the exercise, holding a glass of water in your hand and staring intensely at the water level, which you have to keep as steady as you can. This exercise is also present in Count Kowalski‘s \"A system of Caucasian Yoga\". Develop attention and gaze To lead another one, we must first be able to lead ourselves. A wandering mind accomplishes very little. Be able to maintain attention means being able to keep mind’s \"focus\" on what one wishes to realize or in any case in a specific direction. It is a skill that once acquired is self-keeping.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing attention and concentration of thought through exercises such as fixity, muscle tension, and fixation exercises can lead to a deeper level of consciousness and provide numerous benefits in daily life, study, work, and even in hypnotic situations. By practicing presence and the exercises presented here, one can become more aware of their body and their surroundings, allowing for a more profound sense of being present in the moment. Remember to practice regularly, but not to exhaust yourself in the process, and you will see a significant improvement in your attention and related abilities."
