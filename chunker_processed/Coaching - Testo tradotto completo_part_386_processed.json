  "title": "How can you develop your will to power and influence others through your actions and communication?",
  "first_phrase": "The author emphasizes the importance of mastering the will to power in order to exercise a truly miraculous influence over others. The majority of people only desire, rather than truly willing, and have never developed their power and will. However, desire can still prove useful as an outer shell for absolute will. In order to induce a state of watchful vigilance in others, the author suggests looking directly at the person, including their eyes, nose, or glands. Varying the spot of focus can help maintain attention while presenting proposals.",
  "content": "What it means is that its benefit can at best emerge at a later time, as a secondary spin-off, at the time, that is, when you will have learnt how to “create” such desire in yourselves, how to almost recite it out instead of being victims thereof. In order to induce the spirit into a state of watchful vigil, such a desire would then act sometimes as the outer shell for what shall inwardly exist as absolute will. When you are talking: Whenever you accost somebody, you should always make sure to look straight at him. You might legitimately look into his eyes, as well as at the base of his nose, at the space between his eyes, or at his glands. Besides, in the event that you need to stare at him for a long time, you might change the spot you are going to direct your look to, from one slightly above the eyes to another one slightly below them, taking care however not to stop looking at that person, at least not before you have completed the presentation to him of the proposal you would want him to accept.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the art of creating desire within oneself can lead to the emergence of benefits as a secondary spin-off. To effectively communicate with others, it's important to accost them with a direct look and use a handshake to communicate mental orders. Coordinating your look with your thought and expressed words is also crucial to avoid conflicting feelings. Remember to stay focused in conversations and discussions to ensure clarity of thought and effective communication."
