  "title": "\"How can you go beyond false beliefs and reach pure awareness in the void of consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores a meditative practice to distance oneself from a \"False Core\" by observing and feeling its essential qualities and recognizing the emptiness it is floating in. Step-by-step instructions are provided, including noticing triggers, recognizing the difference between \"you\" and the False Core, and feeling the essential qualities of the emptiness. In the last 200 tokens, the text instructs the reader to appreciate the False Core as a condensation of the BIG EMPTINESS and to split their awareness to observe any arising thoughts or feelings without identification.",
  "content": "(Here we notice the BIG EMPTINESS--the NOT 14-Iâ€”that the False Core and its associations are floating in.] Step 8: Take the label off the False Core and the entire chain while you notice the BIG EMPTINESS the chain is floating in. Step 9:Have that as energy. Step 10:Appreciate that the False Core is just a condensation of the BIG EMPTINESS (or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condensing down). Step 11: See the energy now and the BIG EMPTINESS itself as being made of the same substance. Step 12:Notice what occurs. Step 13:Keeping that level of awareness, split your awareness so that part of your awareness is in the BIG EMPTINESS and another part can see whatever may or may not come up in the condensation of that EMPTINESS. In other words, should the EMPTINESS condense down and become a thought or feeling, simply notice what that is. Whenever you are ready, let your eyes open and have part of your awareness here in this room. At some point, you will see that there is an end to the number of ideas you have about (fill in the blank).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey of self-discovery involves recognizing the false core and the emptiness in which it floats, appreciating its true nature, and seeing everything as made of the same substance. By splitting your awareness and letting go of concepts, you can stabilize the not-I of pure awareness and dissolve the illusion of self. Just like a computer, the mind eventually reaches a limit of ideas, and you can experience the cosmic super-imposition of the not-I becoming the I and vice versa. Remember, this is a gradual and ongoing process, so be patient with yourself and continue to practice."
