  "title": "\"What is Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to the concept of I AM?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the text explores the concept of Quantum Psychology, which helps stabilize consciousness in the I AM state. It is rooted in WHO AM I? and does not involve changing or reprogramming beliefs. The focus is dismantling psychology and spirituality to go beyond the frames of reference to the NON-VERBAL I AM. The text references Nisargadatta Maharaj's approach to get people to go beyond their ideas and find their true selves. The concluding exercises entail asking oneself, \"Who came first? You or (fill in the blank)?\"",
  "content": "Psychology's failure is in trying to change the abstractions of the nervous system, which is a later abstraction of an abstraction trying to change an earlier abstraction, rather than letting them be or dissolve so that the beingness of I AM can naturally emerge. The NON-VERBAL I AM—which should not be confused with the verbal I AM—is prior to meaning. If you can stabilize in the NON-VERBAL I AM—stay there. If you cannot, Quantum Psychology might help you to stabilize there through dismantling not changing, reframing, re-forming, re-programming, healing or transforming your psychology (i.e., your False Core Driver or False Core Compensator). Quantum Psychology is rooted in WHO AM I?—not changing, reframing, reprogramming or copying (modeling). Spirituality, too, has the same roots in WHO AM I? Advaita Vedanta, therefore, fulfills psychology's purpose of the realization of WHO YOU ARE (i.e., THAT ONE SUBSTANCE through the Vedanta of Not This-Not This). CONCLUDING EXERCISES Nisargadatta Maharaj was really into the I AM, and he never mentioned ESSENCE. To get people to go prior to their ideas Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, \"Who came first? You or (fill in the blank)?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the realization of WHO YOU ARE, beyond the abstractions of psychology, is rooted in the understanding of the NON-VERBAL I AM, which is prior to meaning. Quantum Psychology and Advaita Vedanta can help you stabilize in the I AM state and dissolve false core drivers, leading to true self-realization. Meditate on yourself prior to any thoughts and focus on the difference between I AM and NOT-I-IT to experience the BIG EMPTINESS."
