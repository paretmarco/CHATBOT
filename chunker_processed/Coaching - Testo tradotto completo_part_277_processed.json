  "first_phrase": "This text offers practical advice on how to stay organized and prioritize tasks. It describes two versions of a daily planner: a simplified one where tasks are listed in order of execution and checked off as they are completed, and a comprehensive one where a double page is devoted to each day. This approach involves breaking down tasks according to their priority, scheduling recurring or long-term tasks in advance, and noting the sequential order in which each task should be executed. The text's last 200 tokens provide specific ways to structure the comprehensive planner, including numbering or timing tasks for optimal sequencing.",
  "content": "That is due to the fact that, in that way, such operations are going to be carried out in a sequential order, whereas, otherwise, there might be a tendency to postpone the more complex actions sine die. Having recourse to the method of writing, we will mark down in the morning the sequential order in which the first operations of the day will have to be carried out. In the event of the supervening emergence of some new operation for the day, such new operation will be noted down below the list of the other operations. It might possibly happen that this operation which has been noted down last will be required to be carried out prior to some of the previously listed ones. The said numbering of it would then only serve the purpose of marking its natural place, that is to say, the most suitable moment to execute it. Other people might draw advantage from the stratagem of simply noting down, in the apposite small column, the hour in which each operation has to be carried out, as opposed to its sequential number. One is after all dealing with one and the same concept, namely, how to demarcate the right place for every particular operation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, having a clear and organized plan for carrying out tasks can greatly increase productivity and efficiency. Whether using a sequential order or marking tasks by time, keeping track of what has been completed and adjusting the order as needed can help ensure that all necessary operations are accomplished in a timely and effective manner. Remember to consider mental attitude and prioritize accordingly, to get the most out of every day."
