  "title": "What are the Archetypes of Electromagnetics and the Collective?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Louise discussed her experience with Electromagnetics and its impact on her life. In this final part, therapist Stephen Wolinsky explores the Archetypes of the Electromagnetic Mechanism and the Collective. Louise shares her experience with a powerful, coiled field that she feels in her chest, which she believes was implanted in her from another dimension. This implant has had a significant impact on how Louise organizes her life, causing her to isolate and limit herself. Wolinsky encourages Louise to look beyond these archetypes to move forward in her spiritual path.",
  "content": "107 Wolinsky:What assumptions do you have about Electro- magnetics creating a field with a coil? Louise:I have to work to keep my body balanced, it was something that was done to me. Wolinsky:Because of this structure, what impact has it had on how you have organized your life? Louise:I do body and energy work for a living, I alter my life around energy and electgro-magnetics. Wolinsky:Regarding this Electro-magnetics field and the coil what have you done to yourself? Louise:Isolated and limited my life. Wolinsky:How does this Electro-magnetics coil seem to you now? Louise:Like an implant from another dimension. Therapeutic Note Here we see many Archetypes, for example, Gurdjieff refers to the Kundabuffer, a mechanism which makes everything the opposite of what it is. Other new age \"spiritual\" systems use this implant concept. It should be noted that this is not a put-down but an opportunity to look at what Archetypical Physics Dimension structures which organize your \"spiritual path\" in order to go beyond them. Wolinsky:Regarding the Coilâ€”Electra-magnetics implant how have you deceived yourself? Louise:Believing it is or has power.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, this conversation highlights the impact of electro-magnetics on Louise's life and how she has organized herself around it. The therapeutic note provides an opportunity to examine archetypes and dismantle limiting beliefs. Moving forward, it's important to acknowledge and explore the mechanisms that may be deceiving us, rather than pretending they aren't there."
