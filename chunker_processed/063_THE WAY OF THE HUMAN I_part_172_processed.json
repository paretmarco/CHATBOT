  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author talked about the collapsing of different dimensions and the concept of \"crazy wisdom\" in Tibetan tradition. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the author explores the Associational Trance and how it affects the mind's tendency to create generalizations and associations. They use the example of someone with anorexia bulimia to explain how past, present, and future body images get associated and fused with the external. The author also mentions a woman who was fixated on a guru in India and how it relates to the fusion of the VOID and narcissism. Overall, the text delves into the complexities of human consciousness and how it affects our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.",
  "content": "He gave over his \"lineage\"—as if a person could give a lineage—to a person who had AIDS and spread AIDS through their community. When they went to him and said, \"Why did you do this?\" he said, \"I thought I was the Dorje [an enlightened lineage holder]. I thought I couldn't transmit AIDS.\" Here you are talking about a think- The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness ing/emotional and biological dimension's collapsing with his understanding or experience of the VOID. It's a collapsing of the levels. THE ASSOCIATIONAL TRANCE: COLLAPSING THE LEVELS \"The concept of patterns only exist because of the Associational Trance\" The tendency of the mind, which is a by-product of the nervous system to scan-searching, seek and thus create generalizations and associations where there are none, is the mind's associational trance. When someone has had a trauma, for example, a past body image, a present body image and a future body image get associated together and fused with the external. For example, let's say someone has anorexia bulimia. They are hallucinating. They look in the mirror and do not see this skinny little person.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is vital to understand the concept of the Associational Trance and how it affects the mind's tendency to create generalizations and associations where there may be none. The collapsing of levels between the emotional, biological, and thinking dimensions are common in people who have undergone trauma. The Quantum Psychology Principle reminds us that the image we have of our body is not our actual body, and it is crucial to differentiate between the two to avoid confusion and misunderstanding."
