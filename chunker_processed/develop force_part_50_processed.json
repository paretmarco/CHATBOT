  "title": "\"What are the exercises for hemispheres and how do they relate to polarities in humans?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores exercises for hemispheric coordination and the awakening of the central fire, which are symbolically linked to polarities in humans. It discusses a possible pre-Roman school in Italy that focuses on the development of the power of gaze and breath, and how this relates to the eye, represented by the Etruscan winged deity. The last 200 tokens present specific exercises to awaken the central fire and develop fascination, including exercises to improve perception, attention, and concentration. It also discusses the need to overcome dualistic vision and polarity and provides an exercise called \"hot water and cold water\" to modify perceptions and reverse physical polarity.",
  "content": "Since tails belong in their form, to the aqueous element, symbol in its entirety (though we do not have evidence of the matter) may easily represent the exercise that follows: from the meeting of two different aqueous energies and the energy of breathing you extract the power (represented by the sword). To do this you must work at both physical and energetic level. Dominate polarities with the hot water/cold water exercise To develop the basic energy we must therefore be able to overcome polarities. Polarities are also expressions of a dualistic vision of the world, a product of our mind and our ego that has learned to interpret the sensory data according to pre-established patterns. How many people complain constantly! Being influenced by world distinctions, beautiful/ugly, pleasant/unpleasant etcâ€¦ this means virtually to live in a reality built from the outside and based on the concepts. The magnetic man builds instead his world and his reality. Moreover, the first point where we must surpass us is in ourselves. We must be able to build our world and live our reality. A way to access each symbol is represented by the sensorial experience. A major exercise called \"hot water and cold water\". It consists in Dennis, Etruria, vol. ii. p. 160 This exercise is among the first, if not the first in the tradition of Virgilio t. modify perceptions, to reverse the physical polarity of perception of the water element. This exercise works physiologically to hemispheric level, since each hand is tied to a different hemisphere.",
  "last_phrase": "To develop our spiritual potential, we must overcome polarities and build our own reality. One way to access symbols is through sensorial experiences, such as the \"hot water and cold water\" exercise. By developing a stronger center and practicing exercises like the \"glance\" and visual memory, we can awaken our abilities and powers using the key of light. While these tools are necessary for those with spiritual purposes, they are also practical for anyone looking to improve their mental and physical well-being. Remember to eliminate tension and not indulge too much in passive imagination to avoid being dominated by appearing images."
