  "content": "Con essa possiamo legare al momento presente ogni espressione e stato d'animo che possiamo creare I connettori I connnettori sono espressioni con i quali possiamo legare le frasi che diciamo. Vi sono connettori che continuano il flusso di pensiero come \"e\", e connettori che interrompono il flusso di pesniero come \"ma\".

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the importance of connectors can make a significant impact on how effectively we communicate. With connectors, we can tie every expression and mood to the present moment. There are connectors that help continue the flow of our thoughts, such as \"and,\" and connectors that interrupt the flow of our thoughts, like \"but.\" When we use the expression \"but,\" we cancel out what was said before and activate a new connection. By using the appropriate connectors, we can ensure that our message is clear and impactful."
