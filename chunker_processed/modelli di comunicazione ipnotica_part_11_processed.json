Names and concepts mentioned include the use of interruptions, the word \"now,\" induced searches in the mind, unconscious triggering, and the art of being vaguer.",
  "content": "Con essa possiamo legare al momento presente ogni espressione e stato d'animo che possiamo creare I connettori I connnettori sono espressioni con i quali possiamo legare le frasi che diciamo. Vi sono connettori che continuano il flusso di pensiero come \"e\", e connettori che interrompono il flusso di pesniero come \"ma\". Quando utilizziamo l'espressione \"ma\" cancelliamo quanto espresso poco prima ed attiviamo una nuova connessione",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and utilizing connectors in our language can greatly enhance our ability to effectively communicate our thoughts and emotions. By using phrases such as \"e\" to continue the flow of thoughts or \"ma\" to create a new connection, we can effectively convey our messages to others. With the ability to link expressions and emotions to the present moment, expressing ourselves can become easier and more meaningful. It is important to pay attention to the impact and intended outcome of these connectors when communicating with others."
