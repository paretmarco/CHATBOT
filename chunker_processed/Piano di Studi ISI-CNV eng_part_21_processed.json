  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves into the techniques and concepts involved in the Quantum Extreme ® system developed by the school of Mesmerismus. The content is divided into two segments: \"Fascination – Magnetic Path\" and \"Quantum Presence – Master in Quantum Physiology – Magnetic Path,\" both part of the Magnetic Path system. These paths aim to develop higher self-awareness and practical skills that can improve professional and personal outcomes. In addition to these paths, the course offers insights into the application of quantum principles in mental transformations and creative processes, among other topics.",
  "content": "Therefore applies the uncertainty principle, the superposition of quantum states etc ... Techniques and concepts - A small glossary We have developed many new techniques and applications. In specific Quantum Psi has been connected to the system LuxMind in the unique and powerful paradigm of Quantum Extreme ®. Here is a short glossary of some of the key concepts of the techniques of Quantum Extreme ®: 1. Mental initialization: is the determination of the starting point of a transformation or a creative process of our mind 2. Register of mental states and possible informations: determining the number of possible states, that is the starting point for quantum operations and the creation of a coherent superposition. At this point, our unconscious mind can begin to operate 3. Interference from one item to the other: the act of an element on the set of transformations (calculations) quantum. Examples of interference are for example those made by symbolic elements. 4. Quantum Correlation/Entanglement: the fact that the two elements can come into contact and subsequently maintain a ratio (entanglement) between them. This concept applies even to magnetism, where people entangle at a distance and create distant reactions 5. Equilibrium/Balance is the central position that eliminates dissipative situations 6. Amplification of mental coherence The use of elements and rhythms that amplify the extreme quantum mode. 7. Reducing information: the reduction of the amount of information to a single element 8. Implicated order and explicate order: the two positions 9. Coherence and Decoherence of neuronal information: We need concentration.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Extreme ® is a powerful technology that incorporates the concepts of quantum mechanics and allows for mental initialization, coherence, and amplification. Through the techniques of NLP-3, Hypnotic Communication, and Quantum Coaching, individuals can develop their potential, reach their goals, and achieve success in various aspects of their lives. By integrating non-verbal communication, Enneagram, and quantum thinking, these courses offer a unique approach to coaching and personal development. Moreover, the international certification received at the end of these courses can serve as a valuable asset for those pursuing careers in coaching or related fields."
