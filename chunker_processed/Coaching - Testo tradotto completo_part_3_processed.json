  "content": "This work is the key to achieve success in any field of life, be it personal relationship, financial activity, or business, while at the same time staying loyal to our innermost being, so as to be truly ourselves and simultaneously put our talents to profitable use. INTRODUCTION Whatever is bereft of a purpose is no more than mere agitation (A. C. Brackett). If we want to achieve results in life, we do not have to do more. Rather, we have to do things better and in a more targeted, purposeful manner. If you put into practice the teachings of this book, you will reach the point where “you make less effort and yet you produce more”. Success and happiness are always in front of us. All we need is learning how to stir into motion our vital energy, and how to steer it in the right direction, in order to enable it to yield positive results. The Universe is no more than a response structure. It is commensurately with the way in which we interact with the Universe that whatever we wrest from it emerges into existence. We are able therefore to extract results, provided we adopt the right posture.",

By implementing the teachings of this book and staying true to our innermost being, we can produce more with less effort, while reaping the rewards of our efforts."
