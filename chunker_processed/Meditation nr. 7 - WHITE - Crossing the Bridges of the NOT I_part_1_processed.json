  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we explored the concept of transcendence and its corresponding quality of clairvoyance. Now, we move further into the realm of energetic rising and accessing higher levels of intuition with the ninth castle exercise. By visualising a tree connected to divine consciousness, we can allow natural energy to flow through our bodies and open ourselves up to new experiences. The next exercise involves creating mental circles and focusing on different parts of the body, thus accessing the temple within ourselves where the grail resides. Read on to learn more about this powerful meditation technique.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by meditating and practicing these exercises, we can awaken the energy within us and transcend ourselves beyond time and space. We can access higher levels of consciousness and enhance our intuition and inner vision. Through the Glass Bridge and the Rotating Bridge, we learn to let go of our former reality and prepare for the Tournament. By entering the Crystal Palace, we can activate transcendental vision and experience inner lights, vivid dreams, and increased visual acuity. These practices require courage, but they can lead us to enlightenment and a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us."
