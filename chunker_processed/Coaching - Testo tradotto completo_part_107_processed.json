  "title": "\"How can strict mental discipline and emotional self-control lead to elevated mental power?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of strict mental discipline in developing elevated mental power. The precept of \"Think over\" is introduced as a technique to practice such discipline, requiring concentration on the target of meditation and avoiding extraneous thoughts. The author also stresses the need for mental balance and emotional self-control as preconditions for productive creativity. By persevering in self-consciousness and self-presencing, individuals can achieve a harmonious state and empower themselves to progress.",
  "content": "Putting it even better, every series of thoughts must gather around a dominant question, the solution to which is adopted as one’s purpose. The man who is prey to his thoughts occasionally has some ideas, which lack however orientation to the right direction. Mental balance and the relinquishment of worries represent the dual precondition for the productive exteriorization of geniality and intuition. The very first effort must accordingly aim at achieving emotional self-control, i.e. at reacting calmly to the small irritations of everyday life. The first thing to do when you wake up in the morning is to say to yourselves: “Regardless of whatever might happen, I want to stay calm, in charge of myself, and in a state of balance. I am appointing my person as my own guard, and finding my centre in my own self”. As you persevere and develop self-consciousness and self-presencing, you will eventually come to develop a harmonious state. Having achieved that, your mind might then be led to create through the medium of specific methodologies, and every new creation of your mind will empower you to progress.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving emotional self-control and maintaining mental balance are the essential factors for productively externalizing our creativity and intuition. By making a conscious effort to stay calm and centered, we can sharpen our focus and awaken our creative mind. The exercise involving light is a powerful tool that can enable us to reach our highest potential and inspire new ideas. Let us remember to appoint ourselves as our own guards and find our center within ourselves each day."
