  "title": "How Can Understanding Communication Styles, Non-Verbal Language, and Enneagram Types Improve Relationships and Rapport-Building?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the various aspects of non-verbal communication and its impact on human behavior. It discusses the different communication styles and their correlation with sensorial channels such as visual, auditory and coenaesthesis. The last part of the text delves into the topic of developing a rapport with people by understanding their behavior patterns, values, and preferences. It also explains the concept of incomplete and complete individuals, and how one can reach a new equilibrium by analyzing the channels that are used most frequently. The section concludes with the importance of using all three channels (action, intellect, and emotion) to communicate effectively.",
  "content": "We can therefore reaffirm the concept that if we want to establish a rapport, we need to understand our interlocutorâ€™s strategy and use it ourselves. However, apart from this, it is important not to leave out any channel. If instead, we discuss a person that does not use one of three channels, we are talking about an incomplete person. The three channels are: ACTION (VISUAL) INTELLECT (AUDITORY) EMOTION (COENEATHESIS) HOWEVER, THEY ALL NEED TO BE USED SHOWING A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OR TWO OF THEM. Further definitions We can define: INCOMPLETE is someone who does not use the third channel COMPLETE is someone who uses all three channels even if infrequently. We can consider that person an intermediate stage. ESSENCE is when someone combines all three channels. They can choose all of them, or more correctly they can choose any strategy. (For example: the condition of a baby, who can do everything, is essence). Therefore, that person can use the right and left hemispheres (creativity and logic) in equal measures. Everything you have read until now serves at a personal level, helping you to communicate better. Moreover, it is a very efficient therapy tool, for it allows us to have a picture of the person who needs his/ her problems resolved. Subsequently, when analyzing the channel used most frequently and that used less frequently, you can open the way to a new equilibrium.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the communication channels and personality profiles outlined in the enneagram can greatly improve personal and professional relationships. By delving deeper into the psychology of ourselves and others, we can establish instant rapport and communicate more effectively. Hypnosis and NLP techniques can also aid in this communication process, allowing us to better control our thoughts and emotions. By utilizing these tools, we can develop a more balanced personality, become better team players, and ultimately achieve greater success in our personal and professional lives."
