  "title": "\" How can we eliminate wasteful actions, thoughts and words to direct our energy towards fulfillment?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the importance of eliminating wasteful thoughts and actions to optimize our time and vital energy. In the last 200 tokens, the authors emphasize the need to first achieve control over oneself and direct vital energy towards our personal ideals. The text covers the impact of thoughts and emotions on our energy and relationships, and the need to focus on activating vital energy through goal setting and seizing opportunities. The ultimate goal is to be present in our relationship with the Universe to enjoy and multiply life.",
  "content": "If, by contrast, we attain control over emotions instead of letting ourselves be carried along by events, we might be able to define them. Such a new attitude has an impact on our life and our relationships with third parties. In that manner, you will develop and increase your own “natural magnetism”, and you will become more aware both of your own selves and your vital energy, whereby you will begin to set out towards the fulfilment of your personal ideals. SECOND POINT – Directing energy towards time Once we have achieved control over our own selves, we find that an essential aspect consists in activating our vital energy and allowing it to fully express itself in the realm of the outward. In this connection, there are two possible directions towards which our vital energy might flow: One, which is linear in nature, is represented by programming and focusing mentally on the goals to achieve, whereas the other one is represented by living in the moment and being present to opportunities. We are not only called upon to enjoy life, but also to multiply it. The first key enabling us to fulfil that goal is being present to our own relationship with the Universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving control over our emotions and directing our vital energy towards our goals and present opportunities can lead us to a position of control and awareness in our lives. By actively pursuing our personal ideals and being present in the moment, we can unlock our own \"natural magnetism\" and allow the Universe to respond to us, ultimately leading us to fulfilling our potential and achieving success. So, let's take action and embrace the power we have within ourselves to shape our lives."
