  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the reasons why people work hard in their respective fields. It provides insight into the motivation behind one's behavior and whether it stems from feelings of inadequacy or a desire to prove oneself. The last 200 tokens emphasize that analyzing others is often a defense mechanism that distracts from addressing one's own false self. The focus should rather be on dismantling the false core and realizing that it is not what defines us. Quantum Psychology is a continuous process that involves studying and disassembling one's false core in pairs or group settings.",
  "content": "He feels \"inadequate\"and is trying to prove he is \"smart and adequate.\" 5. He feels \"non-existent\" and is trying to \"prove he exists.\" 6. He feels \"alone\" and is trying to \"connect\" with other professionals. Chapter 11 7. He feels \"incomplete\" and is trying to \"fill in the missing pieces.\" 8. He feels \"powerless\" and wants to be \"powerful.\" 9. He feels \"no love\" and is \"seeking love\" through work. I think too much emphasis is placed on trying to analyze and figure out others. This is oftentimes yet another defense and distraction of the False SoIf trying to distract away from the False Core and the shock of the Realization of Separation. Emphasis could be better placed on what your False Core-False Self is and how to dismantle it and realize IT IS NOT YOU. Quantum Psychology is an on,going internal process. In Quantum Psychology people are continually being brought back into their False Core, studying it and working in pairs or groups to dismantle it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, rather than focusing on analyzing others, it's more productive to concentrate on understanding and dismantling your False Core-False Self. Quantum Psychology offers an ongoing internal process for identifying and tracing the False Core, as well as a series of protocols to work on the False Core-False Self polarity. Remember, any subjective experience of being a teacher is a sign of the False Core-False Self complex, so the focus should always be on dismantling and realizing that it is not you."
