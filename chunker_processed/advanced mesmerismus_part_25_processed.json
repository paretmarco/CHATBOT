  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this extensive text, we will explore various hypnosis techniques and their applications. Before that, on the fifth day, we delved into Hermeticism and Quantum Physics and explored symbols such as the circle, the salt symbol, and the elements. We also saw an exercise to understand the explicate and implicate orders and an exercise to put away emotions and become aware of the space between thoughts. In the following parts, we will learn about techniques for smoking cessation, allergy treatment, weight loss, and dealing with burn-out. The afternoon session will cover different levels of moving therapy, magnetic voice, the Trabona method, and the hypnodrama method. Finally, we will discuss true and derivative symbolism and how our relationships can impact the original archetypal symbolism.",
  "content": "There is a relationship between hermeticism, magnetism and quantum physics Schopenauer is in fact the key because he highly influenced the group of scientists that was at the basis of the \"quantum paradygm\" exercise =========================================================== TRUE AND DERIVATIVE SYMBOLISM The symbols as the vertical, the circle, are primitive and archetipal symbols Jung had called them \"archetypes\" But there is a \"derivate somnambulism\" that is based on the original symbol that can take MEANINGS from experiences an example is the symbol of the cross. It is an archetype, but in the christian Religion it takes further meaning Another exemple are the symbol of the MOTHER and the FATHER They are archetypes, but they get psychologically coloured. We have the true symbol, but education can \"CHARGE\" in some way the symbol. Even our hands can express symbolism. Pointing hand - directive and indicative Open hand - receiving and harmonizing Small distant touch - in some way we stay \"detached\" Archetyply, the Pointing hand many types is related to the father/male figure, the receiveing hand to the mother/female figure The psychology of our relationships with these figures will give \"colour\" to the original archetypical symbolism (Benemeglio). It means the person will search or refuse some kind of touches Furter traumatism can lead the person in not wanting any touch. We must always work experimentally. We have three styles of hypnotherapy and touch Directive Mother Detached These three types are also in Virginia Satir that observed the existence of three types.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, symbolism and touch have a significant impact on our psychology and relationship with others. Understanding our preferences for hypnotherapy touch and adapting to our clients can lead to a successful treatment. The Enneagram also provides insight into our compulsion and allowing us to shed our masks. Finally, practicing clairvoyance and Indian Self Hypnosis can increase our inner sensitivity and manifest our desires in the universe. With patience, experimentation, and openness to different approaches, we can cultivate a more profound understanding of ourselves and others."
