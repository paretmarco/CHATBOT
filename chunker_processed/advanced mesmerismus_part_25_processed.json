  "content": "There is a relationship between hermeticism, magnetism and quantum physics Schopenauer is in fact the key because he highly influenced the group of scientists that was at the basis of the \"quantum paradygm\" exercise =========================================================== TRUE AND DERIVATIVE SYMBOLISM The symbols as the vertical, the circle, are primitive and archetipal symbols Jung had called them \"archetypes\" But there is a \"derivate somnambulism\" that is based on the original symbol that can take MEANINGS from experiences an example is the symbol of the cross. It is an archetype, but in the christian Religion it takes further meaning Another exemple are the symbol of the MOTHER and the FATHER They are archetypes, but they get psychologically coloured. We have the true symbol, but education can \"CHARGE\" in some way the symbol. Even our hands can express symbolism. Pointing hand - directive and indicative Open hand - receiving and harmonizing Small distant touch - in some way we stay \"detached\" Archetyply, the Pointing hand many types is related to the father/male figure, the receiveing hand to the mother/female figure The psychology of our relationships with these figures will give \"colour\" to the original archetypical symbolism (Benemeglio). It means the person will search or refuse some kind of touches Furter traumatism can lead the person in not wanting any touch. We must always work experimentally. We have three styles of hypnotherapy and touch Directive Mother Detached These three types are also in Virginia Satir that observed the existence of three types.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, symbolism and touch play important roles in hypnotherapy, and understanding a client's preferences can lead to more successful results. The mirror exercise can help us identify and break free from our identified behaviors, and the use of the enneagram can help us understand different personality types. Clairvoyance can increase our sensitivity and improve Indian Self Hypnosis, which can help us to realize our desires in the universe. By combining these techniques, we can create a powerful and effective approach to hypnotherapy."
