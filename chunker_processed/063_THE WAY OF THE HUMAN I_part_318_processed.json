  "title": "What is Trance-ference and how does it affect our relationship with our humanity and the underlying unity?",
  "first_phrase": "In this special section of \"The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness\", the focus is on exploring the trance of trance-ference/counter trance-ference that is one of the major pitfalls in experiencing and discovering our human nature. This part begins by giving an illustration of the most profound levels of trances that prevent us from experiencing our humanity. The focus is on how we distort our perceptions of ourselves, the world, and our present-time relationships, and in the process lose our human nature. The text explains how losing awareness of the present-time body is the degree to which we trance-out and consequently lose our humanness. This concept is explained in order to build the context and provide a clear meaning to the last 200 tokens of the text.",
  "content": "This has been done to emphasize that, in order to unknowingly imagine, create and treat someone as your mother or father, or unknowingly imagine and treat The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness another like you are their mother or father and they are your child, or to be a child and treat another as your parent, you must go into an age regressed trance. Trance-ference should not be seen in the classic sense of an analyst analyzing a patient lying on a couch. In fact, let us put ourselves on the couch so we can see how we distort our perceptions of ourselves, the world, and our present-time relationships, and in the process lose our human nature. We lose our human nature when we lose the awareness of our present-time body, and the degree to which we lose awareness of our present-time body is the degree to which we trance-out and consequently lose our humanness. It is not that people \"leave their body,\" but rather they lose awareness of their present-time body or leave their awareness of their present-time body, and with that they lose their humanity. We must understand that our body is necessary to have a relationship to our humanity and the underlying unity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, being aware of our present-time body is crucial in maintaining our humanity and connection to the underlying unity. Trance-ference can distort our perceptions and lead us to treat others as significant others from our past, but we can regain our awareness by acknowledging our body and recognizing the oneness of all substances. Maintain presence in the present and see the world through new eyes."
