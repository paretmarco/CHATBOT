  "title": "\"How can resting the mind lead to creative thinking and genial thoughts?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, the importance of mental rest and relaxation is emphasized as key to unlocking the creativity necessary for genial thinking. The author argues that mental void is not idleness, but rather a necessary part of the cognitive process. The text encourages readers to learn how to create mental vacuum and use techniques like psycho-physical relaxation and the technique of the light. By providing a space for rest and alternate periods of effort, the mind operates more efficiently and creatively. This section complements the previous one, which highlights the importance of mindful work and rest, explaining that the alternating nature of these processes is the key to creative work.",
  "content": "You must learn how to create some vacuum inside your spirit by “sweeping up” all thoughts, irritants, and plans. Chances to relax one’s spirit spontaneously arise every day, and they might even be deliberately set up. When you go to your office or come back from it, as you are waiting for a person, during a meal, in the course of work itself, there are always opportunities to relax. Psycho-physical relaxation and the technique of the light are powerful tools in this connection. The body and the mind that work incessantly cannot but work badly. The mind, exactly like a race horse, must be trained to carry out gradually more strenuous efforts, subject to the proviso that such efforts should be interspersed by periods of complete rest. That way, the brain will increase its performance step by step, precisely as the horse learns to progressively increase its speed. The following point thus ensues: We must reflect with all our energies on the issues which are in need of attention, but we must also fully and unconditionally rest as soon as our vision begins to get blurred. This alternation of effort and relaxation represents the secret behind creative work.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning to create a vacuum within your mind by practicing psycho-physical relaxation techniques and alternating between periods of effort and rest is crucial for enhancing mental prowess. By banishing extraneous thoughts and concentrating on issues, you can activate your mind's capacity for creative thinking while also ensuring you rest fully and unconditionally at the right time. Remember, opportunities for relaxation exist everywhere, and it's up to you to seize them to unlock your utmost potential."
