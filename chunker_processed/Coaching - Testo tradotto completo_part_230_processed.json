  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author emphasizes the importance of balance and proportion in defining the coordinates of various factors one needs to pay attention to while drawing up a life plan. The last part of the text delves deeper into the concept of harmonious balance with the environment and the role of minor plans in achieving specific objectives. The author highlights the significance of adapting to the environment while also transforming it to some extent. The ability to develop originality and not be absorbed by the environment is crucial to success. The author stresses the importance of minor plans in defining the single stages and objectives that help achieve the broader ideals defined in the life plan.",
  "content": "Each one of us, in addition to the large social element in which he spends his life, has a narrower environment which is more specifically his. Whoever ends up soaked up by it entirely, without endeavouring to move from the current state to a higher one, is a human being who is laid to ruins. The environment is the raw matter we need to work on. Many people, madly possessed by grand ideals which are theoretically valid and yet incapable of practical implementation, live in the clouds and despise the environment, in so doing failing to remember that the art of exploiting the environment for the sake of our purposes is utterly indispensable to success. One cannot soar high without a supporting basis. The minor plans We should bear in mind that the definition of the single stages is not a task which the life plan carries out, as the general life plan only determines the quality and quantity of the actions which need to be embarked upon.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it's important to have grand ideals and a general life plan, it's equally important to develop minor plans with specific objectives that are practical and attainable. These plans should be based on our age, health, means, and circumstances, and should be adjusted over time to ensure progress towards our overall goals. By working on the raw matter of our environment and using it to support our aspirations, we can avoid being laid to ruins and instead soar high towards success."
