  "title": "How does ancient knowledge and modern science view the concept of time and its effects on human consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the concept of transcending time and how it relates to modern scientific research. The author mentions various historical and philosophical figures, such as Dante and Pythagoras, highlighting their views on time. The author then goes on to discuss the modern view of time in physics, which is no longer linear and limited. The author notes that the experience and perception of time can differ from person to person, and some individuals may have experienced a different sense of time. Finally, the author encourages readers to experiment with their perception of time by reliving past moments and playing with the concept.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, symbols hold a deep and multi-layered meaning that goes beyond words and language. They tap into our higher consciousness and connect us to a reality that is both physical and spiritual. By understanding and working with symbols, we open ourselves up to a new level of awareness and transformation. So let us embrace the power of symbols and let them guide us on our journey of self-discovery and growth."
