  "title": "How Did the Industrial Revolution and Technology Dehumanize People and Change Psychology's Focus?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored how technology and the industrial revolution have dehumanized people, shifting the focus of philosophy from \"Who Am I?\" to psychology's \"How can I survive, cope and handle today's problems and conflicts?\". As we delve into the last part of the text, we discover how this shift affected psychology, turning it into an industry. The author, who embarked on a spiritual journey in the late 1960s, witnessed how psychology still held a shred of light in people's search for themselves. However, upon returning from India in 1982, the field had become an industry. This shift in psychology raises the question of how we can cope with and solve the dilemmas of life when the industry itself has lost its way.",
  "content": "The industrial revolution made technology our god and ownership of possessions our demi-god. Even in modern society the idea of discovering WHO YOU ARE is now confused with what you do or have. The sickness of our society was the giving-up of our connection to humanity for technological advances. This was deemed progress and healthy. And the individual that could not fit in or cope was unhealthy. It could be said that people no longer had the time or energy to explore the question of \"Who Am IT' The assembly line increased productivity and \"progress\" but the price was high. Stress escalated and anxiety rose to new heights as we were taken out of our natural environment and placed in an industrial complex—in a sense, an anti-human situation. It could be said that, as technology and industry grew and became dehumanized, so did psychology as we presently know it. In fact, we can easily see the correlation. When I embarked on \"my\" journey in the late 1960s, psychology still had a shred of light—people in search of themselves. But when \"I\" returned from India in 1982 the field had become an industry.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the industrial revolution brought technological advancements at a steep cost that resulted in the dehumanization of society and the loss of our connection to our humanity. Quantum Psychology emerged to address the question of \"Who Am I?\" and to bring us back to the roots of psychology, incorporating physics and Eastern and Middle-Eastern religions as its cornerstones. Let us consider delving deep inside ourselves to discover our true essence amidst this technological era."
