  "content": "The first step which is required in order to bring about this man is to eliminate the encumbering burdens, the useless thoughts and the negative emotions, and to centralize one’s own self. Avoiding dispersions Whoever defeats his own self becomes invincible (Lao Tse) Thought is a force. Thoughts are things. Energy follows in the footsteps of thought. Think of success and you will get success; think of misery and you will reap misery. Steering the course of your thought is the basis for steering the course of your affairs. The practice which consists in elimination and in acquiring mastery over the mental and emotional dimensions, leads us to empty the ground of all useless sources of agitation and to plug — so to speak — the gaps from which a large part of a person’s nervous energy dissipates away. This concept is closely connected with the concept of attention, inasmuch as being voluntarily alert means no more than being voluntarily neglectful of useless or less useful urges 9. Its meaning is to voluntarily opt for one of many psychological facts which might be simultaneously actualized in one’s consciousness. STAY CONSCIOUS AND TARGET THE ACTION. Do not do - say - think – anything which is useless.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve success and mastery over one's emotions, it is crucial to eliminate useless thoughts and negative emotions, and to focus the mind on important and relevant actions. By becoming conscious of our actions and avoiding useless distractions, we can learn to steer the course of our affairs and achieve invincibility over our own selves, as advocated by Lao Tse. Remember that thoughts are things and energy follows them, so choose your thoughts and focus your attention wisely."
