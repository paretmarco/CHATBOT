  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of questioning our self-identified thoughts, as taught by Nisargadatta Maharaj. The author shares a personal experience of questioning a limiting belief and how it dissolved. Meher Baba's concept of the \"I\" being like an iceberg is mentioned to illustrate how a large part of our beliefs and assumptions can be outside of conscious awareness. The importance of noticing and discarding these limiting beliefs is emphasized. The text ends with practical advice for readers to apply this concept in their lives.",
  "content": "\"I\" looked at it and \"I\" asked, \"Who is this I?\" and it disappeared. The truth was that I had experienced my whole life as an uphill battle all the way, which is what my mother had always told me. This assumption about 89 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness life had been outside of my awareness and I had never questioned it. But once I questioned this thought—it disappeared. I would say that one of the major things Nisargadatta Maharaj has taught \"me\" is how to enquire. Meher Baba once described the ego—or the \"I\"—as being like an iceberg. All you can see is 10% of the iceberg and the other 90% is under water (outside of \"your\" awareness) so you can't see it. As you begin to enquire what is underneath, the water starts to come up. You don't have to do anything with it, just notice that it's there, how it constricts your internal subjective reality and impacts your life—then \"discard it.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of self-enquiry can lead to a profound shift in your awareness and transform your life. By questioning your assumptions and discarding negative thoughts that limit your potential, you can access the 90% of yourself that lies hidden beneath the surface and create a reality that aligns with your true nature. So go forth and enquire, dear reader, for the truth will set you free."
