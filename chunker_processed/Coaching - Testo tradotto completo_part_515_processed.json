  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author talks about the essential elements a trader should focus on to build a balanced trading system for all market directions. The first part of the text discusses the concept of quantum register and its relevance to a balanced mind. In the last 200 tokens, the author identifies four passages a trader goes through to attain a conscious level of trading ability. This includes being \"unconsciously incompetent,\" which is the state of an inexperienced trader who lacks awareness of their shortcomings. The author emphasizes the importance of a balanced mindset and a good trading system for all market directions to become a successful trader.",
  "content": "It is only when I have managed to secure for myself a good trading system for every type of direction that I can grasp, through experience matured over time, the signals which rise to view with regard to each separate type of strategy. All these elements are first organized at a conscious level, whereafter they become unconscious. This learning process is often described as follows: In order to attain this level, four passages should be identified in a trader’s career: 1. At first, the trader is “unconsciously incompetent”. What that entails, in essence, is the state possessed by the starter: The “inexperienced trader”. He lacks consciousness of the fact that he might better his trading ability, and in fact does not even view that as possible. What is even worse is when such starter possibly even sees himself as a good trader, allows himself to become inebriated by the successes he scores, and in so doing limits his critical capacity and eventually loses sizeable amounts of money. 2.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, mastering the art of trading requires time and effort. It is a gradual process that involves moving from the state of being unconsciously incompetent to consciously competent. By analyzing the market, studying different situations and reasoning independently, traders can elevate their knowledge and proficiency, which ultimately leads to success. It is essential to avoid blind trust in automatic trading systems and guru recommendations while constantly working towards improving one's trading system for all types of direction."
