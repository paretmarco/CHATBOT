  "title": "\"What is the NOT-I-I in Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to the observer-observed dyad?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the concept of NOT-I-I as Pure Awareness was explained. Now, the author delves into the relationship between the observer and the observed. The observer, which is the ego observing itself, is actually a part of the structure it is observing, and has to be gone beyond. The Quantum work suggests that multiple observers arise and subside with each experience, with each experience containing a different observer. The text also explores the three illusions about the observer that must be gone beyond. Quantum Psychology believes that Gurdjieff's objective consciousness is a quality of ESSENCE, which is observation with no object.",
  "content": "There are an infinite number of observers which arise and subside with each experience, each experience containing a different observer. THE ILLUSIONS OF THE OBSERVER To explain further, there are three belief structures or illusions about the observer, or that the observer has about itself: I) it 'Quantum Psychology actually feels that Gurdjieff's objective consciousness is a quality of ESSENCE, i.e., observation with no object. 40 Chapter 11 observes and is separate from what it is looking at (not true); 2) it imagines that it creates what it's looking at (which it does not); 3) it imagines it came before or existed before that which it is observing (which it does not). These are underlying structures contained within the observer which must be gone beyond. As long as the observer is there, the False Core-False Self will be there because it too is part of this holographic unit. This is why Quantum Psychology writes it using hyphens: observer-False Core-False Self, as one unit. Trying to separate the observer fronythe False Core would be like trying to separate the smell of a rose from the rose.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to go beyond the False Core-False Self, the observer must be dismantled, as it is part of the system and observes. To do so, it's important to recognize and go beyond the three illusions about the observer: that it observes and is separate from what it's looking at, that it creates what it's looking at, and that it existed before what it is observing. Additionally, it's crucial to be mindful of the judgment and evaluation placed upon our experiences by the observer. By understanding and working with these concepts, individuals can take steps towards dismantling the observer and ultimately accessing a deeper understanding of the Self."
