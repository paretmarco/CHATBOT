  "title": "Why is \"body-work\" alone not enough in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, we learned that the organizing principle of our experience is what we call an interpretation, and thoughts and beliefs are intermediaries between non-verbal experiences and the external world. In this last part, the focus is on whether body-work or psychotherapy alone is sufficient for addressing psychological issues. Quantum Psychology principle states that the problem must be met at the level of the problem. The interconnection between body and mind is illustrated with an example of how the change in breathing and posture is necessary to heal a phobia. Therefore, neither psychological nor body-work alone is sufficient to discover who you are as a person.",
  "content": "In Quantum Physics we are dealing with probabilities; it is possible for a chair to float up into the sky—but what is the probability of that occuring To appreciate this, let us suppose someone has a phobia or low self-esteem. Can Rolfing or Feldenkrais handle the phobia by itself? The probability is low. If someone has low self-esteem, can Feldenkrais or Rolfing handle this psychological issue by itself? The probability is low. To illustrate the interconnection of body—►mind, obviously if you have a phobia, there must be a change in your breathing pattern and the way your body is standing (posture) in order to heal the phobia (or bad self-esteem, etc.). Maybe your feet lose their connection to the ground and you're not properly supported when you're feeling phobic. This interconnection must be appreciated and understood so that the body, mind and spirit are seen as the same and equal. Therefore, not only is \"psychological\" work alone not enough, but \"body-work\" or somatic re-education alone is not enough either. Neither is \"spiritual\" work alone enough to discover WHO YOU ARE. Why not?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to understand that addressing psychological, physical, and spiritual issues require a holistic approach. Each dimension of our being is interconnected, and to achieve true healing and self-discovery, we must address all aspects of ourselves. Whether it's overcoming a phobia, dealing with low self-esteem or healing from trauma, a combination of psychological work, body-work, and spiritual practices can drastically improve the likelihood of success."
