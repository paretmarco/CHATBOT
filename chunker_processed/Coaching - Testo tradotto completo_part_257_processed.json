  "title": "How does pleasure behave over time and how can we sustain it?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the concept of pleasure and its relationship with novelty are analyzed. The author explains that pleasure is a physiological response experienced by people due to a stimulus, but if that stimulus is repeated, the organism may become insensitive, and the pleasure may fade away. The author cites Gossen's law, which states that the intensity and duration of pleasure decrease with its repetition. In the last 200 tokens, the author exemplifies this concept in the context of theater, highlighting the difference between attending a show once a month and being a subscriber to several shows. The subscriber may yawn despite the novelty of the performances, as pleasure fades with routine.",
  "content": "Gossen, who has studied the constituent elements of hedonometry, to wit, the laws to which prolonged or reiterated pleasures are subject, lays down the following rule as the essential general norm: «Any pleasure, through its iteration, has a lower initial intensity and a shorter duration than the first experiencing of it. Its intensity and time span decrease at a velocity which is commensurate with the increasingly rapid pace at which the repetitions thereof take place». The abovementioned law, after all, is merely one application of the more general law on repetition, which is a factor that enfeebles and discolours feeling. A pleasure, therefore, is such especially by virtue of its novelty. To put it in a condensed form, pleasure behaves in the same way as time does. Accordingly, it gets swallowed by routine and appears to vanish away after a while. The person who frequents theatre once a month is spontaneously inclined to think that the subscribers taste a pleasure comparable with his which is further multiplied by the number of shows they are specifically allowed to attend by their subscriptions. The truth, instead, is that the subscriber ... yawns!",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the fleeting nature of pleasure dictates that novelty is critical to its sustenance. The more an experience is repeated, the less intense and shorter it becomes, resulting in a decrease in overall satisfaction. Keeping things fresh and novel is the key to prolonging pleasure and creating a more fulfilling life."
