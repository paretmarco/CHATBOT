  "title": "\"How can one plan for lasting pleasure in life despite being an eclectic person?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the process of setting up a personal plan by taking into account both external and personal considerations. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of having a program of pleasures to underpin this plan. The text explores different types of pleasures, from daily gratification to those that occur only once in a lifetime. To achieve ongoing pleasure, one must work towards fulfilling the pleasures bit by bit on a steady basis. The author raises the question of whether true ongoing pleasure exists and how one can attain it.",
  "content": "It is possible to find daily gratification for several such pleasures. This is an aspect we will need to pay utmost regard to at the stage of devising our plan. As for other pleasures within the said broad list, they might only be experienced on rare occasions, as is the case, for example, of a long trip, the purchase of a particular item, the triumphant reception of an intellectual or artistic work of hours, or a sentimental conquest. Yet a third group of pleasures to be taken into general consideration cannot but be tasted once in a lifetime or extremely seldom. As this latter category of pleasures will be in need of either a short-term or a long-term gestation, if we are truly keen to seep their flavour, we will be required to work on them bit by bit on a steady quotidian basis, so as to set out on a course towards their fulfilment. Pleasure, too, is something which ought to be planned. How does one, however, reach true pleasure and pleasure which occurs on an ongoing basis? First of all, does it actually exist?",
  "last_phrase": "To truly experience pleasure on an ongoing basis, it is essential to work towards fulfilling long-term or once-in-a-lifetime pleasures bit by bit, on a steady daily basis. By approaching our pleasures with the right mental attitude, and avoiding becoming desensitized to them, we can find lasting gratification in the things that truly matter. So go ahead, plan your pleasures, savor them fully, and continue to find daily fulfillment in life's simple pleasures."
