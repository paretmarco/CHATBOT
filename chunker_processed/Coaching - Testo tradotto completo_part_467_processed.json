  "title": "\"What is the road to financial wellbeing and the role of fantasy in trading?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses how having an objective can serve as a limit in avoiding the possibility of surrendering to a need. It also explores how needs that we develop in life and in trading can render us vulnerable as we become dependent on them. The text highlights that in trading, what matters is not to always be right but to learn from mistakes and understand why we are engaging in the financial markets. Ultimately, the road to financial well-being does not solely rely on having an absolute focus on money, but also having a purpose for it.",
  "content": "Being in need of earning, of money, of predicting the direction the market is going to take, of closing each and every deal with a gain, of perceiving ourselves to be exceptionally good every time one carries out a successful operation â€¦ All these needs might prove to be destructive! In trading, what matters is not to be in the right in every situation. Sooner or later, in fact, mistakes might be committed, and yet all of that should help teach us the purpose for which we have resolved on working in the financial markets, along with teaching us the lesson that one can learn from his errors. We can notice that, paradoxically, the road to financial wellbeing does not wind its way through having an absolute focus on money itself. A bicycle rider who restricted his whole attention solely to the act of pedalling would not be a good cyclist, and, in addition, he would soon feel tired. In order for him to win, he must also think about why he is pedalling, and where he wants to go. In the same way, money is but a means to the end of living better.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, it's crucial to understand that success in trading doesn't solely depend on money, but also on defining the purpose of earning. Placing excessive focus on money can be destructive, whereas having an ecological objective can lead to more tangible fulfillment. So, think beyond just money and set a goal that motivates you to earn and live better. Remember, learning from mistakes is essential and can help you grow as a trader."
