  "title": "\"How can one cultivate the willpower and neural strength necessary to achieve their goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the author discusses the importance of willpower and having a specific purpose in achieving success. They explain that those who never lose sight of their goals and are firmly entrenched in their choices and thoughts are the ones who achieve success. The author also emphasizes that willpower is only worth its name if it is outwardly actualized in a single direction and is conjoined to our nervous force, or vital force. The vital force is linked to man’s naturalness and exteriorized will to live, and is compared to electrical force that sets a machine in motion.",
  "content": "This will, however, is in actual fact rather than an abstract faculty, contrary to what some people might imagine. Will is only worth its name if it is outwardly actualized in a single direction. In order to kick-start one’s will, therefore, it is necessary to will something, to have a specific purpose. The inherent loftiness of a will — as we shall see here under — is precisely the basis from which its first igniting motion and its effectiveness descend. Objective ? Will (and only at a later stage Will ? Objective) Vitality: The nervous or neuric force Lastly, in order for the will to be fully actualized and attain its purpose, it is an indispensable requirement that it should be conjoined to our nervous force, to that human potential which is also termed “neuric force” or “vital force”. This is a primary force that is linked to man’s naturalness, one which is stirred into motion as soon as man is born. It consists in an exteriorized will to live. It might be compared to the electrical force which is capable of setting a machine in motion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the effectiveness of our will is dependent on its practical application towards a specific goal. However, to fully actualize our will, we must connect it to our nervous force, or neuric strength, which is the basis of our vitality. By engaging in specific exercises, we can retrieve and strengthen our neuric force, and fully attain our objectives."
