  "title": "How do trances contribute to and obstruct problem-solving in therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explored the idea that no problem can exist without a trance, and that transcending a problem means ending the trance causing it. In this final section, the author gives examples of how trances can prevent people from being present and how they can act as glue for problems. The author makes a case for intentionally creating trances to better understand them and gain control over them, with examples such as a client who disconnected to maintain their obesity symptom. The author also touches on how disconnection occurs in those with physical pain such as migraines.",
  "content": "I PRESCRIBE THE CREATION OF THE TRANCE THAT CLI- ENTS ARE ALREADY CREATING. If someone has a film over her eyes, she is watching a movie inside which prevents her from experiencing now. Trances act like glue for problems. Signals, that a trance may be occurring in yourself, are holding your breath or tightening your muscles. An example is a client who weighed 300 pounds. I identified an obesity problem (see how brilliant I am). In order for him to maintain his symptom, he disconnected. I suggested he go \"over there,\" and his body froze hard (Sensory Distortion, Chapter 13). I suggested he make it get even harder to give him control over his trance. All of a sudden, he looked at me and said I was a \"big cloud\" to him. He could barely see me. This \"not seeing\" was a blocking- out trance, ( See Chapter 8). Disconnection occurs in people with migraine headaches or other types of physical pain. They have isolated specific physical pain to individual parts of their body. In order for a problem to be a problem, the headache must be disconnected from the whole body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, identifying and disconnecting from harmful trances can lead to significant improvements in mental and physical health. By recognizing signals such as holding one's breath or tightening muscles, individuals can take control of their trance state. Complimentary trances, particularly deep disconnection, can also be effective in diluting the \"glue\" that holds problem structures together. Overall, understanding and managing trances can contribute to greater well-being and personal growth."
