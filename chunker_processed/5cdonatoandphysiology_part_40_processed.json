  "title": "\"How do Peripheral Movements and Binocular Functions Affect Our Perception and Attention?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the relationship between our conscious and subconscious minds, and how the two components of our visual system, focal vision and ambient vision, affect our perception of reality. We learn that peripheral vision is responsible for orienting us in our environment, and that focal vision is used for object recognition and conscious thought. Additionally, we investigate binocular functions, like convergence and accommodation, which help us merge the visual fields of both eyes. This understanding can lead us to explore exciting possibilities for altering our perception of reality beyond three dimensions.",
  "content": "Focal vision is not primarily involved with orienting oneself in the environment, but can be used to acquire visual information about orientation. Ambient Vision. Ambient vision is often referred to as peripheral vision. It is a subconscious function independent of focal vision whose primary role is to orient an individual in the environment. For example, one can fully occupy focal vision by reading (a conscious action), while simultaneously obtaining sufficient orientation cues with peripheral vision to walk (a subconscious function). The same can happen when flying an aircraft and performing a task such as interpreting radar contact information on a HUD. Focal vision is used to consciously decipher task-oriented information while peripheral information is subconsciously used to maintain spatial orientation.\" GOING BEYOND THREE DIMENSIONAL REALITY Altering binocular function Binocular functions refer to the ability of the eyes to coordinate their activity so that we can merge the visual fields of both eyes into one distinct image. The most commonly observed aspects of binocular functions include convergence (the ability of the two eyes to team and focus on the same object), and accommodations (the ability of the eyes to shift their focus from near point to far point or vice versa).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding the different aspects of vision such as focal and ambient vision, binocular function, and the role of peripheral movements, we can go beyond the three-dimensional reality and enhance our visual perception. Experimenting with hand movements in our peripheral field and alternating between our eyes can awaken new visual insights and improve our balance and spatial orientation."
