  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we talked about the importance of self-control and freeing the basic energy. Now, we'll discuss how wasteful thoughts and actions can consume our energy and hinder our success. It's not uncommon to see people who work tirelessly, but still struggle to make ends meet. On the other hand, some people achieve their goals with seemingly minimal effort. We must learn to eliminate useless actions, thoughts, and words that fill our lives and take away precious time. By doing less, we can do more. The key is to master self-control and focus on target actions. In this final section, we'll explore how thoughts and emotions can rob us of our energy, and how we can overcome these obstacles to achieve success.",
  "content": "learning how to eliminate all the wasteful slag, the useless actions, thoughts and words, which fill up our life and wrest time from us. We must first know how to be ourselves, simply ourselves, and only thereafter we should target an action. The initial work is the one that is carried out on the mental aspect: Every useless thought steals away some vital force, mental clarity and time. We should likewise view unnecessary repeated thoughts as being divested of any usefulness: How many times should we keep on formulating a particular resolution in our minds? For the successful person, it is enough if he says to himself, ‘Do!’ just once, as he then acts upon that self-injunction. As for the person who cannot produce results, he tells himself a thousand times that he should be doing something, without ever getting to do it at all. If you become conscious of that, you will discover that a large part of what you used to do was of no use whatsoever, and that it merely consumed some of your energy. It is not only thoughts which rob us of energy. Emotions, too, rob us our time and freeze it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning to eliminate wasteful thoughts and actions is crucial to reclaiming our time and vital energy. By mastering our minds, we can redirect our energy towards achieving our goals while still being present for new opportunities. Embracing this new mindset will lead to a more fulfilling life and stronger relationships with others, ultimately allowing us to fulfill our personal ideals."
