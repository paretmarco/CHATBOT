  "first_phrase": "The last part of the text is focused on exercises to develop what is called the \"Fascinative Force\", which is the ability to capture and maintain the attention of others through gaze and body language. The text mentions different exercises to improve one's attention and gaze, which are essential for leading oneself before being able to lead others. The text highlights the importance of breathing and explains how to perform a fundamental exercise. It also describes characteristics of a magnetic person and suggests exercises to develop ocular power. Finally, the text provides an exercise to improve reading without blinking.",
  "content": "When it comes to blink, stop. You have to because when you blink the mind changes. When you are interested in something, eyelids do not flinch. Try to Milton Erickson \"Healing in Hypnosis\" Erickson, Rossi \"Hypnotic realities\" Patanjaliâ€™s fourth book of aphorisms, the base text for the Yoga study, which outlines global philosophy, begins with a series of sentences related to \"concentration on one point\". Ormond Mc Gill \"Hypnotism and Mysticism of India\" The fact that mind changes when blinking has been proved and tested in many ways: see for example the article \"Eyes blinking reaction and its use in hypnosis\" Anatoly Tkachev, M.A. and Inga Topeshko, M.A. This experiment shows how the blink gradually increase the time during which you can remain without blinking: you can start with a few tens of seconds and then gradually increase up to a minute, then start to add a minute at a time until you reach a quarter of an hour. Always rest a bit your eyes keeping them closed after doing this exercise. In theory, you could keep them closed for the same period and work, at that time, on visualization, trying to review what you have just observed. Do not ever rub them with your hands, not to irritate them. This exercise is very helpful, one of the best for those who want to learn how to hypnotize quickly and efficiently. Exercise 5 Make a great effort to read a page of a book every day without ever close your eyes.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing the exercises presented here, you can improve your hypnotic abilities and increase your fascinative force. From learning to concentrate on one point to creating a fixed point within yourself, each exercise has its own unique benefits. Remember to start slow and gradually build up the duration of each exercise, and always be present in the moment. With practice, you can develop a stronger presence and enhance your ability to fascinate and influence others."
