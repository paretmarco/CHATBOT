  "content": "When it comes to blink, stop. You have to because when you blink the mind changes. When you are interested in something, eyelids do not flinch. Try to Milton Erickson \"Healing in Hypnosis\" Erickson, Rossi \"Hypnotic realities\" Patanjaliâ€™s fourth book of aphorisms, the base text for the Yoga study, which outlines global philosophy, begins with a series of sentences related to \"concentration on one point\". Ormond Mc Gill \"Hypnotism and Mysticism of India\" The fact that mind changes when blinking has been proved and tested in many ways: see for example the article \"Eyes blinking reaction and its use in hypnosis\" Anatoly Tkachev, M.A. and Inga Topeshko, M.A. This experiment shows how the blink gradually increase the time during which you can remain without blinking: you can start with a few tens of seconds and then gradually increase up to a minute, then start to add a minute at a time until you reach a quarter of an hour. Always rest a bit your eyes keeping them closed after doing this exercise. In theory, you could keep them closed for the same period and work, at that time, on visualization, trying to review what you have just observed. Do not ever rub them with your hands, not to irritate them. This exercise is very helpful, one of the best for those who want to learn how to hypnotize quickly and efficiently. Exercise 5 Make a great effort to read a page of a book every day without ever close your eyes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises for improving concentration and focus through the control of gaze and body consciousness can be very beneficial for anyone interested in developing their hypnotic or fascinative abilities. They can be easily incorporated into daily activities and can gradually increase in duration and difficulty as mastery is achieved. With practice, one can achieve greater presence and reintegration, leading to a stronger fascinative force and increased ability to impose their will on others. Overall, these exercises provide a practical and effective way to improve one's mental discipline and focus."
