  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus remains on the concept of presence and its importance in strengthening one's fascinative force. The author provides various exercises that help individuals develop this gift, including fixing a gaze on a person to make them feel impelled to seek attention, concentrated blinking exercises, and attention and gaze development exercises. The author emphasizes the need to be present and attentive to oneself before leading others. Additionally, the text highlights the significance of muscle tension, creating energy, and maintaining attention to achieve inner harmony.",
  "content": "\"While the Id begins to consider itself, they mildly fall, one by one, all the barriers that previously \"being unaware of itself \", prevented it to admire the perfect inner harmony, until He can see itself in its fullness”. If we want to fascinate we must learn to be outside of our mental thoughts and conceptualizations of the average person. Exercise 7 Create a fixed point. Try to pay attention mentally to the exact feeling in your right hand, then the left, then right foot, then left. Do the same with knees, elbows, ears, fingers, etc. During the day, you can extend the exercise, remaining always conscious of a part of yourself. Note. -To grasp the exact sensation, the student has to focus his thought on the point indicated, without letting the mind wander. The properly performed concentration, will give a sensation that the student will easily be able to recognize; sometimes is a stinging, other times a light impact or the impression that blood is heading to the designated point. You can also put a finger on any point, and insistently focus the thought on the touched point. Exercise 62 Light – in \"The mirrors\" – Ignis – p. 262 Is the same action of attention, but in motion. As you walk, talk, keep a fixed reference point in yourself. Better a peripheral point. Take consciousness for example of your hand, your foot. This exercise will help to separate gradually the perception of the body from your emotional and to acquire greater consciousness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises aim to increase mindfulness and sensory awareness, leading to a stronger connection between mind and body. By practicing exercises such as creating a fixed point, focusing on touch, and integrating sub-sensorial responses, individuals can hone their ability to be present and centered. Through consistent practice, one can reap the benefits of greater consciousness, reduced tension, and heightened sensitivity. So, take the time to focus on your body and surroundings, and watch as your perception of reality expands."
