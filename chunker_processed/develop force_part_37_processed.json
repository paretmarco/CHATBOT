  "title": "\"How to Develop Presence and Fascination according to Gurdjieff and Ancient Alchemists?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the focus remains on the concept of presence, which brings together the teachings of Gurdjieff, ancient alchemists, wise Taoists, practitioners of Yoga, and esoteric traditions from around the world. The key to developing presence is to be aware of oneself and to live in the present moment. The text provides practical exercises such as fascination and attention to help achieve this state of being. By practicing these exercises, one can develop a powerful gaze, maintain attention, and separate body perception from emotions.",
  "content": "\"While the Id begins to consider itself, they mildly fall, one by one, all the barriers that previously \"being unaware of itself \", prevented it to admire the perfect inner harmony, until He can see itself in its fullness”. If we want to fascinate we must learn to be outside of our mental thoughts and conceptualizations of the average person. Exercise 7 Create a fixed point. Try to pay attention mentally to the exact feeling in your right hand, then the left, then right foot, then left. Do the same with knees, elbows, ears, fingers, etc. During the day, you can extend the exercise, remaining always conscious of a part of yourself. Note. -To grasp the exact sensation, the student has to focus his thought on the point indicated, without letting the mind wander. The properly performed concentration, will give a sensation that the student will easily be able to recognize; sometimes is a stinging, other times a light impact or the impression that blood is heading to the designated point. You can also put a finger on any point, and insistently focus the thought on the touched point. Exercise 62 Light – in \"The mirrors\" – Ignis – p. 262 Is the same action of attention, but in motion. As you walk, talk, keep a fixed reference point in yourself. Better a peripheral point. Take consciousness for example of your hand, your foot. This exercise will help to separate gradually the perception of the body from your emotional and to acquire greater consciousness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises aim to increase one's consciousness and sensitivity by focusing and being present in our own bodies and surroundings. By practicing these exercises consistently, we can learn to separate ourselves from our mental thoughts and conceptualizations, and acquire greater awareness of our inner and outer worlds. From paying attention to individual body parts to experiencing the sensation of touch and even seeing one's aura, these exercises can be challenging but rewarding in helping us reach our highest potential. Remember to approach each exercise with patience and focus, and don't push yourself beyond your limits."
