  "first_phrase": "This text is about a young trader who is searching for a way to learn how to build and use a trading system automatically. Although it seemed impossible to him, he found a method to build such a system but realized that it only works for a limited period. In the last 200 tokens, the trader wonders about his true motives for trading and acknowledges that money is just one resource among many. He concludes that relying only on money can be a trap, and that it's time to apply his knowledge and experience to accomplish his goals.",
  "content": "Following a period of time he had devoted to trading systems, the young trader addressed to his self the following question: “What is it that I truly desire to achieve?” A person who engages in trading does so in order to earn money, but the youngster understood that money in life was merely a resource; it might indeed happen that some people own a lot of money, and yet they do not have other resources, whereupon, so long as they manage to go through life by making use of their sole resource, everything seems to be turning out well; but as soon as the resource called “money” is of no benefit in making them reach what they desire, they might then own all the money in this world without it proving to be of any use to them whatsoever. The youngster understood that, after such a long time he had spent studying and building up experience, the time had come to make use of all of that for the sake of accomplishing his purposes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the young trader realized that money is just a resource and that true success comes from moving towards what one truly desires to accomplish. By practicing self-hypnosis, he was able to access a higher level of learning and achieve his goals. Our method of magnetic success is based on four phases, including self-hypnosis, to help you accomplish what truly matters to you."
