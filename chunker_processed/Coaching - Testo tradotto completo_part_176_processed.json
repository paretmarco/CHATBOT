  "title": "\"How can we discover our true purpose and direction in life through expanding our consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the importance of consciously deciding on one's own purpose in life, rather than simply copying external ideals. He emphasizes the need for being present, expanding consciousness, and perceiving accumulations of reality to understand one's true direction. The author also notes that every individual is unique and approaches their purpose in life differently. It is crucial to avoid being tossed around by impulses and to strive for evolution consciously.",
  "content": "The problem, however, is that such purpose is very often one he has copied from other people, be they family members or outsiders. So long as that external ideal lurks in the subconscious, it sometimes has an undesired influence on our beings. What we are learning in the context of this book, by contrast, is to go into ourselves and consciously decide, in a state of awareness, what we want to do, as opposed to letting ourselves be tossed around at will by impulses which hold sway over our persons. Men widely differ from one another in the way they approach the purpose behind their lives. There is the man who lives entertaining a vague hope, and who fails to pay attention. For most men, living has the meaning of spending the present by coping with the hardships of existence as best as possible, in the vague expectation of a better future. With this kind of approach, what is better or worse is restricted to one’s animal side, and the urge to evolve is left to the vagaries of chance, in the clutch of some hope in an ambiguous “something” which might change one’s existence.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to live a purposeful life, it is imperative to reject the external ideals that have been imposed on us, and consciously decide on our own path. As we strive to build, create, and grow, we must also seek to expand our understanding of our place in the larger universe. By doing so, we can unlock our true potential and achieve a more fulfilling existence."
