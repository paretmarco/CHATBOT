  "first_phrase": "In this excerpt from \"The Way of the Human: Beyond Quantum Psychology Chapter III,\" therapist Stephen Wolinsky engages in a therapeutic conversation with Alice about her assumptions regarding gravity and her desire to hold things together. He helps her explore the limiting beliefs she holds about herself and encourages her to externalize her constricting \"container.\" Through this process, Alice feels lighter and finds herself laughing with a renewed sense of freedom.",
  "content": "That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea you have about yourself. There's a limited amount of time I have to do something. That's an interesting idea. How do you know you want to do something? By a thought or a past feeling. ________________ Wolinsky:According to what or whom? Alice:Therapy world, society, etc., mom-dad. Wolinsky:Where in your body do you experience this con- tainer or controller? Alice:Chest. Wolinsky:Intentionally solidify the container, clamp down the container giving yourself less space. Alice:This feels terrible. Wolinsky:What does WANT mean? ________________ Now, let the container do whatever it does. How's that? Alice:I want to laugh.Alice: Therapeutic Note Next, I want to externalize the container.Wolinsky: Wolinsky:What have you done to the container? Alice:Yes, they are both related to the container. Wolinsky:How are you doing? Wolinsky:Is the \"I\" which is part of the container, believing Alice:Lighter.the container right now? Wolinsky:Where is the container now in relationship to youAlice:No body now? Wolinsky:How are you doing now?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to identify and explore our internal containers and learn how to manage them effectively. By externalizing our emotions, we can gain a new perspective and sense of control over our lives, allowing us to experience safety and comfort rather than discomfort and aloneness. Remember to take the time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings, and don't be afraid to seek help if needed."
