  "title": "How can interrupting deep trance states facilitate therapy and access untapped resources?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explains the concept of deep trance phenomena and how it can lead to anxiety attacks that seem uncontrollable. The author describes how any interruption or alteration of this trance state can facilitate the access of untapped resources in the mind. In the last 200 tokens, the author gives an example of a therapy setting where the therapist facilitates an interruption to the symptomatic trance state of an alcoholic woman. By asking her questions, the therapist helps her differentiate and understand her negative hallucinations, leading her to eventually stop excessive drinking.",
  "content": "In short, I have \"popped out\" of my identification with the Deep Trance Phenomena creating the anxiety attack, and once \"outside,\" resources become readily available. In everyday life, any appropriate stimulus can interrupt or alter the Deep Trance Phenomenon: my phone might ring, I remember an important call I need to make, I discover I am out of toilet paper and have to go to the market!

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, interrupting and altering deep trance patterns of negative hallucination and age regression can help individuals overcome their symptoms of addiction. Whether in therapy or everyday life, any appropriate stimulus can facilitate an interruption and shift in the symptomatic trance state. Combining therapy with participation in a twelve-step program can also provide additional support and awareness to aid in recovery. By interrupting the self-to-self trance of the symptom with eye contact and breathing, individuals can shift to a self-to-other trance, leading to a successful outcome."
