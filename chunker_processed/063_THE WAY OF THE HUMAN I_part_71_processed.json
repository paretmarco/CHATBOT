  "title": "What is the False Core-False Self and how can Quantum Psychology help you understand it?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the concept of False Core and False Self, which represents the \"I\" of an individual and influences their entire experience of the \"internal-external\" world. The author critiques many psycho-spiritual systems that fail to acknowledge and reinforce the False Core, leading to an obsession with \"overcoming, healing, or transforming\" it. Ultimately, the discussion aims to help readers liberate their awareness and develop multi-dimensional awareness by dismantling the False Core through inquiry.",
  "content": "Many psycho-spiritual systems describe the False Core tendencies. Unfortunately however, many forms of psychology and spirituality unknowingly re-enforce the client's False Core through the False Self's \"imagining\" it can be overcome, healed or transformed. Unfortunately these systems use the False Self to do the work or create spiritualized \"Archetypical\" stories like \"the Fall of Man\" to explain and justify this natural biological separation process. Please keep in mind that the False Core-False Self is a map, and maps are made by peopleâ€”it's not the territory (see Volume II, The Rise and Fall of the Enneagram). QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The False Core-False Self is more than just a concept you have about yourself. It represents the \"I\" you call yourself and, hence, it represents you and your entire experience of the \"internal-external\" world. Every movement of your mind is driven by the False Core. The question that really matters is, \"What is driving the movement of your psychology?\" \"What is the one concept you have that organizes everything in your life?\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, identifying and understanding the False Core-False Self in Quantum Psychology is crucial for personal growth and transformation. By tracing back all our behavior and actions to the False Core, we gain insights into our internal processes and learn to accept and sit in it, without attempting to change it."
