  "title": "Can a hypnotized person be used as an unconscious instrument of crime?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses the potential dangers of hypnotism being used as an instrument of crime. Doctor Bruardel and Doctor Charcot believe that a person under hypnosis will not act on criminal suggestions that go against their personal affections or natural instincts. The text also discusses the possibility of using date suggestion to command a subject to commit an act in the future. However, it emphasizes that a subject will resist any suggestion that goes against their will. The text concludes by stating that while the science of fascination is still in its infancy, it has the potential to be useful in various fields, such as anesthesia for surgical operations.",
  "content": "What has most disturbed the timid fearful and rebellious to all innovation is that it is possible to produce suggestion by date: that is to say, to command a subject to commit an act in the future at a given day and hour. Like the alarm of a clock which rings at a certain hour, the subject falls into a trance and executes the mandate at the moment indicated. But I repeat the most sensitive is refractory to acts that are repugnant to him. The fascinated subject feels vaguely that he is the sport of illusions, plunged in a sort of intoxication. He enjoys it as long as it flatters his taste or his inclinations, but he refrains with all his energy as soon as he feels in peril. As an intoxicated man will become sober under the influence of a strong emotion, the subject exposed to danger endeavors to regain his liberty, awakening then as from a nightmare. Like somnambulism, fascination is called upon to render striking services. The science being still in its cradle it is not possible to foresee at the present time what will be its destiny. The anesthesia provoked by fascination offers a process far preferable to chloroform for surgical operations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while mesmerism and hypnosis may have their pros and cons, the ability to produce suggestion by date and induce a suggested lethargic sleep offers great potential for medical and even philosophical applications. As with any emerging field, there may be false ideas mixed in with the truth, but history has shown that great scientific discoveries often arise from seemingly absurd theories."
