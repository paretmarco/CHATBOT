  "title": "How do Forces and Physics Dimensions interact to create archetypes and consciousness according to Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This section explores the Hindu concept of forces and elements, and how they relate to modern physics. The understanding that we are formed by forces and physics dimensions that are not separate from ourselves has not changed much over time. Physicist Michio Kaku wrote that matter is made up of the harmonies created by vibrating strings containing energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces. These vibrations create archetypes and a \"personal me\" and a \"personal you\" out of the void of undifferentiated consciousness. This concept of the \"I AM\" arising from the collective and the void is explained through the prism of string theory.",
  "content": "153-154) If we use the metaphor of a string, it can be said that the vibration and harmony of each string creates Forces and Physics Dimensions which, like the prism forming a rainbow, creates what we call archetypes and a \"personal me\" and a \"personal you\" out of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or NOTHINGNESS. Or as Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"In the beginning there was NOTHING ABSOLUTELY, the I AM appeared 87 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology (through condensation), and one day this I AM will thin-out and there will be NOTHING AGAIN.\" QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"The I AM comes from the COL- LECTIVE\" (a play or interaction of the Physics dimensions). This means that the basic I AM which precedes all we call ourselves, and even the \"you are,\" are also Archetypes or a combination of the Physics Dimensions (Rainbow) through the Super strings (Prism) and which arise out of a condensation of the NOTHINGNESS or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. As mentioned earlier, whether string theory is right or wrong is inconsequential.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology suggests that there might be an intermediate \"something\" that forms what we call \"us,\" which could be identified as Super Strings arising from the Void of Undifferentiated Consciousness. By interacting with the different Physics Dimensions, these Super Strings generate Archetypes that create the collective unconscious and personal unconscious and conscious behaviors. This understanding could help us explore and use energy, space, mass, time, gravity, electromagnetics, strong and weak forces, and more to better ourselves and our world through spiritual and psychological practices."
