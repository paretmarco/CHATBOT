  "title": "How does Gestalt therapy help uncover unexpressed resentment and guilt?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of Chapter 1, Wolinsky and Debra continue their Gestalt therapy session. Debra talks about using the False Self of stealing her mother's husband to prove her worth and avoid feeling unworthy. Wolinsky asks her to imagine having affection from any man, which prompts her to recall how even the crumbs of affection from her father made her feel worthwhile. He encourages her to make the statement, “I will just beg for the crumbs if that is what I can get,” to both her father and men in general. Debra agrees and also admits to using reflection to get the love she desires.",
  "content": "Debra:To get even with you, because you can't give me what I want, I'm going to steal your husband. It wasn't very nice. I'm feeling guilty. What did you create in response to them being affectionate and you being out of the picture? Well, me wanting some affection from one of them. I didn't care which one. I would like for you to have an image of all men out there. Look at your dad and notice how just the crumbs from your father made you feel so worthwhile. It didn't take much. Make the statement to these men that \"I will just beg for the crumbs if that is what I can get.\" I've done that too. Say to your father, \"I didn't get much, I'll beg for the crumbs.\" I didn't get much, so I will just beg for the crumbs. And to men out there, \"Since I didn't get much, I'll become your reflection just to get the crumbs.\" Since I didn't get much, I'll just reflect you to get the crumbs.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to heal and move forward, it's important to acknowledge and explore the root of our actions and behaviors. By separating our past identities and experiences from our present selves, we can gain a new perspective and understanding of who we truly are."
