  "title": "\"How does the need for survival trigger age-regression and trance-like behavior in individuals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author delves into the concept of the trance of survival as the most powerful age-regression trigger. Using the physical and psychological development of children as an example, they explain how individuals develop self-awareness and a sense of separation from the world. The author also touches on the recent US Congress election as an example of age-regression in voters who sought comfort in the familiar concept of tax breaks for the wealthy. Understanding the trance of survival is crucial in recognizing how it shapes our beliefs and actions.",
  "content": "In this case, survival needs being high, the lower middle-class voters age-regressed with the philosophy, Let's give tax breaks to the wealthy (Mom and Dad who controlled the money for them as children) and they will \"take care of us\" (give us our allowance) by creating jobs (errands). THE TRANCE OF SURVIVAL The need to survive ignites this age-regression and the collapsing of the levels. Survival is the trigger and represents the most powerful trance of all. Survival can be defined as the fight/flight mechanism which contains a survival scanning-searching-seeking and overgeneralizing device which is the physical, psychological and emotional survival of an individual. For example, let's look at the 211 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness physical body. As the physical body develops, a psychology and an individuality develop. As children move from thinking that they are merged with the mother and they are their mother (to be discussed later) in the early phases of childhood, they develop an individual self, a personality, and they begin to differentiate. They notice that they are separate from their mother, and separate from the world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the survival trance represents the most powerful form of human behavior, triggered by the need to survive. It causes individuals to regress to early developmental stages, creating dissociative observers and identities to defend against the loss of self in relationships and against unmet biological needs. Understanding this phenomenon can help us better navigate our own behaviors and provide insights into the behavior of others."
