  "title": "What are the four stages of working with mirrors to develop higher levels of consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses different techniques to reach a higher level of consciousness using mirrors. The four stages of the process are outlined, starting from observing oneself in the mirror to reaching a state where communication and visions are possible. It is emphasized that the exercises require focus and presence in the moment and a gradual increase in duration and intensity. The text also mentions the experiences that can be perceived, such as the first auras and magnetic and mental radiation. Finally, the text mentions that visions can be obtained through a passive state that is open to perception.",
  "content": "Do not believe that the above experiences could be experienced with the same rapidity with which you read ... You will easily observe something as the first auras (even something as human radiation could be visible), magnetic and mental, the latter with a particular intensity, and their growth and acting, that could be increased practicing particular exercises. VISIONS IN THE FLUIDIC LEVEL - SECOND STAGE (? ?“The waters”) At this point, visions could be possible. The operator can open himself to this new dimension and this requires a slightly controlled passive state open to perception. Communication and vision of far people can be obtained at this point. Focusing intensely the thoughts on the image of a person will soon draw in the outlines of it in the mirror, until, becoming more precise, it will show up in the way in which our thought create it, or even as it is in the moment of the experiment (that in this case we could call of far sight). By the same process it is easy to recall past events, as well as having a clear vision of the future. It is important to note that the figures mentioned do not speak, which is very obvious, but the operator has clear conscience, and it is as he could feel the vibrations of the words inside. You can easily see your body or the body of imagined people almost like a mass of a dark gray, more intense here and there, surrounded entirely by a band of slightly brighter light.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey towards heightened states of consciousness is a gradual and challenging process that requires patience, dedication, and practice. From experiencing auras and visions to lucid dreaming in a waking state and beyond the abyss, the exercises and techniques outlined in this text offer a framework for those seeking to explore the vast potential of human perception. With careful guidance and persistence, one can transcend the limitations of the ordinary self and access new dimensions of awareness, revealing the true essence of the self and the mysteries of the universe."
