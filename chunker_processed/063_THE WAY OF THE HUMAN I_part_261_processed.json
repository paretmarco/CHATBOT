  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the differences between biological and psychological fear, and how they can overlap in the human experience. Moving forward, the author introduces the concept of libido as the natural biological merging response. They argue that society has misconstrued the primal energy of libido as solely related to sexual desire. The author suggests that recognizing this natural merging energy could have profound implications for how we view relationships and the self.",
  "content": "Psychological fear, on the other hand can be the associational trance at work. For example, in the emotional dimension \"I got hit by a car when I was 5 and now 25 years later when I see a car, I go into terror.\" That is psychological overlapping, collapsing memories and associations from the thinking dimension with the emotional dimension. This occurs when a thinking image and an emotional experience are replayed through the biology. LIBIDO: THE BIOLOGICAL MERGER RESPONSE Libido is the natural biological merging response. It is the natural biological drive to merge, either physically or at an external thinking, emotional or essential level. It has been greatly misunderstood. Libido does not mean sex. If someone says their libido is down, this is interpreted as meaning that their sex drive is low. But this is not what it really means. As the natural biological drive to merger response, the primal energy of the libido is actually a natural merging energy. Society has confused this, and made libido into sex. Think what it would be like if we accepted the fact there was a natural merging energy and a natural unmerging energy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the primal energy of libido as a natural merging response, rather than solely a sexual drive, can unlock the potential for natural merging and unmerging at any level without guilt or frustration. However, personal history and trauma may inhibit one's ability to contain sensations within their body's boundaries, leading to psychological fear and associations."
