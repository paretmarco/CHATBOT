  "title": "What are the steps for a breathing exercise and how can it benefit your health and well-being?",
  "first_phrase": "In this exercise, a certain breathing technique is followed that involves exhaling as much air as one can before inhaling slowly through the nose, keeping the mouth closed. It is recommended to repeat the exercise three to four times in a row, and hold your breath for increasingly longer periods of time. After practicing this exercise for a few days, you can move on to the next one that involves lifting your arms and gradually touching the floor with your fingertips as you exhale. The exercise may cause a sensation of vertigo initially, but it is harmless and actually helps in activating inactive areas of the body. The exercise only takes a minute each morning and has far-reaching benefits. This text does not contain any relevant names or concepts.",
  "content": "Immediately thereafter, lift the arms as high above your head as it is possible, and look at your toes. Then bend down gradually, until, if at all feasible, you are able to touch the floor with your fingertips, without bending your knees in the process. Regain at that point an upright position, and let the arms fall down along your body while you exhale the air through the lungs. At the beginning, this exercise might cause you a sensation of vertigo, but it will actually cause you no inconvenience. The occurrence of such a sensation is only due to the fact that some areas of the body, especially by the region of the lungs, which had long been inactive, are now put to use. There is no exercise which is able to compel air to enter each and every particle of the lungs that can be compared to the one we have just described above. The implementation of this exercise will not take more than one minute of your time each morning, and only a few days will be enough to persuade the student of the extremely far-reaching benefits it is capable of securing.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, incorporating the simple exercise of reaching for the floor and lifting your arms each morning for only one minute can have far-reaching benefits for your mind and body. Not only does it increase the capacity of your lungs, it also fills you with a magnetic energy that cannot be obtained elsewhere, and can be used for general self-control. So why not try it out and see how it works for you?"
