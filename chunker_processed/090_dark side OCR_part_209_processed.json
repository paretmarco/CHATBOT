  "title": "How does idealization and spiritualization affect relationships and personal growth?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses three levels of trances that emerge from unresolved childhood issues. First, the child idealizes their parents to survive, then the child within the adult generalizes this to their spouse, thus avoiding new realities. Finally, the third level of trance, \"Spiritualizing,\" arises which is rooted in pre-verbal cognition and deeply involves survival. Individuals who do not complete the first two processes may unintentionally fall into spiritualizing. The author warns that spiritualizing can be difficult to spot and may hinder personal development.",
  "content": "In these two trances, the inner child ( I) defends himself from who the person truly is, and (2) trance-fers this defensive style on his spouse making them his ideal, thus protecting the old reality and avoiding the new reality. In most cases, the trance of idealization is a powerful defense the child uses to help her survive. The idealization trance enables the child to not feel, see, or even recognize the pain in her dysfunctional family . 132 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child Spiritualization The Third Level Processes Spiritualizing is the third level trance. It is an outgrowth of levels one and two. In order to spiritualize, an individual must go through the first two levels. Spiritualization is very deep, rooted in pre-verbal cognition and deeply involves survival. Spiritualizing is difficult to spot within oneself because books, philosophies, and \"spiritual groups\" help to validate the trance and continue to hypnotize the infant within the adult. It should be noted that not everyone goes through the trance of spiritualization. If an individual developmentally does not complete and pass through process one and the second process completely, they will stumble into the third process of spiritualization.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences of not completing the first two levels of inner child work, specifically idealization, as it may lead to the challenging trance of spiritualization. By acknowledging the various states and trances of spiritualization, we can work towards a more conscious and grounded approach to our spiritual journey."
