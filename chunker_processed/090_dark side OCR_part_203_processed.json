  "title": "What is the dark side of the inner child and how does it affect our sense of responsibility and boundaries?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores various adult problem states that stem from childhood experiences like magical thinking and grandiosity. These experiences are re-enforced by parents who make statements like \"You make me angry.\" The last part (200 tokens) delves deeper into the problem states of loss of boundary, loss of self, and over-responsibility. The author explains how these states arise from pre-verbal assumptions developed in infancy and how they continue to affect relationships in adulthood. In essence, the text sheds light on the various ways in which childhood experiences can shape our behavior and thinking as adults.",
  "content": "Adult Problem State: Loss of self, giving up oneself to get love. Often children give up their power, ideas, etc. to get love from their parents. The child believes, \"I control them (parents) by controlling my feelings. If I can control my feelings, I can control their feelings. I' m in charge.\" Picture a child who becomes angry, and in response, the parents get angry to control the child. The child controls and represses his anger. The parents smile and give him a hug. From the point of view of the child, by controlling his behavior, he can control others' behaviors and how others feel about him. This is the resistance to being out of control or powerless. Grandiosity resists the perceived chaos of pow- erlessness that the child experienced. The child cannot acknowledge its powerlessness so, to regain a state of power, he cognizes he is responsible and in charge of how others feel about him. \"If I control my thoughts, feelings or actions, I can control their reactions, thoughts, or feelings about me.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the damaging effects of giving up oneself to gain love and control, leading to the resistance of powerlessness and the emergence of grandiosity. Healing from such experiences requires an understanding of one's beliefs and cognitions and a willingness to confront one's emotions and limitations, towards a healthier and more authentic sense of self."
