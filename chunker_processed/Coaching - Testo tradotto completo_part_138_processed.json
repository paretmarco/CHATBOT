  "title": "\"Why is nurturing one's originality crucial in a society founded on fear?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author emphasizes the importance of nurturing one's originality and fighting against societal pressures to conform. The author argues that discovering and cultivating one's own originality is a duty we owe to the world. To achieve this, daring to rebel against one's environment is a necessity. The author also stresses the importance of remembering our smallness and the insignificance of our individual selves while avoiding excessive earnestness. In the final 200 tokens, the author suggests that we must learn to strip every fact of its emotional content to develop a more open-minded perspective. By reducing ideas to their objective nature, we can train our spirits to welcome them calmly.",
  "content": "On the one hand, this resolute conviction in our negligibility will render us less selfish, by making us acquainted with the extent of foolishness and ignorance which causes one to pretend that every person should be concerned with our affairs, whereas, on the other hand, it will make us more healthily selfish by conferring on us the coolness which is needed for the realization of the most arduous tasks. What is more is that we will also learn how to avoid that excessive earnestness which represents one of the major stumbles on the path to enjoying life and developing a more open-minded vision of it. Hardly, if at all, does the destiny of the world depend on the self of any one of us. As far as the world is concerned, we are in fact nothing. We should then pay the world back with the same coinage. That way, we will first and foremost learn how to strip every fact of its emotional content, by reducing it to its stark objective nature. Due to the fact that an idea is devoid of any consequence unless it is coloured by sentiment either in black or in pink, we must keep on training the spirit to welcome ideas in a calm way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing our own insignificance can humble us and make us more aware of the world around us. We can use this to detach ourselves from emotional reactions and approach life with a calm and clear mind, allowing us to tackle difficult tasks and enjoy the journey with an open mind."
