  "title": "\"How does interpretive distortion contribute to addiction to abusive relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses interpretative distortion as a form of kinesthetic blocking-out, where physical or emotional abuse can be interpreted as pleasurable or affectionate due to a repeated negative experience. The individual might not question or acknowledge the abuse, leading to addiction to abusive relationships. The article cites a few examples, including a client who was raped by her husband and saw it as ‘the way it is.’ The text also highlights the challenging aspect of detecting and addressing this issue. The article shows how individuals develop such distorted interpretations that can cause long-term negative effects.",
  "content": "In transactional analysis negative strokes are considered better than no strokes. This is a particularly difficult process in that the Blocking Out + 75 blocking-out is interpreted as enjoyable or as how it should be, and is therefore not questioned, nor acknowledged. I saw a man once whose father was a minister in Southern Ohio. His father quite often would bring the boy down to the basement. There he would have him pull down his pants, and spank him. The boy felt incredible pain, but eventually interpreted the sensations as pleasurable. Years later, he was involved in sado-masochist sex. Upon entering therapy, he felt that his interest in being physically hurt, which gave him sexual pleasure, was going too far, i.e., he had put himself in life-threatening situations. After many sessions, images began to appear in his memory. While his father was spanking him, his father would masturbate. Here the child within blocked out the pain of the spanking and interpreted it as pleasur- able, because it was the only way he seemed to get love and affection from Dad. Years later, this generalized to the only way to get sexual love and affection: by being spanked or hurt physically.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of blocking-out in Transactional Analysis can have profound effects on an individual's behavior later in life. Negative and positive strokes can be interpreted in different ways by a child, leading to unconscious blocking-out of pain and intensified pleasure through sado-masochistic experiences. Therefore, it is essential to recognize early signs of blocking-out and address them through therapy to prevent life-threatening situations like these."
