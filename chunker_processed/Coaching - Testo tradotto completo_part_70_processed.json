  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the dangers of being trapped in habits and the importance of breaking free from them in order to experience true freedom and live a fulfilling life. The last 200 tokens focus on the concept of originality as a cornerstone for personal development. The text emphasizes the need for individuals to understand their unique nature and cultivate their inner gifts and ideas outside of any restricting framework in order to unleash the true power of their minds. The author delves into the significance of originality as a primary norm for progress and urges readers to embrace it as an unshakeable purpose.",
  "content": "If we cross a road we had never walked on before, we will feel that road to be longer the first time around as compared to the return trip. The reason for it is that, on our way back, the road is already more familiar, whereupon we are less alert and less in search of new information; it likewise ensues from the said truth that when we live in automatic responses, time is as if swallowed, and years fly by in a matter of seconds. If we desire to experience development, it is accordingly imperative that we should be able to exit the limiting boundaries. Once we come to understand our true nature, we are also going to realize that there are gifts, thoughts, ideas which are deeply ours and which truly have their source in our innermost being. We are indeed a unique combination of elements, and we must become conscious of that fact. Originality, this primary norm which antedates any possible progress, is a cornerstone urging to be developed, away from any restricting framework, as an unshakeable purpose which the genuine adept of this method ought to cling to. Originality represents the exteriorization of the true power of the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if we want to lead a life full of growth and originality, we must break free from the limiting boundaries of automatic responses and passive ideation. This involves eliminating useless habits and being open to new, unfamiliar roads. Stay focused on the one fundamental rule of being original, and success will follow."
