  "title": "How can letter vibrations create your reality and attract success and wellbeing?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the Sixth Protocol comes to an end, focusing on the power of visualization and the sensation of sound. It suggests that our thoughts can become reality when we create mental images and let them manifest. The Final Examination of the Second Level involves measuring material success and well-being. The Way of Sound is explored, where the vibration of sound is used to manifest thoughts into reality. The following exercises help to develop the magnetic power of sounds. The first method suggests repeating letters for energizing or eliminating negative influences, while the second method involves creating resonance with the universe by resonating specific sounds in various directions.",
  "content": "Sono paralleli al lavoro svolto coi vari protocolli e ne possono incrementare l'efficacia. Metodo 1 - Japa Yoga Con la ripetizione di lettere secondo lo Japa Yoga Alcune formule di potere sono EF - per caricarsi di energia. DC - per eliminare influssi negativi OM - AUM - questa formula può creare tranquillità Metodo 2 - Le direzioni Mentali Il metodo delle direzioni mentali aiuta a creare comunanza con l'universo. In pratica facciamo risuonare (come se fossero fuori da noi) suoni specifici nelle varie direzioni dello spazio.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these methods, parallel to traditional protocols, can increase their effectiveness. By practicing Japa Yoga, mental directions, charging body parts with letters, resonating internal and external letters, and projecting them onto reality, we can modify and enhance qualities, sensations, and even reduce pain. We can also apply the additional attraction protocol associated with the moon to promote attraction, repulsion, or impulse by understanding the currents of energy. With practice and dedication, we can harness the power of sound to improve our lives and those around us."
