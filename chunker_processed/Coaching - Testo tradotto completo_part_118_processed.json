  "title": "How can we integrate ourselves for true happiness and success?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author explains the practical reflections of the exercises mentioned before. The concept of \"reintegration\" of oneself and reality is introduced, emphasizing the importance of being connected to oneself to establish a real life plan and achieve happiness. The author argues that the dispersion mentioned earlier in the text leads to disintegration, and to overcome it, one must gather mental energy to attain practical purposes. The text suggests that reaching the absolute zero state of consciousness can help achieve this aim, as it allows one to be aware of the void and perceive reality beyond one's thoughts. The author acknowledges that different people might have different ways of achieving this state, such as denying attention to any conscious thought or driving away ideas persistently.",
  "content": "Ours must be a genuine war strategy: The thought, the mental energy, must not be found scattered across too vast a space, for otherwise no propelling force and no countering power might possibly be deployed. If, on the other hand, we manage to gather our energies in a single bundle, we might successfully resist a formidable collision, or even be able to launch in turn an attack of ours against some fortress. Being Present - The relativity of everything It is now time to move to some reflections which, though broader, do not thereby cease to be predominantly practical. The underlying concept we would like to introduce you to here is the extent to which the preceding exercises might also represent exercises aiming at the reintegration and reclaiming of our own selves. We cannot, indeed, be truly happy or establish any real life plan so long as we are not connected to our own selves and to reality. Why do we speak of re-integration? The answer to that question is found in yet another question: To which extent are we actually dis-integrated? The dispersion we have dealt with in the previous pages of this book is in fact a dis-integration.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to gather our mental energy to deploy a propelling force, resist a collision or launch an attack of our own, and reintegrate with our true selves to establish a meaningful life plan. By being present in reality, we can exercise our limited free will and live a more authentic and fulfilled life."
