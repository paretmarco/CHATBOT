  "title": "What is presentification and how can it lead to success?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, the author discusses the importance of firm resoluteness in achieving one's goals. They argue that by committing to carrying out ideas beforehand and reflecting on any obstacles that may arise, we can approach the future with a sense of satisfaction and perseverance. The author also introduces the concept of \"multiplication and absorption of the idea,\" which involves multiplying the energy of presentification and absorbing it through the body. This technique, while not always necessary, can be beneficial for executing more complex operations. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of staying committed to one's goals and approaches to achieve them.",
  "content": "An important factor behind success will be detected by us once we simultaneously pause to resolve on acting tenaciously and on incessantly persevering until we have actualized our intended goal. Such a kind of firm resoluteness ought to be imparted, more than by a conscious effort of our will, by a sort of intense prayer which is going to pervade the core of our being, and which is going to be given renewed impetus by the excellence of our cause, as well as by sensing the fact that it forms part of a global plan. Second passage: The mental multiplication of the idea We refer, by the term “multiplication and absorption of the idea”, to the operation which comes after presentification. This operation is not one which is invariably required. On some occasions, indeed, it might even be omitted. It is of benefit, however, in executing the more complex variety of operations. It consists in the fact that it multiplies the energy of presentification, and lets it be absorbed by the body through the technique of the light.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve success, it is crucial to act tenaciously and persevere incessantly towards our goals, instilling a strong sense of resoluteness by means of intense prayer and the realization that our cause is part of a larger plan. Additionally, the multiplication and absorption of ideas through quantum techniques like those utilized for making ourselves magnetic can help us appropriate the idea more effectively. To put it simply, close your eyes, verbalize your presentification, and look at the light."
