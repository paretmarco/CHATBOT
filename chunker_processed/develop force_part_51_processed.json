  "title": "\"What are the exercises for developing inner power and fascination based on Etruscan tradition?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on inner power and the development of fascination through a series of exercises. The first mentioned exercise, \"hot water and cold water,\" is one of the oldest techniques in the Virgilio t. tradition of modifying perceptions. The subsequent exercises aim to awaken the central fire and work on inter-hemispheric coordination, including focus on the aura and performing movements of a lying eight with the head. The final exercises, using breath and non-conditioning, deepen control over perceptions and access an aerial dimension symbolized by early development of mercury.",
  "content": "When we operate at the same time on two hands then we arrive at a new and higher sense of unity. Exercise 28: Hot water and cold water. 1) Put a basin with cold water to the right 2) Put a basin with hot water to the left 3) Put a hand in the basin of cold water and a hand in warm water basin and at the same time try to reverse the perceptions. Some will totally. Others will only partly. Anyway, make the maximum effort and act without using the imagination (so you do not have e.g. to imagine ice) but the willpower only. Note, it could seem it was you heating the water. Then you will see that you actually have achieved control over your perceptions. Exercise 29: With breathing Perform the same exercise again, but holding breath The exercise has a strong symbolic value. The first symbol of the exercise: the non conditioning With this exercise our being is no more influenced from temperatures of \"waters\" (symbolized by an arrow that goes down ? ). The second symbol of the exercise: the upper dimension With this exercise, you log on to an aerial dimension that is no longer tied to \"land\" (symbol ? ). The tradition symbolized this dimension by an early development of mercury (symbol r). Namely we are at a point where the polarities meet and can be controlled.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises for sensory development and visualization, when practiced with dedication and focus, can lead to an increased sense of control over one's perceptions and mental material. They can also enhance personal influence and aid in creating deeper connections with others. While achieving advanced results may require more extensive training, anyone can benefit from beginning with the passive imagination phase and gradually building up their abilities. By doing so, they may discover a new level of unity and wholeness within themselves."
