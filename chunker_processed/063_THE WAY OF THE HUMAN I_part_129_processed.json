  "title": "How important is context when manifesting your goals and desires?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author discusses the importance of context in manifestation and how distorted beliefs such as \"wanting equals getting\" can mislead us from reality. The author compares this to a child who learns that controlling their internal state can get them what they want from their parents, and similarly, people may think they can control their external reality through their thoughts and beliefs. However, the author cautions that ignoring the external context can lead to being blind-sided and unprepared for challenges. The author emphasizes the importance of handling the external world and paying attention to context to avoid getting bitten by unprocessed issues.",
  "content": "In other words, your perceptions must be grounded in physical reality otherwise you will be misled by the infantile understanding which collapses the levels and manifests as the distortionâ€”\"If I control my internal (beliefs, images, etc. ), I can control my external\" (the world). This can be related back to a child who, when they control their feelings, actions, thoughts, etc., mom or dad gives them what they want. They are told by mom and dad they got what they wanted because they deserved it for being good. Years later, they trance-fer mom and dad onto the world or God, imagining if they control their internal, and are good and virtuous, according to mom/dad's standards, they will get what they want from the world or God (mom/dad). because they deserve it. If you don't handle the external world and pay attention to the context in which you are living, at some point it will come up and bite you. You'll be blind-sided. The external world will pull up that which is unprocessed (uncooked seeds).",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, it's essential to have a realistic understanding of the external world and recognize its impact on our internal beliefs and perceptions. By staying grounded and attentive to our surroundings, we can ensure that unprocessed issues do not arise and manifest in distorted ways. Through open-eyed exercises, we can learn to notice the difference and approach life with a more balanced perspective."
