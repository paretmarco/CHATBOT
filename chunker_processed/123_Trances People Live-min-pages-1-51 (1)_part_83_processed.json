  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the concept of context in therapy, contrasting it with Erickson's concept of the unconscious mind as a storehouse of resources that can be accessed in therapeutic trance. The author finds the concept of context more useful, as it empowers individuals by viewing the mind as an organic entity that continuously creates states of being, rather than compartmentalizing it into conscious and unconscious parts. Understanding context gives individuals greater control over their own minds. Overall, the text argues that identifying too closely with a problem can limit resources, but disidentifying and understanding context empowers individuals seeking solutions.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of context can empower you by giving you control over the workings of your mind. Rather than compartmentalizing your thoughts, you can see your mind as an organic entity that creates different states of being. With this knowledge, you can choose the areas of your past experiences that you want to explore and use them to bring about change without conscious awareness. Think of your mind as a library, and by turning the flashlight of your awareness onto different sections, you can gain newfound clarity and understanding."
