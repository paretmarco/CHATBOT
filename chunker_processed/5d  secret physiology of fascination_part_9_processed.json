  "title": "How can peripheral movements affect our spatial orientation and attention during complex visual tasks such as flying an aircraft?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the importance of binocular function in merging visual fields into one distinct image. The author explains how altering binocular function can affect peripheral vision and balance. Additionally, using peripheral movements can affect the perception of body position. The text suggests that absorbing the spirit of the person in front of us is related to arousal levels. By using hands as visual cues, individuals can increase attention and monitor body position relative to gravity. In interpreting radar contact information while flying an aircraft, the subconscious use of peripheral information is used to maintain spatial orientation.",
  "content": "Different visual areas contribute to the processing of visual information coming from different parts of the visual field, and a complex of visual areas located along the banks of the interhemispheric fissure (a deep groove that separates the two brain hemispheres) has been linked to peripheral vision. It has been suggested that these areas are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery, and monitoring body position relative to gravity. (Palmer SM, Rosa MG (2006). \"A distinct anatomical network of cortical areas for analysis of motion in far peripheral vision\". Eur J Neurosci 24 (8): 2389–405. doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05113.x. PMID 17042793) PERIPHERAL MOVEMENT ABSORBING This refer to absorbing the spirit of the person in front of us Arousal Definition of Arousal \"arousal (arous·al) ([schwa]-rou¢z[schwa]l) 1. a state of responsiveness to sensory stimulation or excitability We all have peaks and valleys in our arousal levels throughout the day. However most of us manage to maintain an appropriate level of arousal by the some of the strategies listed above to interact effectively with the environment.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the complex visual areas responsible for peripheral vision and their link to fast reactions and body positioning can help us absorb movements and understand arousal levels. It's also important to consider the impacts of binocular and monocular vision on myopia and the possible effects of tension on eye torsion."
