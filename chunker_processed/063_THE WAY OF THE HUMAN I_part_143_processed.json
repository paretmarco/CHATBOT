  "title": "How can you maintain a balanced relationship without losing yourself?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author discusses the challenge of balancing personal identity with intimate relationships and suggests a technique of self-remembering to achieve it. Drawing inspiration from the approach used by Fourth Way teacher G.I. Gurdjieff, the author advocates for simultaneously focusing on two dimensions of reality – the internal thinking world and the external world – to achieve a balanced perspective. The thinking world includes beliefs, assumptions, decisions, values and images, each with a unique function. The author highlights the need to recognize and balance all dimensions of reality to avoid favoring one over the other.",
  "content": "This approach asks the practWoner to do precisely this technique of self-remembering: To focus on the thinking dimension (inside) and the external world (outside), simultaneously, and in a balanced way. Ultimately in Quantum Psychology, we will later ask much more, i.e., to focus on three or more dimensions simultaneously. The thinking world contains our beliefs, trances, assumptions, decisions, and values at a thinking level. It comprises not only what we think _and believe, but also the world of images. For example, imagine you are sitting and all of a sudden you have an image of the beach, or you have an image of the mountains, or you have an image of the relationship that you want, or you have an image of your mother, or your father, or a past event, or a future event—all those different images are part of the thinking world. Of course, emotions are involved and connected with beliefs, but as we see the levels, we realize that they have different functions. Unfortunately, we often favor one dimension of reality over another.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the technique of self-remembering can help us maintain a healthy balance between the internal and external dimensions of reality. By focusing on both simultaneously, we can avoid falling into trances or losing touch with present time reality. Ultimately, mastering the art of multi-dimensional awareness can greatly enhance our understanding of the world around us and improve our relationships with others."
