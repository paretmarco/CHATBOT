  "title": "\"What is Quantum Observation and how does it relate to the concept of condensation in consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This section discusses the concept of condensation and its relationship to consciousness. It is noted that everything is a condensation of one consciousness and that understanding this is crucial to moving beyond the observer-observed dyad and into pure awareness. The exercise provided helps differentiate between the different aspects of consciousness and move towards pure being. Prior to this, the text discusses the thinking dimension and how it shapes our interpretation of the world.",
  "content": "For example, if you have a troublesome thought, call it a thought; if you have a troublesome internal voice, call it an internal dialogue. In this way, you will be able to differentiate between the different aspects of consciousness. Step III: Dialogue with the aspect. Ask the aspect, \"What are you resisting knowing about yourself?\" Write down your answers until nothing \"pops up.\" Step IV: Notice what the aspect is resisting as you continue to enquire. Step V: Realizing what the aspect is ultimately resisting, allow the aspect to experience what it is resisting and then notice the Chapter VI EMPTINESS surrounding it and \"see/experience\" the EMPTINESS and the aspect as the same substance. Step VI: Stay in the nonverbal I AM level prior to the arising of thoughts and JUST BE (to be discussed later). This is the I AM which leads to the NOT-I I beyond observation (i.e. the observer-observed dyad.) This exercise will hopefully help to open the doorway and help to stabilize beyond your identification with the thinking dimension. SUMMARY SO FAR The thinking dimension is how we (the nervous system) think and interpret the world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the steps outlined above, you can begin to differentiate between the various aspects of consciousness and overcome troublesome thoughts and internal dialogues. As you cultivate awareness of the thinking dimension, you can discard limiting thoughts and open the doorway to stabilize your identification beyond it. Remember, one dimension is not higher or lower than another; it is up to you to choose which dimensions to give your attention to."
