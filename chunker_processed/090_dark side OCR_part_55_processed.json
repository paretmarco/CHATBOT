  "title": "What is age regression and how does it affect our relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses age regression and how it affects relationships. The process of becoming one's inner child creates blind spots, making it difficult to live in the present and causing behavior to appear as if it were from a prior time. The author uses Illustration #2 to demonstrate transference and countertransference. In this trance, the inner child projects the parent onto the other person, causing one to lose their present-time relationship. The task is to take responsibility for the inner child identity and observe it without creating a window to view present reality.",
  "content": "In essence, both husband and wife become their age-regressed inner-child identity and project the parent on the other person, thus losing their present-time relationship. Age regression describes the process an adult goes through as he becomes the inner child. This creates blind spots. A relationship cannot work if neither person is in present time. Interactions are \"time frozen,\" because NOW is experienced as if it were a prior time. Consequently, behavior appears as if it were now, while actually a person is acting as if he were a child or adolescent in his family. The Task 1. Identify when you become or feel younger than you are. 2. Notice when it occurs and what triggers it. 3. Notice where in your physical or mental space the inner child resides. For example, is the inner child in your mental space, physical body, both? 4. Watch and observe the inner child identity. 5. Observe and take responsibility for the created inner child identity. 6. Notice that you are the observer and creator of the inner child identity window you are looking through. 7. Learn to stop creating the inner child identity as a window to view present reality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, acknowledging and taking responsibility for our age regression and inner child identity is essential for healthy relationships. By following the steps outlined, we can identify and observe our inner child, breaking the habit of projecting our past onto present experiences. By doing so, we can de-hypnotize ourselves and gain control, ensuring that our relationships and interactions remain in present time."
