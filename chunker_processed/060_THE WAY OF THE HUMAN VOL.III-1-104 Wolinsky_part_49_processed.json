  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of \"Beyond Quantum Psychology\", Barbara discusses the hardest part of accepting that she will never be able to merge with her mother again. She expresses the creature comforts of connection and how all the ways they merged can no longer be experienced. She shares that the essential connection with her mother remains, even after her passing. Wolinsky questions whether the merger was ever truly satisfying or always missing something. Barbara admits that there was always something missing, yet the essential connection with her mother remains intact.",
  "content": "Can you say to me, I have to give up the idea that I'll ever be able to merge again. The hardest part is really giving up that I can never merge with my mother again. Good, say that again. The hardest part is accepting and giving up the fact that I can never merge with her again in all the ways we merged. Say that again. The hardest part is not ever having that merger with my mother in the way I had grown accustomed to. The way I could feel connected to her. I can't ever merge with her again that way. ________________ Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: ________________ Now, the question I have is, the kind of merger that you had with your mother, was it truly ever really satisfying? Or was there always a sense of something missing? Something was always missing and when I saw her at Thanksgiving, the essential connection was there and if I'm honest, that's not gone. Can you say to me, I have an Essential Connection if I'm honest with myself and it's not gone?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, accepting and giving up the fact that we can never merge with a loved one in the same way again can be one of the most challenging things in life. However, it's important to be honest with ourselves and acknowledge the essential connection that still exists, while avoiding mental constructs and grandiosity that may impede our healing process."
