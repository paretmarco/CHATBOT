  "title": "How to Create a Well-Thought-Out Life Plan for Commitment and Pleasure?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author emphasizes the need to establish a well-thought-out life plan by taking into account personal and external considerations. The plan should reflect one's innate tendencies and personal direction without opposing them, and set up conditions that favor their development. The author also talks about the importance of committing to the plan and having a corresponding program of pleasures that underpin the scope of our life. The text concludes by highlighting the various types of pleasures, including sensory, intellectual, economic, family-related, and social.",
  "content": "There remains the problem of the eclectic persons, of those versatile souls who are devoid of a single neatly demarcated tendency. One might possibly suggest to them to study the most favourable external conditions by seeking help from their unconscious. Many other considerations will have to be drawn into the effort of setting up a well thought-out plan: Both the relevant external considerations (the environment in which one lives, his family and social ties, his economic possibilities, and even the political regime under which his life takes place) and, with even greater force, the personal considerations of a physical as well as a spiritual nature 60. Commitment and pleasure The life plan thus examined and drawn up, will thus prove to be a plan of commitments and directions. These commitments will be pleasant because they reflect our own selves, yet such commitments will have to be echoed by another program, a corresponding program of pleasures acting as background and underpinning scope of our life. Our view tends to include within the list of pleasures even the pleasure of doing: The pleasing exercise of all our activities. We will thus have sensory and intellectual pleasures, economic, family-related and social ones.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, creating a well thought-out life plan involves considering both external and personal factors, and setting commitments and directions that reflect our true selves. In addition, it is crucial to identify and prioritize a range of pleasures that can be integrated into daily life, from the sensory and intellectual to the rare and extraordinary. By working towards these pleasures on a steady basis, we can ensure a fulfilling and meaningful life."
