  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it liberate awareness from the False Core False Self?",
  "first_phrase": "The final 200 tokens of this text continue the discussion on spiritual practice and the limitations of transcendence through temporary means such as mantra, yantra, or tantra. The text explores the concept of cooking the uncooked seeds of the False Core-False Self and liberating and stabilizing awareness. The ultimate goal is to live life with awareness of all dimensions until awareness itself disappears, and one is absorbed into the Void of Undifferentiated Consciousness and the Nameless Absolute is revealed.",
  "content": "It is an Enlightenment prison which limits what you can or cannot do, say, think, have, experience, know, and discuss. In short, it is the maintenance of a \"state\" and as a basic Buddhist teaching of impermanence saysâ€”all states and everything are impermanent.\" Or as Nisargadatta Maharaj would say, \"Who came first, you or the state?\" Saying further, \"What do you care what state you are in? I am not in a state.\" Quantum Psychology is interested in liberating and stabilizing awareness by cooking the uncooked seeds of your False Core-False Self. The ideal for now, but not meant as a goal to be achieved, is to live your life and have awareness of all dimensions simultaneously until naturally awareness itself disappears (Volume III). In other words, the liberation of awareness naturally becomes a function of awareness. Awareness can then be in any dimension, all dimensions or no-dimensions. Eventually awareness goes beyond awareness itself as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS absorbs the \"you\" you call yourself. \"Then\" the VOID ends, or voids itself, and the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE is revealed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a unique perspective on the nature of the False Core-False Self and how it drives our actions and perceptions. By liberating our awareness and stabilizing our consciousness, we can break free from the constraints of the False Self and achieve a state of true liberation. Remember, whatever you do, you do for your own sake, but true freedom comes from transcending the limitations of the False Self and embracing the Nameless Absolute beyond."
