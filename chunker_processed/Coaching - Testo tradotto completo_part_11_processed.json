  "title": "\"Is it possible to achieve success and maximize time with a simple method amidst the chaos of everyday life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author addresses multiple questions about how to operate in the field of free activity in order to increase efficiency, reduce effort, and achieve success. These questions include how to find a method to stay focused amidst the tumult of everyday life, reduce the role of chance, and eradicate wandering thoughts. The author argues that by answering these questions, we can derive maximum benefit and achieve success in all our endeavors. The section concludes by warning against the temptation of giving up and rationalizing our failures.",
  "content": "In the light of the fact that the world is shaped by chance, is it possible to discover a method whereby we can exploit each and every situation, in such a manner as to definitely derive from it, at all times, the maximum benefit or the least possible harm? Is it possible to eradicate the cerebral wandering which alone absorbs the greatest part of our psychological activity? Is it possible to make use of this energy saving by employing it for the implementation of necessary actions in a humanly perfect way? We are thus faced with a number of problems to which we assign one and the same affirmative answer. The aim of this book does not stop at making you gain, as it also leads you to generally achieve success in whatever you do. Many people act out Lafontaineâ€™s fable of the sour grapes attitude: Because the grape is dangling from too high a place, the fox declares it to be sour. Plentiful people give up and then rationalize their act of renunciation. The truth, however, is that the grape is not sour. A lot of people give up and supply their own selves with justifications for doing so.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this book aims to help you discover a method to make the most out of every situation and use your energy effectively to achieve success. Don't let the temptation to rationalize failure hold you back. By practicing self-control and liberating your basic energy, you can turn the paradox of hard work but little success into a thing of the past. Start acting now and take charge of your own destiny."
