  "content": "Uses in real life of hypno-magnetism are in: intuition and creativity development, healing, etc… Real Hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism can be allied and combined. Hypnomagnetic responses can trigger hypnomentalistic reactions. Our goal is both to bring to the present world the knowledge of these powerful techniques in many case almost forgotten, both to empower the practitioner of real abilities and capabilities. About REAL hypno-mentalism: This is the real stuff… no add ons of other types should be used. It is true that there are some performers that say achieve hypno-mentalism effects, but sometimes they use psychological tricks instead of relying on pure intuition. In this blog we speak instead of the real stuff that has to do with developing our mind potential. Pure and real mental magic. Real Hypno-mentalism should be done without any help of the rational mind. It must be done in the more real and participative way and requires an adequate ambiance, and the effects will be striking! In fact if you use psychological tricks you activate your cortical responses and reduce your deeper concentration and will rely on your rationality. Here we delve instead deep inside our mind and we use these exercises as a training for intuition and sensitivity. The performer should always start from the idea that he will get the effect exactly as previewed. Mind and non verbal communication will create the necessary atmosphere.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypno-magnetism and hypno-mentalism provide powerful techniques for developing intuition and creativity, as well as improving healing and personal growth. Real, pure mental magic requires working without the assistance of the rational mind and creates an environment conducive to deeper concentration and intuition. Through the Hermetic Magnetism course, we can learn to access the secret energy of the mind and unlock our inner potential. With the assistance of an expert team lead by Dr. Marco Paret, we are empowered to reach new levels of knowledge and effectiveness in our personal and professional lives."
