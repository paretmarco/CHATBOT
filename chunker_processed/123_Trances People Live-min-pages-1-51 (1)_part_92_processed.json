A woman I worked with, who had teen sexually abused as a child, was plagued by chronic back pain. whenever she was in a sexual situation, her back and pelvic area would respond with sensations of pain. Consequently, she did not have sex- In looking at how she created this traumatized response in present time, I saw that it began by her focusing all her attention to that arta---she was aware solely of the sensations in her back and relv15. Secondly, she dissociated from the experience; her self or\"1\" would go into trances of dissociation and amnesia which were the Mme trance phenomena she had developed as a child to handle the nperience of being made to have sex with her stepfather.

By expanding a person's sense of their body as an organic whole and connecting it to their sense of self as well as redirecting their attention to other regions of their body, they may be able to relieve their symptoms and move forward in a more integrated way."
