  "title": "\"What is Quantum Psychology and How Does it Differ from Traditional Approaches to Healing?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author talks about Quantum Psychology, which differs from traditional psychological and spiritual systems. The author believes that any attempt to heal, reframe, or rename the False Core reinforces it instead of helping to move beyond it. According to the author, you are not your False Core, but identifying with it only strengthens it. This idea aligns with Nisargadatta Maharaj's belief that to transcend the mind, one must look away from it. The previous section discusses the layered psychology of a woman who became a psychologist to reinforce her defenses against past trauma.",
  "content": "THE DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE Quantum Psychology differs radically from any system, be it \"psychological\" or spiritual, which believes you are your False Core or False Self and which attempts to heal it, reframe it, make it \"better,\" keep the \"good,\" get rid of the \"bad,\" convert vices into virtues, re-associate it, rename it, re-frame it, polish it and, ultimately, even observe it. Quantum Psychology suggests this is just moving around furniture. The question is, Who is moving the furniture and trying to re-form the False Core? Quantum Psychology maintains that any attempt to do these things contains an underlying judgment and assumption that you are your False Core. For Quantum Psychology you are not your False Core. Your False Core is not who you are. 37 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The more you identify with your False Core-False Self (even through transformation or healing), the more you reinforce it. According to Nisargadatta Maharaj, \"In order to go beyond the mind, you must look away (take your attention) from the mind and its contents.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology challenges the notion that you are your False Core or False Self and suggests that any attempt to heal or transform it reinforces its existence. Instead, this approach encourages identifying the false self and discarding it to discover the true self. Ultimately, the observer is also a part of the false self compensator, and the only way to transcend it is to take attention away from the mind and its contents."
