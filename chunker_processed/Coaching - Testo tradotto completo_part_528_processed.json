  "title": "How Can an Automatic Trading System Be Used in Financial Markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of the text, the author questions the impact of human emotions on trading decisions and wonders if an automatic trading system could provide a solution. The author has been on an experiential journey in trading but feels like they are going nowhere and possibly escaping from something. They realize that experiences are of no benefit unless used as resources towards set purposes. These insights were gained after spending a long time in front of a computer monitor and realizing the varying moods and sensations guiding their decisions. The author ponders on whether an automatic trading system could eliminate the influence of emotions on trading decisions.",
  "content": "That was the beginning of an experiential journey which alternated satisfactions and failures, until, all of a sudden, he realized that he was going nowhere and that he was possibly escaping from something. He knew what he did not want, fine, but he did not really know where he wanted to go. Experiences are of no benefit alone unless you use them as resources towards the purposes you have set for yourselves. After he had spent a long time in front of a computer monitor, he became aware of the fact that he had moods and sensations which kept on changing depending on the position he held in the market, on the decisions which had been taken, and on those which demanded to be taken. What is the use of all the studies of technical analysis and all the market tools if, ultimately, the decisions are conditional on one's varying moods and as such dictated by them? Could an automatic trading system be the solution?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to recognize that experiences alone cannot guide us towards our goals unless we employ them as valuable resources. Trading systems may work for a limited time, but ultimately, they will cease to be effective, making it crucial to continually educate ourselves and develop our skills to adapt to the ever-changing market conditions."
