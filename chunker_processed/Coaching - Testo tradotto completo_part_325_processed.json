  "first_phrase": "This text highlights the power of the unconscious mind in enabling us to perform various actions effortlessly. The author stresses the importance of pre-determination in establishing a sequence of operations leading to desirable outcomes. The text also explores the idea that intellectual work, like the inspiration felt by artists and poets, can also be achieved through automatism. In the last 200 tokens, the author suggests breaking up any action into smaller, logical parts to reduce the amount of conscious effort required. By doing so, even difficult tasks can be approached with ease. The author's practical method of reducing voluntary and conscious effort ultimately helps to ease the process of starting any action, from beginning a race to making a declaration of love.",
  "content": "Extending the help which the unconscious provides It is not only the acts of conservation, however, which ought to find their place within such modus operandi. Many more actions than what we might presume can be relinquished to the help of the unconscious: Break up the action, the work, into so many logically concatenated small actions, that is, into a series of small actions which are arranged in such a way that any one of them is going to inevitably summon the next one into being. Those difficulties which had previously appeared to be huge will then disappear as if through magic. One practicable method consists in reducing to a bare minimum the voluntary and conscious effort which is required to kick-start any thing. That is achieved by breaking up the act to be carried out into a sequence of minor acts. The beginning of a race consists in one initial step, the first part of swallowing up a bitter medicine is accosting the glass to one's lips, and the ignition key of a declaration of love is opening one's mouth!",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by extending the help of the unconscious to all aspects of our lives and breaking up actions into a series of small, logically connected steps, we can reduce conscious effort and overcome difficulties with ease. By premeditating our actions, managing our time, maintaining muscular relaxation, and letting go of emotionalism, we can accomplish our goals efficiently and with confidence."
