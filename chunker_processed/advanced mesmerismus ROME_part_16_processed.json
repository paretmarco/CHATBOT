  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author introduces techniques for nonverbal communication in therapy based on proxemics, sound, and touch. They explain the importance of equalizing the magnetic force in a patient and activating the spine. Additionally, the author discusses the closure of the senses technique and the ten plexuses technique, which can help create a magnetic state more quickly. The author also explains how to perform the hypnodrama technique and discusses the sway test, which can help stimulate unconscious answers. Understanding these techniques can help therapists better communicate with their clients and achieve better therapeutic results.",
  "content": "Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it) Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself ARCHETYPE (ex verticality) it exist into the Non verbal self False symbolism (excessive rigidity) We can increase ========================================== METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a \"history\" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ============================================ THE SWAYING TEST What is \"the test\"? The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is \"the human pendulum\". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved?",

Each technique is designed to help the therapist better understand their clients and help them achieve their goals.
