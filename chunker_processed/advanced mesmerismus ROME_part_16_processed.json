  "title": "How to use non-verbal communication and symbolism in therapy: Understanding archetypes and false symbolism, using techniques such as hypnodrama and magnetic passes, and learning to read clientsâ€™ reactions. Exploring different levels of moving therapy and somnambulism.",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the world of nonverbal communication in hypnotherapy. The first part defines true and false symbolism and describes how identifying a symbol with just one side of the individual can cause a psychological charge. The text then moves on to nonverbal hypnosis and introduces techniques like magnetic passes, touch, and sound to induce a hypnotic state. The text also discusses closure of senses, 10 plexuses technique, and the twelve passes to equalize the magnetic force. The exercises provided include testing balance and doing hypnodrama, while the text also offers a method to heal spine pains and sciatica.",
  "content": "Increasing a derivate symbolism brings to a trance and finally a crisis when the increased archetype meets the other disowned part (many times it happens naturally but sometimes we can suggest it) Increasing a true archetypes change dimension of the being that feels he owns himself ARCHETYPE (ex verticality) it exist into the Non verbal self False symbolism (excessive rigidity) We can increase ========================================== METHOD 2 of doing the HYPNODRAMA: as a sort of SELF CRISIS You can even do the hypnodrama simpler on a table Put the two hands in front create one or two times attraction between your two hands have the hands coming together NOTE: For the hypnodrama it is good you create a \"history\" that will help the reaction as for example: Right hand many psychologist identify as the father and former generations Left hand many psychologists identify as the mother and former generations Or just right and left are two different energies coming together You can put together some more ideas ============================================ THE SWAYING TEST What is \"the test\"? The test is a way to stimulate unconscious answer It is \"the human pendulum\". USE: after having dobe the test the client will be more reactive DOING THE TEST Have the person think to semething he likes and dislike and see the answer 1 stay by side 2 imagine something you desire / or not 3 did you notice you moved?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the techniques and exercises discussed in the past few days of therapy can be powerful tools for helping clients work through their issues and achieve their desired goals. From increasing archetypes to using the sway test and magnetic passes, these methods can lead to deep trance and even past life regression. By incorporating non-verbal communication and breathing techniques, somnambulism, and working with muscular and magnetic preferences, therapists can help clients overcome a wide range of issues. However, it is important to remember that magnetism must be treated with reverence, and clients should always be treated with care and respect during these sessions."
