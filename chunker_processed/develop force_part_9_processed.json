  "first_phrase": "This final section of the text delves deeper into the practice of fascination, or the art of exercising a powerful influence with the look. The author introduces Virgilio T., their mentor and last custodian of the secrets of this ancient school. Through Virgilio, the author and their friends learned the disciplined work upon one’s own self needed to attain such power. The text also highlights the scientific basis behind the otherwise inexplicable therapeutic ability possessed by several healers. Finally, the author explores the fields of utilization of fascination, including how it can be used to develop attractive charm and create an instantaneous hypnosis.",
  "content": "It does not end here, however. Though we have been introduced to the technique, we can personally attest to the fact that there are still many obscure points in need of clarification, as regards the degree of potency of this hidden and extraordinary power. Fields of utilization of fascination “Fascination is actualized by a lucid and subtle virtue which the heat of the heart gives birth to as one equipped with a purer blood. This heat is emanated in the form of rays which, emitted by open eyes fixing their gaze with strong imaginative power, ultimately produce a wound in the object of their look, touch the heart, and succeed in afflicting the other person’s heart and spirit, either with love or hatred, with envy, melancholia, or some other kindred emotional force. Feeling the attraction of love is a phenomenon which takes place when two people frequently eye one another through a direct, intense look. In that case, visual rays, mutually radiating, meet one another, and light is wedded to light. It is at that point that spirits are conjoined together, and that the superior light, by indoctrinating the lower one, shimmers through the eyes, and races to penetrate into the inner spirit, the one that is rooted in the heart; it is in that fashion that an amorous conflagration is stirred into being.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination is the art of captivating people through the eyes, and it can be achieved through proper training and mastery of the gaze. It has various applications, including persuasion, therapy, and personal growth. While the eye is essential to human culture, it also holds mystical properties, including the possibility of awakening a third eye that leads to a higher vision. However, one must also be cautious about the power of the gaze and use it wisely. With practice and self-mastery, the art of fascination can be a valuable tool for personal and professional success. It does not end here, though; there is much to learn and experience in the world of fascination."
