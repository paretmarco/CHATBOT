  "first_phrase": "This text explores various NLP techniques and concepts applicable to different aspects of life such as therapy, personal development, and business. In the last 200 tokens, it focuses on the Time Line technique, which represents a metaphor for reorganizing memory and reactions in the present. The technique can be used to eliminate negative states of mind and anxiety, achieve objectives, and more. The author emphasizes the importance of visualization, positive thinking, and autosuggestion in inducing change in behavior and perception. The text also touches on autogenous training, anchoring, and the power of the mind in reprogramming negative learning to positive learning.",
  "content": "TIME LINE EXTRACTION If you had to indicate where you could find your past in the space around you, where would you put it? Point to it with your finger. And where is your future? Now think of something you did yesterday. OK? Now think of something you will do tomorrow. OK? Do you notice that there can be a difference between the two images? What is the difference? Now think of something you did one year ago. Now think of something you will do in a few years time. Where would you put them? Join the points with an imaginary line. Make them realise it exists and it is managed at an unconscious level. At this point, once the time line has been extracted, it can be used in various ways: to eliminate a state of mind, to help anxiety, to help with the realisation of an objective, and so on. HOW TO USE THE TIME LINE Climb on top of the time line. Go ahead a bit, after the original event is finished. Go above the event and start teaching. Go before the event. Go above and through the event and let the sensation go, maintaining the teaching. Return to the present, letting go of all the sensations of successive events. Control and pace the future (go into the future maintaining this state of mind). Return to the present. The subject feels great!!!!! To maintain learning and to ensure long-term results, the following questions can also be asked: What does all this teach you?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP and its various techniques offer practical tools for individuals to make positive changes in their lives, without the need to dig into their past. Time Line Extraction, Phobia Techniques, Anxiety Techniques, and R.E.I. are just a few examples of how NLP can be used to achieve internal re-harmonizing objectives or overcome problems. By taking control of their lives, individuals can become \"possibilists\" and find winning strategies to solve even the toughest problems, all while maintaining freedom, choice, self-control, and mental health."
