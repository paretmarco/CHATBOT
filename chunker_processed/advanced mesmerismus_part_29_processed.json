  "title": "\"What are the techniques for overcoming fears, understanding self-identification, and exploring hermeticism and quantum physics in hypnotherapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we will discuss various techniques and exercises related to hypnosis and self-improvement. Before that, we explored the concept of identifications and how they affect our personalities and behaviors. We also looked at the Enneagram and symbols in hermeticism and quantum physics. We delved into various techniques such as gypsy self-hypnosis, Campanelli method, and Di Pisa method to deal with specific issues such as smoking, allergy, and burnout. Finally, we will learn Indian self-hypnosis to realize our desires and connect with the universe. These exercises and techniques will enable us to better understand and control our thoughts and behaviors.",

Head, Breast (the heart), Belly. Hermetically we touch the three main zone. At the end we go a moment in our third eye that is as a zero point (in quantum physics the 0 point is a point that nervertheless contains an incredible energy METHOD 1 - see what you desire in front of you 2 - send an emotion from your earth into the scene 3 - connect the scene to your nombril 4 - begin some \"power breathing\" 5 - look at your third eye 6 - blow your desire into the universe",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by incorporating the clairvoyance exercise before the Indian Self-hypnosis exercise, we can increase our sensitivity and potentially achieve better results. Practicing clairvoyance in pairs in front of a mirror can help access our inner sense, while Indian Self-hypnosis can aid in realizing our desires in the universe by touching on the three main zones of our body and reaching a zero point through power breathing techniques. With dedication and practice, these exercises can deepen our spiritual practice and connection to the universe."
