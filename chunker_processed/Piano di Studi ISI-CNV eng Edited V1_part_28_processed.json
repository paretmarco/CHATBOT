  "title": "What is the course about hypnosis and quantum thinking, and how does it relate to coaching and magnetic techniques?",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes a course that combines hypnosis, NLP-3, and quantum concepts with personal and professional development. The course includes a certification as a Hypnotic Coach and Advanced Hypnotherapist and Mesmerist. The course aims to teach students how to stimulate the base requirements of the individual, bringing the subject to considerable depth of trance. The course content includes non-verbal communication, Enneagram, and NLP-3 framework. The second part of the course focuses on techniques and hypnotic application. The course also includes the unique and powerful paradigm of Quantum Extreme® and the Magnetic Massage technique. The text explains the usefulness of light and the Universe's whole, and introduces the courses in Hypnosis Essential and Hypnotic Practice.",
  "content": "DURATION Two days of workshops First day: - States of consciousness and phenomena of trance - Anesthesia - Profound analgesia - Coaching Professional Hypnosis regressive Second day: - Examples of inductions (Erickson, oriental, elman) - Regressions dissociated - Quantum methodologies - LuxMind method for setting objectives - Hypnotherapy essential In the future we will also activate the courses: Hypnosis essential and “hypnotic Practice”. Now these arguments are developed inside the Hypnotic coaching above. Quantum Coaching Quantum coaching uses the system of luxmind inside a coaching paradigm to help a person to be him/herself and develop his/her potentials A quantum coach is a coach that develops creativity in his coachee and solves problems with creativity. Genius and creativity have an origin, and this origin is not in a logical sequence of steps: it is a quantum paradigm. Creativity can not be developed by a machine: The creativity comes normally in seconds, from deep areas of our mind. There is a reason for this: we can not be totally aware of the processes that lead to creativity, otherwise we would block it with our logic. Our Quantum Psi technology applied to coaching is able to effectively treat the behaviors \"quantum\" that is, the manifestations of the mind resulting from processes that are normally completely unconscious. These are processes that can never become conscious without being distorted. As long as a process is in fact our unconscious the brain work more effectively because it can use the quantum mode, following several lines of reasoning at the same time and creating mental associations.",
