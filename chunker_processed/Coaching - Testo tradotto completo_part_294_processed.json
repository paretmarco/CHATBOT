  "title": "\"How can we tap into the power of our deepest mind through taste, pre-visualization, and presentification?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, we explore the concept of \"taste\" and its connection to the deepest level of the mind. The author explains that, much like an animal heading towards food, we can be more effective in achieving our goals when we possess a direct sensory perception of the \"taste\" of what we want to attain. This primal activity is linked to the cerebellum and is observable through non-verbal communication, such as an increase in saliva or other mouth activity. Mentors are encouraged to pay attention to this phenomenon in their apprentices, as it can indicate a deeper level of engagement. The techniques presented aim to help readers fully experience the taste and wonder of life.",
  "content": "Taste corresponds to the activity of the deepest mind We deliberately use the word “taste”, because, from a neurological point of view, the activity we are trying to describe here is linked to the primary activity of the cerebellum, which represents the most primitive part of the mind. It consists in nothing other than the externalization at a higher level of a primal motion. You can understand the extent of the veracity of what we have just stated even by observing non-verbal communication. When something truly involves our persons, one can notice an increase in salivation or in any event an increment in some activity which takes place at the level of the mouth. If you are a mentor, pay heed to such phenomenon in your apprentice. You can alternatively observe it in your own selves! If, while you are busy imagining something, you notice an olfactory signal (which symbolizes interest) or a gustatory one, you can rest assured that you have delved into the deepest areas of the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and tapping into our primal urges can help us persuade and motivate ourselves and others towards premeditated actions. By engaging our taste buds, as a neurological link to the primitive part of our mind, we can use presentification and multiplication techniques to create and live out our premeditated ideas with greater success. As mentors, we can pay attention to non-verbal communication to identify and encourage these gustatory and olfactory signals in ourselves and others."
