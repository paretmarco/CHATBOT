  "title": "How does breaking the bondage of habits lead to true freedom in life?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author emphasizes the damaging effects of being trapped in social conventions and habits. They argue that modern man is enslaved to a social mechanism that dictates their career, political affiliation, and even their behavior. The author believes that breaking free from these constraints is necessary for true freedom and happiness. Remaining in habitual behavior leads to a circumscribed life that fails to truly engage with the world. The author encourages readers to break the bondage of habit and live life to the fullest.",
  "content": "He is forever enjoined to carry a mask, armed with a stereotyped grin of either authority or submission. Social man is hypnotized, and a slave of conventions: He is subservient to habits. Being trapped in habits is something which obstructs happiness, not just because it lacks harmony, but because it prevents us from developing all our power and literally swallows our reality. Breaking the bondage of habit is the first step we need in order to win our own freedom, and to be clear-sighted as well as far-sighted in life. There are men who live purely by habit: If you examine them for a while, you will come to realize that they are beings whose world is circumscribed to the corner of a most tiny corner, to a bunch of hothouse flowers which, as soon as they stretch their heads out of the glass window, fall down lifeless, destroyed by the robust gust of freedom. So long as you do not break your self-confinement to habits, you will discover at the end of your life that you only watched the world from the window, without having actually lived life. That is true with regard to both the physical and the spiritual realms. Habit is born in an instant.",
  "last_phrase": "To truly live life and unleash our full potential, we must break the bondage of habit and subservience to conventions. As unique individuals with our own gifts and thoughts, we should strive to exit the limiting boundaries and be clear-sighted and far-sighted in life. Only then can we experience true development and not just watch the world go by from the window of habit."
