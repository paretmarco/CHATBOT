  "title": "What is the difference between a teacher and a hypnotic master, and what is the importance of recognizing that difference in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This section delves into the concept of being a true teacher in Quantum Psychology, contrasting it with the subjective experience of being a TEACHER. The author illustrates this difference and warns of the dangers of counter-trance-ference which can arise when teachers see themselves as the ultimate answer to their students' problems. Prior to this, the author discusses different forms of trance-ference in ego psychology, including idealization and spiritualization.",
  "content": "But, on the other hand, if a therapist, teacher or guru belieyes they have the ultimate answer to your problems, or the answer to' how to be in life if only you follow their example and do it their way, this is disempowering and counter-trance-ference. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If you subjectively see and experience yourself as a TEACHER, than you are probably in trance--Terence/ counter-trance-ference and being mom/dad and making or allowing the students/clients to act as children. This principle does not preclude the fact that many people have some- thing to share and teach which is valuable. However, there's a differ- BEYOND IDEALIZATION Most ego psychologists acknowledge the trance-ference of merger, twinship, mirroring and idealization. Idealization, as we all know, occurs when we idealize people, making them more than human so that as children we feel extra safe, more comfortable, and less threatened. This can be seen when young boys say things like, \"My father can beat up your father,\" (4r \"My mom's better than your mom.\" Ego psychology suggests, but does not go further into, the next level of trance-ference which Quantum Psychology calls spiritualization.",
  "last_phrase": "Avoid getting trapped by the god or guru trance in your quest for guidance and spiritual enlightenment. As much as you can learn from your therapist, teacher, or guru, always remember that blindly following them is counter-trance-ference and disempowering. Instead, cultivate a healthy skepticism and introspection, and be critical of the way you idealize the people who have something to teach."
