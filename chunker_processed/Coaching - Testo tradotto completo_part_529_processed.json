  "title": "\"What is the Use of Trading Systems in Achieving Financial Goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explores the importance of using experiences as resources towards our objectives. He questions the value of technical analysis and market tools when market decisions are influenced by changing moods. The author suggests an automatic trading system, but acknowledges that even such a system has limitations. In this final part, the author delves deeper into the concept of an automatic system, its limitations, and the possibility of using it as a long-term solution.",
  "content": "In this case, too, the question arose: “What can I possibly do to learn how to build a trading system and use it in an automatic fashion when operating in the market?” It sounds like a utopia, and yet a method of building one such system truly exists. It does last for a short while, though. The truth is that, had an automatic system capable of always reaping gains, regardless of the direction taken by the market, truly existed, sooner or later every trader would start using it. The bottom line is that systems work for a period only, after which they cease to work.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it may seem like a utopia to have a trading system that reaps gains consistently regardless of the market's direction, the truth is that no such system exists forever. As traders, it's important to understand that money is just a resource, and ultimately, we must use our knowledge and experience to achieve our true desires and goals."
