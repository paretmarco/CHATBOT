  "title": "What is presentification and mental multiplication of an idea and how can they help achieve goals?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of presentification and how it can be used to create a vivid ideational image of our future selves. The author emphasizes the need to visualize and materialize this image in order to project our desires and so fulfill our commitments. The last 200 tokens delve into practical ways of achieving this, including taking the time to reflect on potential obstacles and enduring any discomfort as a natural part of the process. Through this, the author argues, we can create a sense of satisfaction and happiness in our daily lives.",
  "content": "We might thus define presentification as follows: Presentification is the commitment to carry out beforehand whatever might have been laid bare through the process of pre-ideation. Fulfilling such commitment will occasion in us a feeling of satisfaction. Thus stirred into motion by this resolute conviction, we will be unable to anticipate the coming day as being other than a day of happiness. If any particular thing demanding perseverance or reiterated effort, or the endurance of pain on our part, is going to infiltrate tomorrowâ€™s activity, we should take care not to eschew the need of halting by it with our thought. We should take the opposite path of pondering and reflecting at length on such supervening matter. Through that pensive introspection, we will be forced to take into account the ineluctable nature of its occurrence, exactly as would be done by a person on the verge of removing a heavy stone which obstructs his path. That way, when fatigue eventually sets in, it will not be perceived by us as some kind of discouraging intruder, but rather as a natural thing, in the same way that a fisherman becomes inured to having damp feet and does not even bother giving any thought to such habitual reality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by committing to presentification and embracing the inevitability of perseverance and endurance, we can approach each day with a resolute conviction that success is attainable. Through the mental multiplication and absorption of our ideas, we can bring our intended goals to fruition and find satisfaction in our achievements."
