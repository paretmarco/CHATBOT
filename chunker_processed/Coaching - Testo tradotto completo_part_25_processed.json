  "title": "How can we increase our mental energy and vitality to enjoy life's opportunities?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author explored the idea that avoiding dispersion of mental energy and channelling it in the right direction can help us expand our range of active actions, giving us the ability to enjoy opportunities life supplies us with. Now, the author deepens this idea by discussing the key to success, which is to link together reason and intuition, and alternate activity and rest. By doing so, we create a rhythm of oscillation and a coordinated manner of being that will allow us to develop a surplus potential of vital energy, giving us the capacity to venture into new directions.",
  "content": "On the basis of the aforesaid, two distinct ways of creating such synergy arise: The rhythm of oscillation, as a result of which greater power is brought about by alternating activities and methods of action that act on different parts of the brain; The power of wedding these varied energies, This ensures that even greater power materializes in the scenario where the whole of our being acts simultaneously in a coordinated manner. This principle of alternation and conjunction of diverse energies is one of the keys to success. We are enjoined to link together reason and intuition, and alternate activity and rest. Such a “dual dimension” is strictly connected with the development of all our energies. Vitality, too, depends on a rhythm of oscillation. It depends, that is, on the establishment of a balance between the voluntary and the involuntary systems, between the conscious and the unconscious. Developing a surplus potential If we own surplus capital, we can then invest it. The same holds true of vital energy. The more we develop energy, the greater our capacity to venture into new directions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve success and develop a surplus of energy, it is important to establish a rhythm of oscillation and balance between diverse energies, as well as linking reason and intuition, and alternating activity and rest. By doing so, we can increase our capacity to venture into new directions and experience true vitality, which is a surplus of nervous tension and mental strength. To achieve this, we need to prioritize our well-being and invest time and effort into developing our energy levels and overall health."
