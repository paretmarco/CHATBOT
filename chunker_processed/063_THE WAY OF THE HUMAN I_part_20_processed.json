  "title": "How can developing multi-dimensional awareness help us discover our true nature as humans?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author emphasized that we need to acknowledge and appreciate all dimensions of being human, including our animal nature, and not try to reprogram ourselves to be more like ESSENCE. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the essential qualities of our ESSENCE, which include unconditional love, but cautions against trying to use ESSENCE to overcome other dimensions of our nature. The author argues that all dimensions have their function and should be allowed to work according to their nature. Multi-Dimensional Awareness, which involves being aware of all dimensions of being human, is the way to discover WHO YOU ARE.",
  "content": "In other words, to be fully human means to be aware of the external world while being aware of our animal nature with its sexual desires, etc., our thinking and emotional dimensions with its pain and pleasure, ESSENCE with its qualities of love, peace, etc., the I AM, the COLLECTIVE, and the \"NOT-I-I\". This is the development of Multi-Dimensional Awareness, which is the Way of the Human, and which might or may hopefully aid in the discovery of WHO YOU ARE. Quantum physics has shown us beautifully that everything is made of the same substance. With this knowledge, how could anything be inherently bad, something to be gotten rid of, or something which can lead us away from our true nature? We must therefore appreciate all of the dimensions of being human with the understanding that each dimension has a function, and allow each dimension to work according to its nature. This means not substituting or trying to overcome one dimension, like using ESSENCE to overcome the emotional dimension, or the thinking dimension to overcome the biological dimension.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the Way of the Human involves developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness, which requires appreciating and allowing all dimensions of being human to function without resistance. By doing so, we can discover our true nature and the essence of who we are. This functional awareness allows us to place awareness on any dimension, all dimensions simultaneously, or no dimensions, leading us to a state of being where awareness disappears into the void."
