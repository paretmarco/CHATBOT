  "title": "What is the Quantum Magnetism technology and how can it lead to deep personal growth and development?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text focuses on the third and final step of the Quantum Magnetism technology for personal development. At level three, the participant is ready to learn techniques for complete transformation, leading to a higher state of consciousness. This step, known as enhancing the sulphur, cannot be understood without completing the previous two levels. The text also highlights the importance of personalized learning and a holistic approach to human development. The program offers certification in various fields, including NLP, hypnotism and coaching. The academic consortium Cairn recognizes credits for the program and offers a doctorate in Nepal.",
  "content": "In this level we understand that we are part of the same universe we are observing. This awareness must be a daily awareness, not just a glimpse. Step 3 â€“ enhancing the inner fire. At level 3, the participant is now ready to learn the techniques directed towards the center of himself, in a direction that is the complete transformation of the individual. This is climbing the ladder of personal development beyond even the meaning of these words. We go in touch with a superior state of reality and consciousness. The ancient called this step enhancing the sulphur, as sulphur contains in itself the root of fire. The techniques of this level cannot be exposed to words as they require the knowledge of the earlier steps to be understood. These three steps and their succession comes from a centuries old tradition, whose goal is bringing back man to himself. ACADEMIC MASTER RESEARCH PROJECT Our work will have a bigger value, if done in contact with the reality and part of a bigger project. The trainee can realize and have all his studies become a recognized part of a Personal Master Research and Development Project. People wanting to do the Master Research Project are the people that in the future will most spread these techniques. CAIRN is an academic consortium and ISI-CNV is part of it. It will recognize credits to this project and give a doctorate or a recognition. This doctorate is based in Nepal. Cairn has a list of about 30 professors that can try to endorse it in different countries, but we cannot guarantee it always.",
  "last_phrase": "Through the courses offered by the International Network for Knowledge Euro-Asian Academic Network Research, participants can enhance their inner fire and climb the ladder of personal development towards a higher state of reality and consciousness. These courses, which include Magnetism, Fascination, and Quantum Presence, are based on centuries-old traditions and can lead to the development of a new central principle and a unified self-awareness. Participants can also become operators of unique and powerful therapies, such as magnetic massage and Luxmind and Quantum Psi technologies. With recognition from academic consortium CAIRN, these courses offer practical and valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth."
