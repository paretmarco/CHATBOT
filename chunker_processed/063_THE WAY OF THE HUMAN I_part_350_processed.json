  "title": "What is Counter-Transference and Its Impact on Relationships and Therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this article on Quantum Psychology, the author explains the concept of counter-trance-ference in therapy. They state that therapists who age-regress and become the child or parent when a couple approaches divorce reinforce clients' dependency issues and their own trance-ference and counter-trance-ference issues. The author expands on the traditional definition of counter-transference and provides real-life examples of therapists not respecting their clients' desire for independence. They argue against the belief that therapists can re-parent clients to provide corrective experiences, citing two main reasons why it is not possible.",
  "content": "For example, many clients and friends tell me that when they decided they wanted to leave (separate) from a therapist or a teacher, they (the therapists or teachers) began to lecture them, scold them, and put them down for asserting their independence. This is also what parents do when teenagers want to leave home and become independent. In ego psychology, there is a belief that by using trance-ference, the therapist can re-parent the client into health or provide the corrective experience Quantum Psychology says, \"Any therapist or teacher who believes that you can be the 'good enough' parent in present time and re-parent or provide the corrective experience for a client or student by guiding them through developmental phases into health has counter-trance-ference issues.\" Why? For two reasons: One, the therapist or teacher is being the \"good enough\" parent for a price. Secondly, what happened happened, and to imagine that a 1995 therapist can be a parent and \"put in\" in 1995 what was left out in 1955 is both magical and grandiose thinking on the part of the therapist or teacher.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, it is important to acknowledge that therapists, teachers, and parents may struggle with counter-tranceference, which can hinder their ability to truly provide corrective experiences for their clients or children. It is crucial to recognize and address these issues in order to better serve those who seek their guidance and support."
