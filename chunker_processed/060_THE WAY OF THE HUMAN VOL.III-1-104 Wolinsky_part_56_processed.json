  "first_phrase": "In this final part, Debra and Wolinsky delve into her narcissism and the motivation behind why she becomes someone's reflection. Debra expresses feeling hurt that John is not her reflection anymore, and Wolinsky changes the language to explore the reasoning behind becoming John's reflection. Debra reveals that she became John's reflection so that he would love her, and Wolinsky encourages her to connect with her emotions and past experiences. Debra makes a statement to her mother, acknowledging the loneliness she felt growing up and the creation of her own philosophy to cope.",
  "content": "What are you feeling now? John, I became your reflection so that you would be interested in me. John, I became your reflection so that you would not push me away so you would think I was lovable. ________________ A little sad. And also feeling kind of separate from it.

Where in your body do Wolinsky:Say that again.you feel that shakiness? Debra:John, I became your reflection so that you would love me. 5253 Can you have an image of morn over there (on the other side of the room) and make a statement to your mother, \"Since I couldn't connect to you because you weren't around, I cling to this philosophy. \"Since I couldn't connect with you mom and dad, I had to create my own philosophy to hold on to.\" It makes a lot of sense. - How about, \"Since I couldn't get you to reflect me, I created this philosophy.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, reflecting on past experiences and creating personal philosophies can serve as coping mechanisms in the absence of necessary connections. However, actively seeking reflection from others can greatly benefit one's emotional well-being and sense of self-worth."
