  "title": "What is the \"Projection into the Future\" and how does it affect a trader's mindset in trading?",
  "first_phrase": "In this piece, the writer delves into the concept of \"projection into the future\" and its effects on traders. They explore how traders construct fantasies to metabolize losses by accepting them and the link between temporal progression and hypnosis. The article describes how traders immerse themselves in a continuous temporal progression by discerning an imaginary future, which can lead to postponing losses and exceeding limits set at the start. The last 200 tokens highlight how language can contribute to negative \"self-hypnosis\" as words exercise an influence over us. The writer emphasizes the importance of accepting losses, as stated by Alexander Elder: \"A winner accepts his losses. A loser defers them.”.",
  "content": "Usually, this behaviour ensures that even if a trader with a “projection” of growth of a particular stock “in the future”, when in fact the ruling price of such stock actually decreases, is granted the chance of a way out of such calamitous projection, he remains rooted in it, due to the fact he is convinced that, at some imaginary future, he will score a gain. He is accordingly inclined to trespass the limits he had set for himself at the start. This conduct allures him into a postponement of the losses, the significance of which then increasingly grows in magnitude. Trading is a system in which one sometimes gains and at other times loses. If you are unwilling to accept this simple truth, you will be swept away by the losses you will incur. As stated by Alexander Elder: “A winner accepts his losses. A loser defers them”. The words by which some traders engage in negative self-hypnosis Another important factor is that even the language we use might contribute to our negative “self-hypnosis. Words, in fact, exercise an influence over our beings, and they, too, represent hypnotic elements which we unconsciously apply on our own selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, trading is a system where losses are an inevitable part of the process. However, by accepting losses and avoiding negative self-hypnosis, one can mitigate the impact of these losses. By being mindful of the language we use, and approaching \"difficulties\" as \"situations\", we can better navigate the challenges of the market. Avoiding negative self-talk and accepting losses are crucial for success in this unpredictable system."
