  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author emphasized the power of consciousness in dominating both space and time.

Now, in the last 200 tokens, the reader is introduced to the idea that the world, like people, is composed of five elements, namely, earth, water, air, ether, and mind. In this section, the author offers a practice that demonstrates how consciousness controls the elements of solids and liquids.",

Man concentrates in himself all of the kinds of matter of the world and is in touch with all of the kinds of matter of the world.
