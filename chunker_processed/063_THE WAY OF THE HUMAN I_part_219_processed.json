  "title": "\"What is Biological Realization and How can it be Achieved for Multi-Dimensional Awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section of Chapter VIII of \"The Way of the Human,\" the concept of Biological Realization is explored within the framework of Quantum Psychology principles. The previous text highlights the limitations of beliefs and justifications that occur in thinking, while this section delves into the physical manifestation of our essence: the Biological Core. The Biological Core is identified as the core of our physical being that runs from our cranium to our pelvic floor and helps us maintain alignment with the gravitational pull of the sun and earth. The text concludes with the suggestion that years of focusing on the body can bring about Biological Realization and stabilize the awareness that our bodies are made of the same substance as everything else.",
  "content": "In short, \"our\" psychology and the external world try to get us to overcome the body with the thinking and emotional dimensions. For example, overworking, poor air and water—not to mention the socialization process which thwarts our biology and creates greater dissociation. Simply put, modern day time pressures put more of an emphasis on psychology and force a loss of awareness of the body. However, years of body focus can yield BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION. What is BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION? It is the realization that \"your\" body is made of the same substance as everything else and there is no separate individual body. In order for THAT explosion of awareness—that your body is made of the same substance as everything else—to be stabilized, and not just be an experience that comes and goes, it might be helpful if the BIOLOGICAL CORE were also stabilized. 134 Chapter Viii But what is the BIOLOGICAL CORE? It's the core of your physical being which extends from your cranium to your pelvic floor and which holds the body up. The BIOLOGICAL CORE is a biological awareness and a felt sense. It is the alignment between the gravitational pull of the sun and the earth.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, shifting our focus to the biological realization of our body through stabilizing the biological core can help us overcome external pressures that disconnect us from our physical selves. Quantum Psychology research suggests that the dimension ruling the biological core may be electromagnetic, and it's important to differentiate between our false core and our true essence that resides within our physical being. Through years of body focus, we can achieve a stable and mindful connection to our biological core, leading to a more holistic understanding and awareness of ourselves."
