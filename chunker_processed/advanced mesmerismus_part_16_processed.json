  "title": "How can hypnotherapy techniques such as magnetic voice and hypnodrama be used for therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we will explore some advanced techniques in hypnosis and non-verbal communication. We start with an exercise on presence and how it affects our tone of voice. Then, we introduce a method called hypnodrama, which involves inducing crises and evoking emotional reactions to create a shift in perspective for the client. We also discuss fluidification, which prepares the client for magnetism. Next, we explore working on specific problems by using magnetic points and fluidification. We then discuss the test, which is a way to stimulate unconscious answers. Finally, we introduce the Trabona method and the Modified Akstein method for self-hypnosis.",

Paret that created this method that is very effective METHOD: you will tell to the client that \"everyone has a pendulum inside himself\". Or \"everyone has his own rhytm\". Begin creating movement in your client. Add magnetic passes (you will discover he will have a higher sensitivity) For level two, that is a sort of a self-hypnosis, we will search for a desire we want to work on: 1st we create the oculomotor blockage 2nd thinking to something we desire we see, going through three different desires, which one blocks you more the eyes Level 2 - Modified Akstein Method with non verbal hypnosis USE: For doing a self-hypnosis on yourself HISTORY: Akstein was a researcher that created Terpsichore Trance Therapy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the different levels of moving therapy offer effective techniques for self-hypnosis, weight loss, and allergy treatment. Magnetism, which involves direct communication with the body, can be used to harmonize or stimulate organs, depending on whether the client is hypo or hyperactive. The Campanelli Method can help with stopping smoking, while the Gypsy self-hypnosis exercise aims to eliminate false personalities and identities. Understanding true and derivative symbolism can help tailor the approach to the client's preferences and personality. Finally, the Enneagram provides a useful tool for understanding different personality types. Remember to approach these techniques experimentally and adjust as needed for optimal results."
