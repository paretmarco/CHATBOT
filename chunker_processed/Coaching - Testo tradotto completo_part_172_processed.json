  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus shifts to understanding time and self-orientation. The author highlights the excuse of not having enough time, stating that everyone has the same amount of time every day, and it's about personal energy and organizational skills. The text continues with the importance of mastering oneself, releasing useless thoughts, and being present in the moment. It also mentions factors impacting personal magnetism, such as nurturing eurhythmy, balance, and vitality. The section concludes with the importance of planning one's day beforehand and being conscious of one's actions to achieve the highest level of satisfaction.",
  "content": "What one needs to know, therefore, is not whether he can fulfil his commitment, but whether he can bind himself by it in the first place. The truth, indeed, is that “lacking sufficient time” is a complaint which is voiced in the main by those who do not carry out any work at all. Being able to accomplish something is always dependent on two variables: 1) Our own energy, and 2) our organizational aptitude. What we are going to do Once we have learnt how to attain mastery over our own selves, and having practically assimilated the art of clearing up the field of our activity by removing from it the entire spectrum of useless actions and frantic agitations, thereby eliminating those emotions which pose the risk of blocking us, we must try and understand how to act in time. We must plan our day beforehand, and be conscious of what we do in the course of it, in such a manner that we can extract from it the maximum possible result and the highest possible level of satisfaction.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to extract the maximum possible result and the highest possible level of satisfaction from our daily lives, we must learn to organize our time and ourselves. By accomplishing this, we can gain mastery over our own self and embrace the art of living in consonance with our natural talents. Remember, life is but a single day, so let us strive to make the most of it through practical ideation and organization."
