  "title": "\"How does the inner child influence the development of a healer trance and the responsibility of pain relief?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, the author discusses the idea of healers and their effectiveness in curing someone's pain. The author provides an example of a man who claimed to be a healer, yet the pain always returned because the clients did not take responsibility for their own pain. The text also explores how childhood experiences can shape one's identity and lead to the development of magical thinking, including a desire for someone else to take away their pain. The author emphasizes the need for individuals to be conscious and responsible for their own healing process. Lastly, the section ends with a mention of the author's personal experience attending a Sufi Dancing event in Los Angeles with their friend, David.",
  "content": "It needs to be noted that I am not discounting healers. I am, however, suggesting that for a healing to take place, the person being healed must be conscious, aware, and responsible for their internal experience. If they are not responsible, and not willing to make internal and external changes, the healing will be temporary and will not last. If someone thinks someone else can take their pain, they are in an inner-child identity and will probably be drawn to a healer who is, also, in an age-regressed inner-child identity imag- ining they can take another's pain. In my life, my inner child always chose women who would argue with me. (\"I want a girl, just like the girl who married dear old Dad\"). After years of therapy and six years in a treatment facility (in India called an Ashram), I was aware of the problem and could interrupt the process. Still my inner child was working. One night, my best friend, David took me to watch Sufi Dancing in Los Angeles. About 75 people were there, some watchers, some doers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, healing is a collaborative effort that requires responsibility and awareness from the person being healed. While healers may assist in the process, the individual must be willing to make both internal and external changes, or the healing will be temporary. It is important to acknowledge and interrupt any negative patterns in our lives that may be driven by our inner child, in order to grow and move forward towards positive change."
