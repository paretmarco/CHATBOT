  "title": "\"What is Catastrophizing and Fantasizing in Cognitive Therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the first part of the text, the author explores the concept of futurizing - projecting oneself into the future and imagining a particular outcome. This part delves into two styles of futurizing: catastrophizing and fantasizing. The last 200 tokens describe the case of a woman who imagined herself being taken care of by her partner, but the unrealistic idealization led to frustration. The odd part about futurizing is that one can feel the pain or happiness of the imagined situation even though it is not happening, as it takes place at present time. The concept of the \"inner child\" and past traumas affecting present thoughts and behavior is also discussed.",
  "content": "As mentioned earlier, the complaint of anxiety is imagining a catastrophic outcome and experiencing distress now. This trance of the dark side of the inner child takes place as the child sees trauma in his life. The child assumes that this is how life will always be. As an adult, the child within the adult continually \"pops-up\" catastrophies and thinks they are real. The result is pain and suffering in present time. Here, past catastrophies are projected into the future. 2. Fantasizing In this style of the futurizing trance, the child imagines a pleasant outcome in the future. The pleasant imagined outcome helps protect the child from the distressing, ongoing interactions in the family. For example, a child imagines herself waiting \"for her ship to come in,\" or imagines her talent being \"discovered,\" or fantasizes a time when she will be \"taken care of.\" Problems arise when the child within the adult stays \"stuck\" and continues to imagine the unrealistic idealized future. A woman I once saw for therapy was in a relationship with a man for years and was always frustrated. She wanted him to take care of her.",
  "last_phrase": "To break out of these trances and avoid projecting past catastrophes or unrealistic fantasies into the future, it is important to recognize and address the inner child's experiences and traumas. By understanding and healing the source of the child's distress, the present adult can move forward with a clearer, more positive outlook on reality."
