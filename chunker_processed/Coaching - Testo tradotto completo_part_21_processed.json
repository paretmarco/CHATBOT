  "title": "What is the potential of our essential being and how can we utilize it?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author proposes that our potential is greater than we imagine, and that our true identity can be found within our essential being. The author cites De Musset and Lamartine, who claimed that their creative work was not the result of conscious effort, but rather a manifestation of their true selves. The author also discusses the concept of two minds – one represented by the brain and the other by the enteric brain, located in the nervous plexuses at the level of the navel. The author suggests that centralizing oneself through bodily and general relaxation methods and focusing on the navel can help establish contact with the essential being. In this final section, the author explores the importance of being present to oneself and to time, and suggests that infinite time would reveal the eradication of differences between individuals.",
  "content": "Physiology Our essential being is other than our brain: It consists in the entirety of our being. That is why bodily or general relaxation methodologies are profoundly useful to the purpose of establishing contact with it. Drawing attention to the navel is another way of helping the process of centralizing oneself. In this regard, we might conceive man as having two minds: One mind which is represented by our “enteric brain”, which is situated in the nervous plexuses at the level of the navel, and which is linked to our deepest responses. At the level of our stomach there is in fact a second mind, which is responsible for hereditary reactions, digestion and a large part of physiology. It is no coincidence then, that when we feel an irritation precisely in that area we experience discomfort and stomach ache. Gastritis is frequently connected to an essential inward being which is not sufficiently recognized … C) Consciousness of time and being present to oneself Being present to our own selves and to time. If infinite time was available to us, it might be found that discrepancies between man and man would be erased.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to establish a connection with our essential being, relaxation methodologies and focusing on the navel can be helpful. Our enteric brain, situated at the level of the navel, is linked to our deepest responses and is responsible for essential reactions and physiology. The consciousness we have of time is crucial, and knowing how to use our time and energy well is the magical formula for achieving anything we wish. By being present to ourselves and our time, we can overcome discrepancies and achieve our goals."
