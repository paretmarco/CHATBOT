  "title": "\"What is the connection between controlled emotions, personal magnetism, and abdominal breathing?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, we delve into controlling emotions and developing personal magnetism. The text describes a breathing exercise with six phases aimed at restoring emotional balance and absorbing vital force. The massage produced in the solar plexus area is said to result in a sensation of calm and wellbeing. The text argues that personal magnetism is linked to emotional self-control, and one's impact on others can be felt without conscious awareness.",
  "content": "You should implement this particular exercise 7 times in a row, with the fully clear intention, during the inhaling phase, to absorb a large deal of vital force, and, during the alternative movements, to drive away the ideas produced by your resentful emotion and to re-establish the unsettled nervous balance. The massage which is produced by enveloping the organs of the solar plexus is quite energetic. Soon you will feel a warm heat which originates at the level of the solar plexus and then extends into every direction, thereby spreading around a sensation of calm and wellbeing, without your will needing to intervene at all. The solar plexus is additionally essential to the development of what is termed “personal magnetism”. Controlling Emotions and personal Magnetism What we call “personal magnetism” is a sensation which is profoundly connected to your emotional self-control. Regardless of the scientific justifications of the phenomenon (an effective above-average non-verbal communication, energy and so on), one or more persons who are placed at a short distance from you (up to a maximum of five meters) feel the impact exercised by your person to a greater or a lesser extent: This gets transmitted without you being consciously aware of it.",
  "last_phrase": "To develop personal magnetism, it is crucial to control your emotions. Practice the exercise seven times in a row, and focus on absorbing vital force during inhaling and driving away resentful emotions during alternative movements. The massage produced by enveloping the solar plexus organs is vigorous and helps establish emotional balance. With perfect self-control, you can emit a powerful and harmonious influence on others, but without it, you may experience a continuous loss of magnetism that weakens your personal influence."
