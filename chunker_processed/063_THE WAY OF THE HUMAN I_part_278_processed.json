  "title": "Why Does Denying Our Animal Tendencies Make Us Feel Crazy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the author delves deeper into the concept of false selves and false cores from a Quantum Psychology perspective. Biological needs such as safety, food, and sex are often substituted by societal rewards leading to psychological want. The text talks about how therapists feel it's their job to make others feel safe, which is hard-wired into the nervous system as a part of the Biological False Core of survival. The author concludes by offering a demonstration of how people often develop body tension to gain control when experiencing a loss of control.",
  "content": "That's why money, diplomas, achievement, etc., when substituted for biological needs escalate, ending up with a psychological want which is dissociated from the original biological need. ________________ FALSE CORE: I am not safe. FALSE SELF:I have to make myself safe or create safety for others to feel safe. Another Biological False Core is \"I'm not safe\"; hence you have a False Self Compensator which tries to create safety. Adjuncts to this, \"I feel safe Nvhen others don't feel safe, or \"I am not safe\" and \"They will make me safe.\" There are many therapists who feel it is their job to make others feel safe. This too is hard-wired into the nervous system and is part of the Biological False Core of survival. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Personal psychology is formed to defend against Biological Deprivation order chaos and restore biological equilibrium. THE REPRESSED ANIMAL AND THE FALSE CORE CONCLUSION-FALSE SELF SOLUTION A DEMONSTRATION Wolinsky:When you feel these urges called \"no control,\" what do you do so you don't have to feel them to gain control? Denise:I develop body tension immediately.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding our biological false cores and false selves is crucial for personal growth and development. By recognizing our survival mechanisms and compensatory behaviors, we can learn how to reorganize our nervous system to achieve greater emotional equilibrium and multi-dimensional awareness, allowing us to transform negative impulses into positive actions towards self-improvement."
