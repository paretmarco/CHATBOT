  "title": "How is samadhi different from the desire for dependent unity with a guru or relationship partner?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author explains how an individual stuck in the early trance of wishing to reunite with their mother often mistakes dissociation for spirituality. Johnson's theory of individuation-separation process is also discussed. At this stage, a child experiences a sense of omnipotence and believes in his/her unity with the mother. The toddler wishes to believe in owning his/her motherâ€™s magical powers, but his/her cognitive immaturity protects him/her from realizing his/her separateness and vulnerability. Inappropriate handling of integrating these desires often leads to refusal to accept reality.",

(pp. 25-26) When his need to integrate his desires for independent expression and dependent unity is badly handled and/or when his need for integrating grandiosity and vulnerability is inappropriately dealt with--refusal to accept the rapprochement with reality is often the result.",

While the toddler's cognitive immaturity may protect him from these realities, refusing to accept rapprochement with reality can lead to fixation on grandiosity and dependency. Let us strive for a balanced understanding of ourselves and our place in the world, rather than seeking illusions of absolute control and power."
