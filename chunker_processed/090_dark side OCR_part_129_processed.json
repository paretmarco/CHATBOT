  "title": "\"How can you expand and differentiate your inner experience through questioning your inner child?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text, the focus shifts to taking charge of the experience of fog, clouding, and blanking by making it bigger, different, and varied. The author describes the use of differentiation to vary the structure of the trance and shift it from an automatic response to a conscious, self-generated one. The text also includes two approaches to exploring the inner child and their willingness to see and hear. By asking relevant questions, the inner child's responses can be written down to gain a better understanding of oneself.",
  "content": "In differentiation, notice color, transparency, translucency, and opaqueness. This causes the trance to shift from being one solid mass to a varied experience, with different integrity levels. Approach II: Answer these questions on a separate piece of paper. Keep asking the questions, writing down whatever pops up, until nothing else pops up. 1. Where is the inner child in your body? 2. Ask the inner child, \"What am I willing to see?\" Write down the inner child's answers. 3. Ask the inner child, \"What are you (the inner child) unwilling to see?\" Write down the inner child' s re- sponse. 4. Ask the inner child, \"What are you willing to hear?\" Write down the inner child' s answers. 5. Ask the inner child, \"What are you unwilling to hear?\" Write down the inner child's responses. Approach I11: 1. Ask the inner child, \"What did you (the inner child) decide to see? Write down the inner child' s answers. 2.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by paying attention to the different levels of color, transparency, translucency, and opaqueness, we can enhance our experience of differentiation. By also utilizing the Inner Child approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own psyche and begin to heal past traumas. Remember to ask the Inner Child questions, and write down their responses until nothing else pops up."
