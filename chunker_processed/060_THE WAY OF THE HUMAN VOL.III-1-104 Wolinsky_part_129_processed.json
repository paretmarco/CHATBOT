  "first_phrase": "In the last two hundred tokens of this text, the authors discuss the reflector-reflected mechanism and the role of the observer in it. Fred speaks about his intense desire to merge with the external and the illusion of spiritual growth of accumulating knowledge and merit. They delve into the idea that prior to the infant-observer-reflector mechanism, there is no \"I\" or \"me.\" They explore the idea of consciousness and if it has any relation to the observer-reflector-reflected process. The text reveals that there is no \"me,\" and everything just IS.",
  "content": "127 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Wolinsky:What lie could the observer of the reflector-re- flected process tell the reflector-reflected process, or better yet, is there a \"you\" separate from this or is there no you separate from this. Therapeutic Note Prior to theinfant-observer-reflector-reflector is prior to an \"I\" or a Li me . Fred:There is NO-ME. The image emerges out of the NOTHING and slowly it solidifies. Wolinsky:Does the reflector-reflected process have anything it should not experience? Fred:It's own dissolution. Wolinsky:Why would it not want to experience its own dis- solution. Fred:Because then it would not be. Woiinsky:Do you have an assumption that \"you are?\" Fred:Not at the moment, everything just IS. Chapter HI Fred: Wolinsky: Fred: Wolinsky: No. If you did not associate with the observer-reflector-reflected process at all would there be such a thing as consciousness? No, consciousness is just as an idea. Does this idea of consciousness have something to do with a \"you\" or the observer-reflector-reflected process? Fred:With it. There is NO ME.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of the observer-reflector-reflected process and accepting the ultimate archetype of I AM will allow us to let go of everything else and find our true selves. Holding onto the I AM will eradicate the false self and help us create a separate universe within ourselves, leading to a more fulfilled life."
