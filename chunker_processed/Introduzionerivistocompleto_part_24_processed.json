  "first_phrase": "This text provides insights into effective communication, specifically in nonverbal communication. It explains how people use three channels (visual, auditory, and coenaesthesis) to derive their representational system and how understanding these channels can create better relationships and resolve problems.

  "content": "PART FIVE: PERSON TYPES Obviously, the more we delve into the communication argument, the more we learn about the different methods available for understanding what psychological type we have in front of us. Very useful in this procedure is the ENNEAGRAM. The enneagram in some schools of thought is seen as a tool for spiritual growth, in others, it is seen under a psychological profile. We follow a third idea; unlike the traditional methods, our emphasis falls on communication. For this reason we refer to the “Communicational Enneagram”. ENNEAGRAM “Enneagrams are the geometry of the soul, which reveal our character” (Helen Palmer) Have you ever wanted to know what your interlocutor thinks about? The enneagram is a specific description, concise and precise, of nine personality profiles in which we can all recognize ourselves. It is an excellent tool to help us understand ourselves in a deeper way, to improve our understanding of others, to highlight positive sides in ourselves and in others, to soften negative ones, and to be able to comprehend similarity and dislikes. Apart from this description, the enneagram also identifies personal growth for us: to improve ourselves, develop thoughts, emotions, and unexpressed potentiality. The enneagram originated as a tool in the East, becoming widespread in the West later. The name comes from the Greek word ennea, which means nine and gramma which stands for sign.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enneagram is a powerful tool that can help in both personal and professional spheres. It can aid in developing self-knowledge, improving communication, and understanding the psychology of others. Moreover, it can reveal personal growth opportunities and highlight positive and negative traits for us and those around us. The \"communicational enneagram\" is particularly useful as it emphasizes communication over traditional methods. Hypnosis in NLP is another technique that can be employed to establish efficient communication and alter our mindset towards a more positive direction. In the end, it is up to us to take the initiative and become active participants in our lives rather than passive observers."
