  "title": "What is the relationship between spiritualizing and specialness in defending against chaos and how does it relate to the inner child?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the focus is on the dark side of the inner child and its spiritualizing and specializing effect. The text explains that this is a way for the inner child to defend against chaos and feeling special as a way of coping with being raised in dysfunctional families, often resulting in an adult feeling misunderstood, alienated or unseen. The text mentions the author's own experience of searching for a guru who promised to know the truth and free her from the hidden secret of her incest, but ultimately discovering that the guru did not hold the answers she sought. The concept of \"maya,\" or illusion, in some Asian systems is used to refer to how the secret is spiritualized.",
  "content": "In that way the inner child is compulsively drawn to a guru who claims to know the truth and will, since she is special, impart this secret to her. In my circumstance, it was the truth of my incest that set me free from the trance of spiritualizing. In my case I went to gurus to help me find the secret that was hidden from me, and which the inner child had hidden from me. I had transferred my parents on the guru, who I imagined knew the \"secret\" The guru exhibits counter-trance- ference. He represents the other side of the identity, pretending either he knows the secret of freedom, or claims he is free and, therefore, can unlock the hidden secret within you. Often the guru suggests methods or ways to unlock these secrets of the universe. Here the guru believes he has the way, and the child within the adult trance-fers his parents onto the guru, in hope of finding the way out of the maze of the secret, (i.e. the incest or dysfunction.) The secret is spiritualized, being called \"maya\" (the illusion) in some Asian systems. The Guru did not know the secret of my incest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to be cautious while seeking spiritual guidance from gurus and teachers. Transferring unresolved issues to them and seeking a secret can lead to spiritualized abuse and further harm. Accepting the truth and acknowledging the need for proper healing is truly freeing."
