  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author delves into the concept of spiritualizing and achieving uninterrupted awareness. They highlight the importance of breaking free from the age-regressed world views that inhibit our experience of underlying unity. The author presents quantum consciousness as a natural spirituality that allows us to be separate and interconnected as a choice rather than a mere automatic response. The section concludes with insight into what makes a good client or practitioner in this work. John Lennon's \"I Found Out\" lyrics are used to make a point.",
  "content": "I found this out .... \"I Found Out\" John Lennon 124 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Preamble Before I discuss spiritualizing and its effects, it is important for me to emphasize several points. First, what prevents a true communion with the underlying unity is our automatic trances. Secondly, the intention of this section is to free us all from the past and age-regressed world views, which inhibit our experience of this underlying unity. Third, what we are left with is uninterrupted awareness uninhibited by memory, distortion, resistance to chaos, or in a word, trances. It is with this pure, uninterrupted awareness, without prior automatic trances, that the natural interconnection and unity becomes more available. This natural unity, called \"quantum consciousness\" is what I believe to be a natural spirituality. A spirituality where we are free to be separate and free to feel the interconnection of everything as a choice, rather than automatic separation or automatic fusion, which can be mistaken for unity. While I travel and train individuals in my workshops I am often asked, \"What makes for a good client or practitioner in this style of work?\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we can all benefit from adopting a warrior's attitude towards awareness and confronting the beliefs and trances that inhibit our experience of underlying unity. As John Lennon famously sang, \"I found out\" that this is the path towards true spirituality and quantum consciousness, where we are free to choose the interconnection of everything rather than automatic separation or fusion."
