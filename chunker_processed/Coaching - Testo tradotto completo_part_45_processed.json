  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text focuses on the importance of establishing a connection with oneself to achieve success and satisfaction in life. The author explains that luck is not a random event but is born out of our own thoughts, reactions, and feelings. The text suggests that to realize the aims and ideals that bring us joy, we must connect with our profound individualized essence, our essential being. This being is identified with the balance between a person's different parts and the surrounding Universe, and it is the origin of a truer and more effective way of being. The author emphasizes the significance of this essential being and how it differs from the impulsive modes of reasoning that define the \"self.\"",
  "content": "This essential being might be physiologically identified with the balance between a person’s different parts and the surrounding Universe, that is, with the profound harmony which is embedded at the centre of our own selves 7. As it is located above all the various mental superstructures, it might be the origin of a new, truer and more effective way of being.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and connecting with our essential being can lead to a deeper sense of harmony and unity within ourselves and with the Universe. By recognizing the difference between our primary and harmonious being and our individualistic ego, we can navigate life with a clearer sense of direction and purpose. While our ego may serve us in adapting to our surroundings, it is important to remember that it is merely a superficial layer and not the true essence of who we are."
