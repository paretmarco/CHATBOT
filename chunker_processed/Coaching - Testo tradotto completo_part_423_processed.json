  "title": "\"What is the Coherence Field and How Does it Impact Our Presence and Relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the importance of developing presence in action through exercises such as \"distance attention.\" Now, we delve into the concept of \"Coherence Field\" in the applied science of presencing and fascination. This field is created by the coherence between our thoughts, perception of external reality and actions. By increasing our presence, we create a denser coherence field, which allows us to assimilate others into our energy field. This phenomenon emerges from the more reptilian area of the brain and is illustrated in the arena of seduction. It is essential to avoid falling into the other person's game and to \"thicken\" one's presence.",
  "content": "He is disabled from controlling any thing any longer, since every thing is being controlled by us. We are accordingly facing a very reptilian phenomenon, something emerging, that is, from the more reptilian area of the brain. We might in fact conceive reptiles, the most primitive animals, as being marked by a different attention towards the world around them. An illustrating example of where a coherence field operates is the arena of seduction. Many people feel \"carried\" towards another person by something bigger than themselves. In actual fact, the one that falls in love is some being of ours which is vaster than our mere conscious self. We cannot talk, in the case of seduction, of some grounding decision, even though, in some instances, a person might desire to attain a specific thing. If we fail to get where we aimed to be, it means that our coherence field was not sufficiently strong 109. It is important not to fall inside the other person's game, and to â€œthicken\", which is a term we use in order to refer to increasing one's presence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the power of coherence fields can lead us towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. By thickening our presence and avoiding being caught in the games of others, we can tap into a vaster being within us that can guide us towards our desired goals. Remember that the human being is subtle and going past the surface can unlock immense potential in ourselves and our relationships."
