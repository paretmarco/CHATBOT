  "title": "\"How can traders develop intuitive acumen and optimize their unconscious mind for effective trading?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author discusses the development of the ability to be \"unconsciously competent\" in trading, which is built upon the prior phases of analysis and skill development. The added element at this stage is intuitive acumen, which allows traders to create a tailor-made trading system and operate effectively in an unconscious manner. However, it is important to maintain a position of \"not knowing\" and avoid falling prey to expectations about the market. The author highlights the use of subjective beliefs and convictions in communication about the market, and the importance of avoiding cognitive biases.",
  "content": "We often observe that the same page of a financial newspaper includes, side-by-side, two different articles devoted to technical analysis, one of which uses a strategy or puts forward a viewpoint that is being advanced by those who see the market long (bullish), and the other typical of those who see it short (bearish). Traders are in the habit of employing such verbalizations as: “The market is due for a rise; it must first ensure; it must continue to; sooner or later it will have to; it just cannot go on like this, etc”. This happens when one establishes a connection with the market which is grounded on one point of view only, whereupon, on the strength of his subjective beliefs and convictions, he communicate with other people, and often even with his own self, by making use of the abovementioned vocabulary.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve success in the market, it is essential to broaden our outlook and gather diverse data and viewpoints. By doing so, we can develop a well-formed quantum register and attain the intuitions needed to succeed. Through self-hypnosis, we can inform our mind of our goal and allow our unconscious mind to guide us towards the most effective methods. The key to success lies in moving beyond our rational thinking and tapping into the limitless power of our unconscious mind."
