  "title": "How does quantum psychology relate to the mind-body continuum and the concept of soul?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the concept of the holographic human continuum is introduced. The continuum ranges from the solid bones to emotions and thoughts, where all aspects of the body are interconnected in a holographic whole. The principle of quantum psychology emphasizes the need to meet problems at the level of the problem, and no one system can do it all. The author emphasizes the importance of utilizing appropriate tools for appropriate problems. Additionally, the controversial concept of the spirit/soul separate from the body is discussed, which is the core of most religions.",
  "content": "THE HOLOGRAPHIC HUMAN: THE CONTINUUM To understand the continuum, compare the most solid thing in the body--our bones—to the less solid muscles, the less solid organs, the less solid emotions and thoughts. When we understand the holographic human continuum, Korzybski's organism-as-a-whole gives us a different view of the body/mind and its structure. 123 The Way of the Human 0 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness This holographic continuum could be illustrated thus: B ones—muscles--).organs—oblood—sensations—*emotions—othoughts (or vice-versa), all in one interconnected holographic whole. THE SPIRIT/SOUL IS THE BODY One of the most controversial—and, probably, one of the most crucial concepts to discuss is the assumption that there is a spirit or soul which is separate from the body. This idea is at the core of almost all religions. Hindus, for example, think of a soul, which incarnates again and again. Christians, although they do not think in terms of past lives, do talk of a future life for this soul or spirit in Heaven, if you're good, and Hell if you're bad.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the holographic human continuum and embracing the idea that the spirit/soul is the body can lead to a different perspective on the body/mind's structure and provide a valuable framework for developing multi-dimensional awareness in our lives."
