  "title": "How does the external context affect our relationships and awareness in the present moment?",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter V of \"The Way of the Human: Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness,\" the author explores how our relationships with the external world often begin with different contexts surrounding us. The text emphasizes how various external circumstances can trigger our unresolved internal issues. The author provides two exercises to improve our awareness of the external world and how it affects us. The text cautions against negating the external and believing that we can control it entirely through our thoughts and beliefs.",
  "content": "Soon you meet someone and it gets sexual. All of a sudden your psychological and emotional issues begin to come up. Why? Different externals pull up different unresolved internals. EXERCISES FOR THE FIRST DIMENSION OF AWARENESS THE EXTERNAL WORLD Exercise #1 Step I: Eyes open. Slowly look around the room at people and objects. Notice the memories, internal voices, and associations which automatically \"pop up\" for you. Exercise #2 Step I: Now without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, as- sociations or perceptions, look around the room. 71 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Step II: Notice the difference in your experience between Exercise #1 and Exercise #2. Practice: Take some time to explore for a few hours a day being with people in your life \"without using your memory, mind, associations or perceptions.\" THE EXTERNAL DOMINATES The external is dominant. People in the healing arts and in the New Age sometimes negate the external. They \"believe\" (thinking dimension) that they can master or control the external through their internal thoughts, beliefs, or images (see thinking dimension).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the external dominance and its impact on our internal world is crucial for personal development. By practicing exercises such as observing without associations, we can become more aware of our unresolved issues and work towards processing them to improve our overall well-being. Remember that the external context can trigger our uncooked seeds, but by gaining multi-dimensional awareness, we can navigate these experiences with more ease and understanding."
