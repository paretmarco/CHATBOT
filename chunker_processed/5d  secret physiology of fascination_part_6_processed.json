  "title": "\"How does peripheral vision affect our perception of sound and surroundings?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we examined the Mandelbaum Effect, which explains that the operator's voice seems to come from a different location as they move farther away from the subject. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the process of entering the subject's microcosm, which involves extreme convergence and accommodation of the ocular axes. This causes the subject to be almost blind to the external world while fixating their attention on a specific point. Peripheral circular movements tend to excite our mind in a specific way and can prepare us for real fascination work. Furthermore, the author explores how our brain processes central and peripheral vision subconsciously, sifting through information for our conscious mind.",
  "content": "FIXATION OF ATTENTION and Blurring As we walk, drive a car , or fly low over the terrain , our accommodation is determined largely by Gibson's (1950) well-known \"texture gradient.\" The retin a unconsciously performs some kind of a product-moment averaging routine on the textural elements t o reduce the blur, and the fact that much of the scene necessarily remains blurred normally goes unnoticed so long as the acuity demand remains low. But as we point in a specific direction blurring appears in the peripheral field CIRCULATION AND EXPANSION IN THE UNIVERSE Peripheral Circular Movements Circular movements seem to have a specific exciting effect on the eyes. They can prepare the real fascination work. It is to observe that the sense of rotation matters and as we do a circular movement we tend to excite our mind in a specific way EXCITING THE UNCONSCIOUS Central and Peripheral Vision If you divide our brain into the conscious and subconscious, you could say that cone (central) vision is processed consciously, whereas rod (peripheral) vision is processed subconsciously. At most times, your subconscious mind functions in the background, sifting through huge streams of information for your conscious mind to consider.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding the connection between fixation of attention, peripheral vision, and blurring, one can enhance their visual experience and improve their ability to observe the world around them. Utilizing circular movements and paying attention to both focal and ambient vision can help to stimulate the subconscious mind and increase visual acuity, ultimately leading to a more alert and engaged state of being."
