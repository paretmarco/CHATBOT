  "title": "How is dissociation used as a spiritual practice and how does it affect one's ability to observe and experience emotions?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the danger of using meditation or spirituality as a means of disconnection or medication. The previous section talks about disconnection and dissociation as a way of protecting the child during traumatic experiences. This last section delves into the Am Not My Body Trance, where individuals disassociate themselves from certain body parts or functions due to external influences. Robin Williams' infamous naming of his penis as \"Mr. Happy\" serves as an example. The text warns against using spirituality as a means of escaping one's emotions or not owning one's experiences.",
  "content": "The person goes into a dissociative trance and thinks its meditation because they feel peaceful and calm. In reality, however, this dissociative trance hides the trauma. The strategy of the observer creating dissociative trances to protect the child appears, like meditation, but is only a combination of amnesia and numbing-out called dissociation. I had a psychiatrist friend, who, because he couldn't feel, imagined he was spiritual. He developed anorexia (not eating) and called it \"fasting.\" As this escalated, he began using enemas under the spiritual label of \"purification.\" The disconnection of the inner child within the adult can become so strong that in order not to feel, any means is adopted, even meditation or using spirituality as medication. (See Chapter 14, Spiritualization) 3. / Am Not My Body Trance: A particular body part, due to parental or family suggestions, may be experienced as \"not me.\" For example, frequently in this culture, both men and women are forced to dis-connect from sexual feelings. Men often give their penis a name, as if it has a life of its own. Comedian Robin Williams calls his penis \"Mr. Happy.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to acknowledge that dissociative trances can be mistaken for meditation or spirituality, but in reality, it is a temporary coping mechanism to hide deep trauma. It is crucial for adults to identify and address these disconnections that may have stemmed from childhood experiences, particularly in cases of sexual disconnections, to prevent future relationship problems and suffering. It is never too late to seek healing and regain control over one's body and mind."
