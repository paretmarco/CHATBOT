  "first_phrase": "In this text, Dr. Wolinsky facilitates a therapeutic session with Jill where she explores the concept of emptiness and essence. Jill distinguishes between her body-mind and her essence, which she experiences as infinite. Wolinsky then guides her through a process of intentionally concluding that she is alone and noticing the resulting feelings. As a result, Jill experiences a loving presence, which is complete, whole, and never-ending.",
  "content": "from (ESSENCE-I AM, NOT-I-I, etc.). Next, we are now going to trace the steps backward explicitly having her do them knowingly with awareness. For example, first she decided the empty space means alone. Next she decided this is who she is. Jill:Jill is finite, but I go on forever. That is it. Wolinsky:Now, notice this spaciousness and now conclude that this experience means I am empty, I am alone. Now, decide that this is who I am. How are you feeling now? Jill:Well, I feel very separate, I feel very defined, I feel very distinct and very alone and very scared and frozen. Wolinsky:So go into that experience now and then inten- tionally conclude that means you are alone and notice all the feelings that occur when you con- clude that this experience means that you are alone. The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Jill:Yeah, it's like a loving presence. I'm using that word again but there's like a presence,'a fullness, a richness, a wholeness, a vastness, a completeness, an expansiveness, never endingness. It just is.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by tracing the steps backward and intentionally concluding that being alone is a part of who you are, you can move beyond the False Core and tap into your Essential Core. This exercise can help you experience a sense of wholeness and vastness that goes beyond limitations and fears."
