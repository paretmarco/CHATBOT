Purpose and Summary of our Method of Magnetic Success Our method is founded on four successive phases: 1. Achieving control over our own selves as well as our vital force. Eliminating those useless and dispersive activities which originate, not in our clear choice, but rather in the ghosts of our subconscious, in vacuous desires, and in the predilection for basking in convenient situations. Doing this will simultaneously occasion the development of an increasingly greater personal magnetism. 2.",
