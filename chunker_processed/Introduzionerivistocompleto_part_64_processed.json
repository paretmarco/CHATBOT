  "title": "What are the Epistemological Considerations and New Hypno-Rapport Concept in Progressive Concepts?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is the last part of a more in-depth summary of progressive concepts, epistemological considerations, and the new hypno-rapport concept. It is essentially aimed at those who are already familiar with the subject and want to look further into it. The section covers the works of scientists like P. Watzlawick, J. Weakland, G. Bateson, and M. Erickson. The section also discusses neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) techniques used to improve behavior and personality. It also highlights the importance of building rapport with clients by pacing and leading them. The section concludes with a demonstration of NLP as a multi-level, matching, and leading system.",
  "content": "R. Bandler and J. Grinder, drawing on what they gathered from the modeling of M. Erickson, V. Sartir and F. Perls’ communicative strategies, have always leaned towards all the techniques that allowed the therapist to generate a harmonious rapport, indispensable in activating the change process. For example, M. Erickson had great ability in using EVERYTHING that the client provided, with the aim of generally “pacing” the client’s own “model of the world”. Although Erickson KNEW what he did with his patients, he found it difficult to explain HOW he did it. M. Erickson didn’t “judge” his client; he simply used learning processes, without imposing metaphors, values and beliefs outside of his experience: each intervention dedicated to the elimination of the so called learned limitations was carried out through the activation of the client’s natural learning processes. In NLP, “rapport” means “tuning”: when we pace our interlocutor at various descriptive levels, we allow him/ her to recognize himself/ herself in our communication and, consequently, trust us. NLP can be usefully described as a multi-level, matching and leading system, organized inside a hieratic structure. Climbing up through these levels, we gradually pass from single techniques capable of generating a rapport (chunking down) to more developed, integrated models for personality evaluation: the Enneagram (chunking up). The hypothesis we want to demonstrate is that: We have tried to visually demonstrate this concept by using the schematic presented in the following table (a thank you to Stefano Sessini for the graphic layout).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the communicative strategies developed by R. Bandler and J. Grinder, drawing on the teachings of M. Erickson, V. Satir, and F. Perls, emphasize the importance of creating a harmonious rapport between therapist and client. By \"pacing\" the client's own \"model of the world\", the therapist can effectively activate the client's natural learning processes and eliminate learned limitations. NLP offers a range of techniques and models to help achieve this rapport, from basic descriptive matching to more complex personality evaluations like the Enneagram. Visual depictions like the table presented in this text can be helpful in understanding these concepts."
