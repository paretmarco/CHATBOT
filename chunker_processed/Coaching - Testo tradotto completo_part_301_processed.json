  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text explores the technique of \"multiplication and absorption of the idea\" and its benefits in executing complex operations. It involves multiplying the energy of presentification and letting it be absorbed by the body through the technique of the light. The author suggests verbalizing the presentification and following the luminous trace with the eyes closed to realize how the idea has further permeated the inner core of one's being. Additionally, the text mentions the possibility of combining presentification with personality substitution, allowing individuals to choose the personality they want to have.",
  "content": "The multiplication of the idea by means of the light represents a quantum technique having a close connection with the techniques utilized for the sake of making ourselves magnetic, which techniques are going to be set out in the next chapter. By resorting to such techniques, practical implementation of the idea is multiplied, and we come to appropriate it more as part of our usual assets. Verbalize your presentification. Look now at the light, and repeat such verbalization as you do so. Close your eyes. Follow the luminous trace with your sight. When time comes to reopen your eyes, you will realize how your own idea has further permeated the inner core of your being, how it has turned into something which now pervades you. Substitution of personality It is also possible to combine presentification with personality substitution, and go even as far as anticipating an action as one which is carried out by some other people. Our self, in fact, what we term “our personality”, is in actual truth a blend devoid of any permanent value, and one which changes by its self every single moment. We are able a fortiori to resolve on choosing for ourselves the personality we want to have.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by utilizing the quantum technique of multiplying our idea through light and implementing personality substitution, we can solidify our inner being and make our idea a part of our usual assets. Remember to verbally presentify and visualize an action in the best possible way, allowing our spirit to take over and bring us closer to our desired personality and actions."
