  "title": "\"What is the seed of consciousness and how does it relate to false core and individual psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The final part of this text focuses on the I AM, which is the seed of individual consciousness. This seed is divided into a verbal and non-verbal version, which Nisargadatta Maharaj calls the \"Seed of Consciousness.\" Quantum Psychology views it as the Fruit produced by the Void of Undifferentiated Consciousness. The text reiterates that psychology and spirituality are maps, not true representations, and urges readers to discard them as NOT-I. The section also mentions a 1976 encounter between Nisargadatta Maharaj and a French psychiatrist, in which the former explains the nature of existence. The key principle is that without I AM, there would be no consciousness.",
  "content": "The False Core Driver-False Self Compensator cannot exist without the verbal I AM, because then whose False core Driver-False Self Compensator would it be? and the verbal I AM cannot exist without the NON-VERBAL I AM. For many \"psycho-spiritual\" traditions this is the end point. For Nisargadatta Maharaj, this was a beginning point(er), which, when it falls away, takes you beyond consciousness itself. He believed that once the I AM is or becomes stabilized, then the I AM itself can fall away.' In 1976 a French psychiatrist asked Nisargadatta Maharaj a long-winded question about births-deaths, credits-debits, etc. Nisargadatta Maharaj replied, \"Who told you that you exist? He then waited a few minutes for a response. When there was none, he said, Your mind tells you that you exist, consciousness tells you that you exist and you believe it. \"If you understand just this, it is enough.\" QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The I AM, as Nisargadatta Maharaj says, is the seed of \"your consciousness.\" No I AM, no consciousness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the principle of the I AM, as explained by Nisargadatta Maharaj and included in Quantum Psychology, is crucial for cultivating consciousness. By stabilizing the I AM, one can go beyond consciousness itself. However, it is important to remember that the I AM can visit us again and again, and through practice, we can learn to let go of everything else and experience the non-verbal I AM in our daily lives."
