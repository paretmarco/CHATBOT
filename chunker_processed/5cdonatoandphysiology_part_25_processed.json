  "title": "\"What were the Impromptu Hypnotic Scenes and Experiments by Mesmerist in Paris and Turin in the 19th century?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Mesmer describes some of his experiments with hypnosis in which he suggests certain scenarios to his subjects, who then act them out as if they were real. He mentions the reactions of various people, including Mounet-Sully, Jules Claretie, and Sara Bernhardt. In the final part of the text, Mesmer discusses his views on the study of hypnosis and its relationship to popular perceptions of the field. He expresses concern about the overblown claims of some scientists, which he feels are out of line with the true nature of hypnosis.",
  "content": "Another impromptu scene represents subjects shivering with cold; they pull up their coat collars, put their hands in their pockets and stamp their feet; one places his handkerchief about his neck. These scenes were totally unknown fifteen years ago when I commenced my demonstrative lectures in public halls. I improvised them all under the eyes of the spectators as circumstances suggested them to my mind. For example in 1886 at the war school of Turin, having fascinated about thirty young officers (from about 100 who submitted themselves) I made them go through their military exercises and take part in imaginary combats. I suggested to one that he was Garibaldi at Aspromonte; to another that he was the commanding general of the school, etc. They assumed the gait, the carriage, the gestures and the voices, and played perfectly the parts of the personages, whom they represented, and with whom of course they were acquainted; for fascination no more than hypnotism can give to anyone knowledge of the unknown. From the beginning of the study I blamed the exaggerations of a few savants.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of fascination and hypnotism should be approached with caution and skepticism, with a critical eye on sensationalized claims. While certain demonstrations may be impressive, such as impromptu scenes or imaginary combats, the exaggerated claims of some experts should be met with scrutiny and inquiry. Always seek out reliable, scientific research to better understand the true potential and limitations of these practices."
