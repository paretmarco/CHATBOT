  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to awareness of the body and dimensions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses how dissociation and splitting-off from any dimension lead to the loss of the present-time body and its potential for stabilization in underlying unity. Psychology, caused by a dissociation from biology, is pivotal for all eight dimensions. The author also lays out several basic Quantum principles, including that the body and the nervous system are a condensed VOID OR UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. These principles help us understand the importance of the biological dimension and the role it plays in our perception of reality.",
  "content": "The body and the nervous system are a quantum event, i.e., the body is condensed VOID OR UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. This basic principle is both Einstein's and Buddha's foundation. \"Everything is made of EMPTINESS and form is condensed EMPTINESS.\" Or Buddha's \"Form is none other than EMPTINESS, EMPTINESS none other than form. 2. When we \"see\" the body as a quantum event, we mean that the EMPTINESS condenses down forming a body with a nervous system and that the body and the nervous system cannot see the Quantum event. 3. Given that the body and the nervous system are also a condensation of EMPTINESS, they therefore select certain experiences and reject others. The latter part of the statement comes from the work of Alfred Korzybski. What was \"left out\" or omitted from Korzybski is that the perceiving mechanism and the nervous system itself are an abstraction of that Emptiness or Quantum level. This is a major error in Korzybski's general semantics. Its omission explains why Korzybski's students face frustrating problems in getting the \"changes\" they want through what Korsybski called Neuro-Linguistic Feedback. 4.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that the body and nervous system are a condensed form of void consciousness, and that experiences are selected and organized by the nervous system, can lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the limitations of our perceptions. By recognizing the trance-like nature of our nervous system's processing, we can strive to expand our awareness and embrace a more multi-dimensional perspective."
