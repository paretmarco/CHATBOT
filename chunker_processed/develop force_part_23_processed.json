  "content": "You feel then that he has in himself a reserve force, but do not know precisely how and where he possesses it. Is not right in his eyes neither in his ways, nor in his language, nor in its actions; nevertheless it exists and seems to be a part of him. That's exactly the fact: a little of that strength that he shows, and which you are aware of, has gone from you to him without your knowledge: is now a part of him, and a few minutes before, as it may seem odd, was for a small part a part of you! 3. His word has a particular authority. What he says creeps into soul and deeply impresses it. It moves and persuades, even when he does not seem to attach any importance to what he says. With a word, a look, a smile, he destabilizes, enchants, and seduces you. ---------------------- Harmony is also symmetry.

What he wants to get troubles your thought. Even away from him, the being that he directs his intentions to, infallibly remains his. In whom he is targeting, very quickly are developing, springing up and prevailing feelings, desires, and trends he likes to suggest. 5. He has a special look. Watch his look.",
