  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of fascination, specifically how the power of the look can be used to influence and captivate others. The previous sections discuss the role of the eye in human culture and traditions, as well as its connection to intuition and consciousness. The last 200 tokens focus on the magnetic qualities of a specific individual and the peculiar sensations that arise in those around him. The author describes how this person seems to exude a certain \"eurhythmy\" that leaves a lasting impression on those who encounter him. The text goes on to detail several ways that this individual's influence can be felt, including his ability to induce a hypnotic trance and his power to sway others from a distance.",
  "content": "You feel then that he has in himself a reserve force, but do not know precisely how and where he possesses it. Is not right in his eyes neither in his ways, nor in his language, nor in its actions; nevertheless it exists and seems to be a part of him. That's exactly the fact: a little of that strength that he shows, and which you are aware of, has gone from you to him without your knowledge: is now a part of him, and a few minutes before, as it may seem odd, was for a small part a part of you! 3. His word has a particular authority. What he says creeps into soul and deeply impresses it. It moves and persuades, even when he does not seem to attach any importance to what he says. With a word, a look, a smile, he destabilizes, enchants, and seduces you. ---------------------- Harmony is also symmetry. Indeed a good inter-hemispheric communication also appears in appearance (symmetric movements for example). 4. His will acts at a distance. Away from him, one feels prone to please him. What he wants to get troubles your thought. Even away from him, the being that he directs his intentions to, infallibly remains his. In whom he is targeting, very quickly are developing, springing up and prevailing feelings, desires, and trends he likes to suggest. 5. He has a special look. Watch his look.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the cultivation of personal magnetism requires a combination of physical and mental exercises to increase vitality, balance, concentration, self-confidence, and firmness of purpose. Proper breathing and muscle tension exercises are key to developing this magnetism, as well as fixity exercises and the development of a hypnotic gaze. By practicing these exercises, one can increase their influence and attract others to them, just like the mysterious man who possesses his own reserve force and special authority through his words, look, and courteous behavior."
