  "title": "\"Understanding Archetypical Physics: How Electromagnetic Implants Affect Our Spiritual Paths?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, Louise, who does body and energy work, talks with Wolinsky about the impact that working with electromagnetic fields has had on her life. She shares that she feels like she has limited and isolated herself because of her work. They then discuss an electromagnetic coil that Louise describes as feeling like an implant from another dimension. Wolinsky helps Louise explore how she has deceived herself about the power and usefulness of this mechanism. They also discuss how it has deceived her and how it works in her body. The conversation delves into the Archetypes present in Louise's spiritual path and how to go beyond them.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:The Electro-magnetic mechanism, how have you tried to deceive it? ________________ Louise:I pretend it is not there. Therapeutic Note We are separating in the languaging her from the Coil-implant that we are calling an Electro-Magnetic Mechanism. Wolinsky:How has the Electro-magnetic mechants de- ceived you? Therapeutic Note Here, I am trying to give \"her\" a greater ability to explore the Electromagnetic mechanism as a way to look at its impact and then dismantle it. Louise:Pretending it is useful. Wolinsky:How has the Electra-magnetic mechanism de- ceived itself? Louise:This is like science fiction. It is as if I am just a host for this Electro-magnetic mechanism. Wolinsky:How you doing now? Shaky. Where is the Electro-magnetic mechanism now? Is it still in your body? In the field around my body and in the nervous system. Does this Electro-magnetic mechanism have any movement? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Therapeutic Note Quantum Psychology discovered that the Electro-magnetic mechanism seems to pulsate, so I just want to bring her awareness further into \"haw\" it works. It pulses, very fast. Where is it in your body now? Here (stomach).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to note that the Electro-magnetic mechanism is not something that can be ignored or deceived, but rather it requires a deep exploration to understand its impact and dismantle it. Awareness of its pulsating nature can help in the process of therapy and ultimately lead to a better understanding of the self."
