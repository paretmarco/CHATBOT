  "title": "\"What is Biological Realization in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text about Quantum Psychology, the concept of the Biological Core is explored. The author explains that our biology is the foundation of our psychological makeup, and that our nervous systems are constantly preparing for survival events. The text also outlines a few Quantum Psychology principles, such as the idea that our conscious experience occurs before our ability to explain it, and that our reasons and beliefs are just by-products of our nervous system. The section goes on to discuss the challenges of developing awareness of the Biological Core, particularly in the fast-paced, industrial modern world.",
  "content": "They come \"after the experience\" to explain what and/or why something, which has already occurred, occurred. 133 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Reasons and their accompanying beliefs are just that. They occur at the thinking dimension but are a by-product of the nervous system and can only give reasons and justifications much later for what has already occurred in the past. Furthermore, the reasons and justifications are further away from reality (the experience itself) and hence, more disconnected from what is. Still, even though these are Quantum Psychological Principles, we will have to meet the problem at the level of the problem in order to understand the BIOLOGICAL CORE and what Quantum Psychology calls BIOLOGICAL REALIZATION. THE BIOLOGICAL CORE: THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF ESSENCE The development of awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE seems to be one of the \"slowest\" for two reasons: First, because it is in physical matter (as opposed to a thought or a feeling), it is denser. Second, the present time demands of our industrial society force us to lose awareness of our biology and push us beyond what a body can do.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the principles of Quantum Psychology, especially the idea that reasons and beliefs are a by-product of the nervous system that occurs after the experience, can help us develop a greater awareness of our biological core. Despite society's emphasis on psychology, by focusing on our body and its physical manifestation of essence, we can achieve the state of Biological Realization, leading to a deeper connection with ourselves and the world around us."
