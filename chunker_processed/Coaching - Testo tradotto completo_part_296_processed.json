  "title": "How can gustatory signals and presentification improve our ability to achieve goals?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the concept of presentification, an act of magic that involves creating and living out beforehand the next day already predetermined through ideation. The author emphasizes the importance of arousing the taste of the coming day within oneself and living it inside their body. The author urges readers to figure out moods they would like to experience, words to utter, feelings to sense and sights to experience. By doing so, presentification allows individuals to perceive their personality of tomorrow as if it is present in the magical crystal of presentification.",
  "content": "In the process, we must also try and figure out the moods which we might desire to experience, the words we are going to utter to the faces we will meet on the way, to whatever we will be hearing, feeling, suffering or enjoying. At first we will have to do that analytically, and then, by the final stage, we will do so through an act that summarizes a will and a desire which, owing to the fact it is going to transcend the sphere of the conscious, will transform each one of us into a magician unto his own self. It will thus cause the coming day to be felt as something present, in the process letting us perceive, through the magical crystal of presentification, what our personality will be tomorrow. The attitude resembles the one of a person facing a crystal ball. The only distinguisher is that the image will be suggested rather than be actually seen. By means of presentification, the future is going to be pulled into the field of the present. Presentification is thus an act of magic.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing presentification as a form of magic can help us align our desires and willpower to shape the future we desire. By envisioning our desired moods, words and feelings, we can transform ourselves and take concrete steps towards our goals. It's a powerful tool that can help us achieve success in life. Try it out and see the positive changes that it brings!"
