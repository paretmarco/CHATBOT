  "title": "What is self-hypnosis and how can it be used to improve personal and professional aspects of life?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, the focus shifts to the concept of self-hypnosis and its many benefits. The text emphasizes that self-hypnosis enables individuals to control their emotions, behavior, and mental processes, allowing them to overcome everyday stress, anxiety, and bad habits. The text also mentions some indicators that suggest a person is in a hypnotic state along with a simple induction method based on the Erickson model. Additionally, the text explores how hypnosis can be useful in personal and professional settings and explains that passing from one state of mind to another is automatic. Finally, the text delves into the subject of creative imagination and its connection to self-hypnosis. Overall, the section underscores why self-hypnosis is an efficient technique and why learning it can be a valuable skill.",
  "content": "When we speak about SELF-HYPNOSIS, we might as well talk about creative imagination and, until we can access this mental state, it is necessary to be in a deeply relaxed position. This position allows us to be receptive towards spontaneous images which come and go without rule. The more we are relaxed, the more we are open and sensitive to what fantasy is showing us. Autosuggestion is the preferred ground of SELF-HYPNOSIS, as suggestion is the preferred ground of hypnosis. When an image strikes the unconscious, conscious activity tends to cancel it and it is exactly at this moment that fantasy, and the ability to let it affect us, intensifies; thus, attention, judgment and reason cease to be on guard. Therefore, all techniques using suggestion and autosuggestion are based on distracting conscious attention, in both direct and indirect ways, to transmit certain sensations and images of the unconscious. Before we talk about hypnosis, we are going to enter more deeply into the subject of SELF-HYPNOSIS. I would also like to add something else to let you understand what are, in reality, auto-hypnotic and hypnotic techniques, discrediting the idea that they are something unknown or inexplicable (even if there are obviously further things to know about them more I can write in this introduction). WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BRAIN DURING HYPNOSIS AND SELF-HYPNOSIS? There are many theories on hypnotic phenomenon; the following is a very interesting one: We know that our brain is divided into two parts that are called hemispheres; each one has a particular role to play.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, self-hypnosis and autogenous training are powerful techniques that can be used to improve our mental and physical well-being. By accessing the creative right hemisphere of our brain in a deeply relaxed state, we can communicate with our unconscious mind and reprogram negative patterns of behavior. NLP takes these techniques further by restructuring our perception of reality and substituting negative learning with positive. Metaphors and the Time Line technique are effective tools for personal improvement and resolving problems. By learning to relax and focus our attention internally, we can become the masters of our own minds and create our own magic reality."
