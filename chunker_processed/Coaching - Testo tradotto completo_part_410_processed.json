  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the author delves into the importance of critically re-examining every meeting and visualizing upcoming appointments. The practice of tele-psychology or distance influencing is explained as a way to prepare for meetings the next day. The author suggests visualization techniques involving imagining the prospective client sitting in front of you, visualizing yourself as brimming with vitality, and the client accepting the business proposal. This practice, if done consistently, can lead to increased success in sales. The text emphasizes the importance of sincerity and rational and intelligent planning in all business dealings.",
  "content": "This is how you should do it: «Lie down on the bed, with your eyes closed, reclining on the back. Keep your hands down the sides, your legs nicely stretched, and impose a state of total passivity upon your body. Each one of you should imagine himself being a cloth doll, deprived of any nerves ... Thereafter, fully relax your muscular system, and free the mind from anything which concerns the physical body, thereby attaining a state of absolute motionlessness. Your will must be calm and intense». Once you have reached the desired condition, move on to the following four mental representations: 1. Visualizing the prospective client as sitting in front of you and submitting to your influence while you smile at him. 2. Induction and its resultant effects, by surveying the different phases of the potential sale down to its minute details. 3. Visualize yourselves being brimful of vitality! Visualize the inevitable consequence that the client will gladly accept your business proposal. 4.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve success in sales using tele-psychology, it is crucial to relax both mind and body and create vivid mental representations of the potential client and the sale process. With a calm and intense will, visualize your success and focus on the client's satisfaction. Before beginning negotiations, quickly flash through the stages of the sale from the night before. These steps will help you materialize the desired outcome and be triumphant in your endeavors."
