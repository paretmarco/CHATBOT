  "title": "\"What is Multi-Dimensional Awareness and Why is It Important for Discovering Who You Are?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the development of Multi-Dimensional Awareness, known as The Way of the Human. Before delving into functional awareness, the author expounds upon the different dimensions of being human- animal, thinking, emotional, ESSENCE, I AM, COLLECTIVE, and NOT-I-I. The author concludes that each dimension has a function and should work according to its nature without being substituted or overcome by another. The author relates the concept of Multi-Dimensional Awareness to Nisargadatta Maharaj's idea of consciousness being one. In essence, the text explores the idea of experiencing and appreciating all dimensions of being human through functional awareness.",
  "content": "This is The Way of the Human, to understand and allow all dimensions to function, without resistance, the way they were meant to function. This can be called the development of a FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS. FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS can be defined as the ability to place awareness on any single dimension, all dimensions simultaneously, or no dimensions, until awareness itself disappears in the VOID rather than having awareness habitually fixated and placed on only one or two dimensions. 5 The Way of the Human 0 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Nisargadatta Maharaj once asked a man, \"Why are you coming here to see me?\" \"Because the guru takes away the negative and gives us our true nature,\" he said. Maharaj replied, \"There is nothing that anyone can take away from you or give to you which you are not already since there is only THAT ONE CONSCIOUSNESS.\" All this considered, I am proposing that as humans we have an animal nature, a thinking nature, an emotional nature which contains feelings, and an ESSENCE with its essential qualities, etc. Awareness \"unfortunately\" seems to get fixated in one or more dimension.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing functional awareness and embracing multi-dimensional awareness can lead to the discovery of our true nature and help us realize the underlying unity of all substance. By allowing all dimensions to function without resistance, we can liberate awareness and tap into our biological spirituality, encompassing everything from emotions to thoughts and even our physical bodies."
