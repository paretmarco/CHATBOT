  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of fascination and how it can achieve significant changes in a person in a non-linear and quantum way. The author explains that fascination relies on mind-to-mind communication and the development of energy, which is achieved through a series of secret practices. The author shares a personal experience of using mesmerismus to heal a person without asking any questions. In the last 200 tokens, the author gives some simple hints for practicing fascination, starting with developing knowledge. Amidst the stunning results of modern telepathy and distance healing, rural traditions emphasized on non-verbal communication to produce superior outcomes.",
  "content": "Magnetism relies on the concept of energy and on the development of the operator energy in order to realize changes in the subjects. This is the Western school corresponding to the use of prana or chi in the East. For developing this force the operator will do a series of practices firstly on himself through a series of steps that once were kept very secret and taught only inside a spiritual path of development. This therapy is very powerful. Change is achieved in a non-linear and quantum way. The other day a person with a very disturbing and antisocial problem went to me. I knew his problems because his brother had spoken to me about them, but I was compelled to the secrecy about what I knew and this person did not want to speak about it. After I understood it, I did not ask anything any more. I just practiced \"mesmerismus\" (a magnetic technique) and the person got healed. I did not know how, but I strongly felt when the result was achieved, and so it was. Now I will give you some simple hints to begin practicing: 1 - Develop your knowledge.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, utilizing the powerful techniques of mesmerism and magnetic healing can lead to quantum changes in subjects in a non-linear way. To begin practicing, develop your knowledge of ancient books of hypnotism and discover forgotten phenomenologies. Additionally, practice making your eyes stronger to develop the necessary skills for magnetic therapy."
