  "title": "\"How can we achieve results through effective action and presentification of future goals?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, we delve deeper into how to achieve concrete results. The author emphasizes the importance of finishing tasks without delay and avoiding interruptions in order to save time and energy. They also stress the need to balance precision with speed, and to approach work with a fast-paced and lively rhythm. The text highlights the power of ideation and offers practical advice on how to turn ideas into reality.",
  "content": "Many people are fastidiously precise only on condition of spending long periods of time on some work; instead, one must be able to quickly follow up an undertaking with some other one. Such ability is attained by premeditating actions and their sequence properly, as well by proceeding at a swift pace. We should in fact remember that every thought is action, it is movement, just as every movement is thought. It ensues from it that we need to act in conformity with a «vigil and rapid», vital rhythm, as opposed to one which is torpid and somnolent. This is after all the only means we have to avoid getting bored while we work. Part Three – How to Achieve results A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. Presentification and Multiplication Ideation, as it has been described in the preceding pages of this book, is already a considerably powerful tool.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving results requires not only premeditated actions but also executing them swiftly in alignment with a \"vigil and rapid\" rhythm. Ideation alone holds considerable power, but effective action minimizes mental effort through resolution and without tension. Granting the human machine the chance to work towards a goal with uniform intent and presentification of future states is the perfect system to accomplish anything."
