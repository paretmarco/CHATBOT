  "title": "\"How can quantum psychology principles help transmute emotions into pure energy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the idea of transmuting all experiences into energy was discussed. Quantum Psychology suggests that resisting emotions or trying to get rid of them only reinforces their significance. The following practices aim to help individuals allow for the transmutation of their emotional energies. This is achieved through dharanas, which involves fixing one's attention on a set point - in this case, the emotion as a form of energy. This concept is in line with the notion of using the symptom as the cure. In this final part (200 tokens), the author emphasizes the importance of experiencing emotions as energy by removing labels and judgments. The purpose is to liberate oneself from habitual fixation and become more aware of the quantum level or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS.",
  "content": "Dharana is defined as fixing your attention on a set point. Tantra means the expansion of knowledge. To sum up 2Dharanas are ways of fixating attention by choice rather than automatically. It is interesting to note that Quantum Psychology is using Erickson's idea that the symptom is the cure. In other words, the symptom, or the \"problem,\" is that you have hypnotised yourself, i.e., you habitually shrink (fixate) your focus of attention. In Quantum Psychology, we ask the practitioner to knowingly, consciously and intentionally fixate on the emotion as a form of energy. In this way, we are using this fixating tendency, or better said, the early tantrics are using this fixating tendency to liberate you from its hold. 107 Chapter VII less sinful than, more healthy than, less unhealthy than, more healing than, more godly than, etc. Or, to say it another way, the emotion is already made of energy but how you experience it is transmuted. Take off the label called fear, and experience it as energy. If a tight chest is an indication to you that you are afraid, then focus your attention on your tight chest as contracted energy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by consciously fixing our attention on our emotions as energy, we can liberate ourselves from their hold and transmute the way we experience them. Quantum Psychology encourages us to take off the label of fear or guilt and focus on the sensation of contracted energy in order to heal ourselves."
