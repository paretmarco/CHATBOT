  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we follow the story of Perceval, a knight on a spiritual journey towards self-discovery and enlightenment. Perceval encounters his lover and learns about the significance of the spinal cord in energy transmission. He also meets an ugly woman, representative of imperfections in life, and overcomes them by realizing the transformative power of his energy. Perceval returns home and realizes the futility of attachments and seclusion, opting instead to find spirituality in everyday life. In the final section of the text, Perceval visits a hermit, where he faces challenges in living a fully spiritual life.",
  "content": "“ This experience is again a “repeated experience”. The ugly woman is the opposite of the beatiful unknown. It is matter. But it can be transformed. And it is shown by the fact that going to Arthur the woman becomes beautiful.

The exercises and experiences shared here aim to help us overcome fear, let go of attachments and understand our own perfection. By facing our challenges and purifying our heart, we can master our energy and live with courage. Remember, the word courage comes from the word coeur, meaning heart.
