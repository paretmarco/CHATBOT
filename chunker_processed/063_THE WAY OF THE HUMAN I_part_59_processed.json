  "title": "What is False Core Driver and False Self Compensator and how do they affect our perception of ourselves?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator were discussed, explaining how they shape an individual's interpretation of life. In this last part of the text, the concept of \"I AM\" is introduced as a way of undercutting the False Core by letting go of everything else. The False Core Driver-False Self Compensator can make one feel inadequate, incomplete, powerlessness, and loveless. Each person interprets the same trauma through their own lens. By dismantling the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator, one can experience ESSENCE and/or the I AM.",
  "content": "To illustrate, if three people got in a car accident, one might say \"I'm was in a car accident, it means I must be worthless.\" Another might feel a deep sense of powerlessness about it and still a third might say \"There's something wrong with me, I should have taken driving lessons.\" Each False Core Driver-False Self Compensator interprets the same trauma through a different lens. If you take off the lens (i.e., dismantle the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator) then you experience ESSENCE and/or the I AM. This is why ESSENCE, the I AM THE NOT-I I etc. go unnoticed or are not stabilized in our awareness. Most of our attention is unknowingly focused on the False Core Driver while at the same time we try to compensate for it in some way by creating a False Self Compensator. Any attempt to reform it, transform it, reframe it, re-associate it, take the good (healthy) stuff and leave the 28 25 ________________ Chapter bad (unhealthy), turn our vices into virtues, etc.â€”are all strategies of the False Self Compensator which tries to overcome, resist and resolve the False Core Driver.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to experience ESSENCE and the I AM, it is essential to dismantle the False Core Driver and False Self Compensator. It's important to note that any attempt to reform, transform, or reframe the False Core Driver is a strategy of the False Self Compensator, which tries to overcome and resolve the False Core Driver. Therefore, to experience true essence and self-actualization, one must first recognize and dismantle these false beliefs and perceptions."
