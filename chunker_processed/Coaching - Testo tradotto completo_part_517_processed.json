  "title": "What are the different stages of becoming a competent trader, and how does intuition play a role?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author describes the final stage of a trader's development where they become \"unconsciously competent\". In this stage, the trader has acquired intuitive acumen and the ability to earn through their tailor-made trading system. The focus is on operating in an unconscious manner and allowing the mind to function efficiently. However, it is essential to bear in mind the duty to place oneself in a position of \"not knowing\". Prior to this stage, in phase 3, the trader learns to examine the market and reason independently. Phase 2 is characterized by the trader's inclination to rely on peer advice and automated trading systems.",
  "content": "Such a trader has attained a level empowering him to shift to the next phase. 4. The next phase consists in the first steps by which the ability to be “unconsciously competent” develops. This does not of course exempt us from the duty to analyze the various situations (phase 3). The said ability represents in fact an addition to what the trader has already actualized in the preceding phase. The added element is represented by intuitive acumen. This is the moment in which we are capable of earning, since we are the ones who can create for our own benefit our personal, tailor-made “trading system”. We are now operating in an unconscious manner and well. It is indeed when we become unconscious that our mind starts acquiring a special degree of efficiency. At this point, an important aspect, if we desire our unconscious mind to function properly, is to always bear in mind the duty to place ourselves in a position of “not knowing”, i.e. a position whereby we refrain from falling prey to such expectations as \"the market is bound to ...\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, becoming an \"unconsciously competent\" trader is the ultimate goal, but it requires continuous analysis and a willingness to let go of preconceived notions. By developing intuitive acumen and creating a personalized trading system, traders can operate in an efficient and profitable manner. Remember to approach the market with an open mind, free of expectations and biases, in order to achieve success."
