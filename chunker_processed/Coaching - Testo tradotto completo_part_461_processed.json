  "title": "What are the key elements to define your objectives in trading and achieve success?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of defining objectives positively in trading, rather than focusing on negative aspects. The concept of earning quickly, without much effort is negated. Instead, traders should aim for a specific and measurable goal, within a suitable amount of time and energy expenditure. This approach reduces stress and enhances success, as opposed to a vague and undetermined target. The author suggests developing an underlying strategy to execute logical operations, which can greatly benefit our trading system.",
  "content": "“Earning a lot” is, instead, an expression marred by the fact that it is “indeterminate” in nature. When our mind hears the word “a lot”, it has no knowledge of what it means. Let us try and be more exact. What is it that, precisely, we wish to accomplish? “Earning quickly”, too, suffers from being a phrase marked by indefinite semantic contours. Besides, the trader who sets out on the basis of that premise runs a greater risk to fall into stress than his colleagues, given that he will lean to the side of doing things “hastily”. If the trader who thinks in that manner fails to achieve any result, we might then be tempted to feel that whoever follows a different kind of reasoning, for instance by having in mind the goal of earning the right figure, within the right time span, and with a consumption of energies which is suitably commensurate with that purpose, is more likely to accomplish his desires, especially if what is meant (even from a numerical point of view) by the word “right” is clearly etched in his mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve success in trading, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the desired outcomes and to avoid vague and indefinite expressions like \"earning a lot\" or \"earning quickly.\" A realistic, well-defined goal with a suitable level of effort and energy invested is more likely to be achievable. Moreover, analyzing the historical market events can provide valuable insights into underlying conditions that might statistically lead to profitable trades. Finally, adapting our strategies to the market's rules is crucial for success."
