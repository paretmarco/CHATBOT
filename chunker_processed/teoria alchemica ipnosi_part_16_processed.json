  "title": "What is the relationship between family dynamics and the balance of archetypes in our psyche?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, the author delves deeper into the concept of desire and its connection to our fixed structures of thinking and emotion. They discuss how projection, incorporation, identification, and introjection inform our perceptions of reality and how we can break away from these fixed patterns through processes like hypnosis. The author also explores how we relate to our parents and the archetypes they represent, the different types of conflict that can arise as a result, and how this affects our behavior. Overall, the text offers a unique perspective on the complexities of the human psyche and the various ways in which we navigate the world around us.",
  "content": "Confrontando i nostri genitori con i relativi archetipi e verificato chi dei due ne risulta troppo lontano, diventeremo conflittuali padre o asta e ci comporteremo in modo contrario al suo. Se al contrario tale differenza risulti a carico della mamma diventeremmo conflittuali madre o triangolo. Questa spiegazione risponde alle tipologie genitoriali ma per le egocentriche le cose cambiano un po’.\" i dinamismi di Proiezione e Incorporazione del pensiero analogico vanno a formare L’ESIGENZA, (l'orizzontalità che crea esigenze). L’identificazione e l’introiezione sono predisposte ALL’APPAGAMENTO (il farsi \"mangiare dalle cose\")",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by confronting our parents and identifying their archetypes, we can determine whether we may become conflicted parents ourselves. If we remain far from our father's archetype, we may become confrontational fathers or avoid them entirely by behaving differently. Alternatively, if the difference is due to our mother's archetype, we may become confrontational mothers or triangulate. Understanding the dynamics of projection and incorporation in analogical thinking forms the basis of our needs, while identification and internalization satisfy those needs."
