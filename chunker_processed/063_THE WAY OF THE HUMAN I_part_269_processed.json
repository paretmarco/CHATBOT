  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text delves into the concept of the False Core, which is triggered by biological deprivation. Deprivation in biological functions such as sleep, food, and sex tends to make an individual more vulnerable to the triggering of their False Core. The text also discusses the drive to \"know who you are\" as a primary biological learning function, viewed in Quantum Psychology. The mind emerges from the body through different levels of complexity and attempts to order chaos, ultimately ruled by the nervous system's fight/flight response. Quantum Psychology suggests that a shock occurs when both these systems are simultaneously ignited, causing a breakdown.",

(I can't get no satisfactionâ€”Rolling Stones) THE BODY MIND The mind emerges out of the body as it moves to different levels of complexity and attempts to order chaos. Korzbyski said, \"You can always say (think) more about what you said.\" In other words, systems too have a neurological component to delve into deeper and deeper levels of explanation. The fight/flight response of the nervous system ultimately rules the psychological process. So, to meet the problem at the level of the problem you have to dismantle the fight/flight fusion with past associations. \"Your\" identity, \"your\" psychology, and \"your\" False Core are formed as a survival mechanism. Quantum Psychology suggests that a shock occurs when both the fight and flight systems of the body are simultaneously ignited (this is also the feeling of a nervous 165 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness system breakdown). Such a shock causes the body's electrical systems to clash and crash into one another.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the intricate relationship between the body and mind can help us unravel the complexities of our psychological processes. By dismantling past associations and addressing the fight/flight fusion, we can unravel the chaos caused by shocks and prevent trances as an attempt to order that chaos. Ultimately, this can lead to a more multidimensional awareness and a better understanding of our selves."
