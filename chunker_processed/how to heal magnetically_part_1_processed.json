  "title": "\"How does Magnetic Healing work and how can you become a Natural Healer?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this article, the author discusses the simple yet powerful practice of magnetical healing, which involves entangling with the client and passing on information to solve their problems. The author emphasizes the importance of working on one's own presence and awareness to become a natural healer and overcome the three-dimensional difference in space between people. The concept of \"energy\" in healing is actually a deeper level of knowledge and perception, and as awareness is enhanced, so is the energy. The last 200 tokens delve into this idea further, exploring how this energy is also a vital force.",
  "content": "How to heal Magnetically Magnetical healing is very simple. It is a passage of information. Practically as you are near your client, you entangle with him. At this point if you can solve the problem in yourself, you can solve the problem in your client. Normally therefore a person that has overcome an illness can become a \"natural healer\". Working on presence is fundamental in order to learn by yourself to solve the problems and also to overcome the three dimensional differenvce in space between you and the other. Probably we are already all very entangled at a deep level, and quantum physics doesn't deny it, but we are not aware of it. To heal we must in some way go to this deeper level. If we do healing will naturally happen. What people call \"energy\" in reality is not energy in the habitual sense of the word. It is knowledge and perception of a deeper level where entanglement begins. Therefore some people says that energy seem to pass from a person to another. In reality both are feeling the same. The concept of energy is strictly bound with awareness. The more we enhance awareness the more we have energy. In some way this energy is also a vital force.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, magnetic healing is a simple yet powerful process that involves tapping into the deeper level of entanglement and awareness to pass on information and solve problems. By working on our presence and enhancing our awareness, we can become natural healers and channel the vital force that exists within us. Remember that the concept of \"energy\" is closely linked to our awareness, and the more we enhance it, the more energy we will have. So let us all strive to deepen our awareness and tap into our innate healing abilities."
