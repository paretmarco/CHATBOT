  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the importance of staying detached from money when trading and defining goals to avoid emotionalism. In the last part (200 tokens), the author advises readers to define their trading objectives within a time context using a time line. Without a guiding objective, the mind tends to wander around aimlessly. The author compares the optimal state of rest in physics to the need to achieve a goal to act beyond the chains of need in trading. The author uses human physics to illustrate how the cessation of urges represents an optimal state.",
  "content": "Advice 3: Define the objective you aim to achieve within some kind of time context A good method one can adopt for the sake of defining his objective within some kind of time context consists in resorting to the time line, which I suggest you should use, i.e. a system whereby you demarcate your objectives within a specific time sequence. In the absence of a guiding objective, the mind of each one of us is naturally inclined to roam around in several diverse directions. As stated earlier, in order to trade successfully one needs to have a goal, a goal enabling him to act beyond the fettering chain of need. In physics, as we know, the optimal state of a body is the state of rest, whereas, in the field of electricity, the discharge of a capacitor brings the agitation of the body itself to an end. To an extent, and to an extent only, human physics, too, is equated to that: If I am hungry, the optimal condition is the cessation of hungerâ€™s urges; if I am in a state of sexual plenitude, it is represented by the cessation of genital stimuli, and so on.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, defining a clear objective with a specific time context is crucial for success in any endeavor. Utilizing methods such as a timeline can help establish direction and prevent aimless wandering. However, it's important to remember that while gratification may temporarily bring satisfaction, the pursuit of excess can lead to unhappiness. Striving for a balanced approach is the key to achieving sustainable success."
