  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text, the author emphasizes the importance of setting a goal, especially in trading. It is crucial to remain detached from money and focus on other important things to prevent emotionalism from affecting trading decisions. The mind must be explicitly programmed and directed towards the achievement of the chosen goal. The trading market functions based on its own rules and conditions, and traders must adapt to it. The author warns that most people fail because they do not know what they want or have unclear goals. This advice is relevant for all traders who seek success and wish to avoid failure.",
  "content": "Advice 2: Stay detached from money but not from being “where money is” A most important element for a person who resolves on doing trading is to remain detached from money and not to think of monetary benefits when he carries out every single operation. This is one of the keys to maintain as much self-detachment as possible. It allows us to focus on other things more, and in that manner, emotionalism will be precluded from playing some nasty tricks to us. Defining a goal plays as important a role in life as it does in trading. It is only through the determination of a goal that we might become able to build around us whatever is needed to bring about its materialization. Our mind, indeed, is the mind of the primitive man, and only gets into action for the sake of fulfilling immediate needs. If we want our mind to do more, we are duty-bound to say that to it explicitly. We are entitled to think that our mind, in order for it to accomplish some specific matter, must be programmed and that there is a servomechanism which regulates the totality of unconscious thoughts so as to convoy us to the accomplishment of what we want.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you want to succeed in trading or any other aspect of life, it's crucial to define a clear goal and detach yourself from the distractions of immediate needs. Use a time context, like the timeline, to help you stay on track and focused on achieving your objectives. Remember, a mind programmed for success can lead you to accomplish great things beyond your wildest dreams."
