  "title": "\"What is Man's Two Times, Chronos and Kairòs, and How Can Recognizing Them Help You Seize Opportunities?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the importance of viewing each day as a self-contained unit that presents opportunities for growth and discovery. Now, we dive deeper into the concept of time and its relevance to our goals and opportunities. This section introduces the dual nature of time, with one being the programmed and logical time, known as chronos, while the other being the time of the now or Kairòs. Kairòs is the moment of potentiality and opportunities, where we can gain access to our potential and discover genial opportunities. The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing the right moment to align with reality and seize opportunities.",
  "content": "This concept might denote “doing things at the right moment”, as well as “being synchronized with reality”, or “being aligned with the now”. The ancient Greeks used to say that it was the time in which the god would manifest. This god, as we interpret it, might be deemed to represent potentiality and opportunity. They are in fact the dual set of coincidences which open up novel possibilities. Kairòs is the time in which we can gain access to our potential. It is the time in which chances and opportunities originate, and in which synchronicities occur. It is by paying attention to the now that possibilities arise and fall into our view, and that we are able to discover genial opportunities! Recognize the right moment! (???????? ? ?????) (Pittaco of Mytilene) Characteristic features of man’s two times We have, therefore, two different times in man: One of them is programmed and logical time, a time of becoming which we might call by the Greek term chronos.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, recognizing the value and power of kairòs, the time of opportunities and joy, while also utilizing the programmed and logical time of chronos as a foundation, can enable a fulfilling and successful life. Pay attention to the present moment and keep an open mind for novel possibilities to arise. Remember that the right moment can be a turning point in your life."
