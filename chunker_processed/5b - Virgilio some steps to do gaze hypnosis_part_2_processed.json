  "title": "\"What are the techniques for achieving deep hypnotic states in just 3-4 seconds?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the text, the author discussed the rapid induction of a hypnotic state in subjects. The author explains that the best way to achieve this state is to surprise the subject and create a sense of amnesia. In the last 200 tokens, the author describes the specific techniques they use to prepare themselves before starting the induction. They widen their gaze, imagine a specific color, and take a deep breath to get energy from the person. They also move their hand in a clockwise motion to put the subject's third eye chakra into action. The author also mentions touching the subject's chin as a way to create a deeper level of trance.",
  "content": "standing, back of the feet touching themselves What do you do at the begin? I widen my gaze. I call this action \"taking control of the room\". In this way my peripheral view get more open and my whole brain begins working. To be sure I'm widening my gaze I imagine the subject becoming smaller. I do also some specific exercises for this task before even seeing the person. And after? I imagine a colour. Everything of this colour. This action will put my right brain also in action as my right brain is very sensible to colours. And after? At the same time I breath in. And breathing I feel I'm getting the energy of the person upfront. After I will hold my breathing during the whole exercise. Only at certain moments, when I will feel without air I will very fast breath in. And what you do also? I move my hand with the finger pointed doing a circle clockwise in face of the person and for putting the hand away I change the direction of the motion, this will put his third eye chakra in action. Why you touch his kin?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking control of the room by widening your gaze, imagining a color, and breathing in while doing a clockwise circle with your finger can help you align and put someone on your energetic line. Touching their chin in a specific moment can also aid in hypnotic influence as they find themselves compelled to look at you, just like the legend of the Basilisk."
