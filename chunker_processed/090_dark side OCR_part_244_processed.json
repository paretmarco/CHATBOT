  "title": "How does the Nervous System organize chaos through archetypes and beliefs?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the concept of the collective unconscious and how it might not be a mystical world of gods and goddesses, but rather a part of the nervous system designed to organize pain and chaos. The author emphasizes empowering the individual and understanding that beliefs are not the same as the self. In the last 200 tokens, the author offers practical steps to handle spiritualization, including identifying the beliefs of the inner child and comparing them with the chosen spiritual or religious philosophy. The author invites readers to notice where the inner child may live in their bodies and the spiritualization trances they use.",
  "content": "* It is not my goal to destroy belief structures. It is my purpose to empower you, the creator of the belief structure. When finding out Spiritualizing â€¢ 149 who you are, all belief structures, that are like sacred cows, stand in the way ! Noted philosopher Alfred Korsybski said, \"The map, is not the territory.\" In this way beliefs, ideas, images are not you. Rather you are the observer and creator (the territory) of the images (the map). The Next Step Handling spiritualization 1. Notice what religious or spiritual philosophy your inner child seems to be attracted to. 2. Write down the basic beliefs of that spiritual or reli- gious philosophy. 3. Notice the beliefs of the inner child and write them down. Note that the beliefs of the inner infant, (being taken care of) are often \"wishes.\" 4. Compare the two belief structures to see if there is a parallel. 5. Notice where the inner child may live in your body (mouth, heart, pelvis, etc.). 6. Notice which spiritualization trances you're inner in- fant/child uses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that belief structures are not solely your identity but rather a map you create on your journey towards self-awareness can empower you. By handling spiritualization, identifying personal beliefs, and examining its parallels with spiritual or religious philosophy, you can overcome any obstacle hindering your growth and live a fulfilling life. Remember, the map is not the territory, and you are the creator of your beliefs."
