  "title": "\"What is the significance of trees and nature in the Western Martial Art of Chivalry?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of chivalry as a western inner martial art and delves into the importance of trees in Celtic and Magnetism traditions. Before the final 200 tokens, the author shares two exercises related to taking contact with nature and the body. They emphasize the symbolism of trees and their connection to a higher dimension in magnetism and divine consciousness in Celtic beliefs. In the last part, the author leads the reader through a magical guided imagination exercise of Perceval's encounter with the Tree of Life and the head of the deer on it, representing one's energy reaching the head.",
  "content": "In Magnetism, we see that contact with the trees opens up to a higher dimension in magnetism, The Marquis de Puysegur worked wonderful healings with the trees In order to get in contact with the tree, our conscious mind should go away and we must confound ourself with the Nature This is the meaning of the head of the Stag that confounds itself with the branches of the tree Symbolism For the Druid, the crown of the tree and its branches had a specific meaning. They were directed towards the sky and were moved by the wind; for the Celts, it was the part of the tree that signified the divine plane of consciousness, the elevated suprahuman plane. Chivalry of the Grail Celtic Mystery Initiation READ AND MEDITATE We are now at a higher level of initiation. Alchemically we are at the white stage (spirituality) and after we will enter the red stage Just try to imagine what corresponds to the different images of the ninth castle. Magical Guided Imagination To be done listening or reading and repeating trying to feel: You are Perceval. You see now an immense tree in front of you Is a tree under which even one hundred of knights could sleep This tree is the tree of life on it is is a head of deer The head of dear has become as part of the tree itself It means, that your energy should now be part of yourself and arrive until your head You can bring up the forces coming from the bottom of you, from your vegetative part Feel again your gravity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, contact with trees can enhance our experience and understanding of magnetism, leading us to a higher level of initiation. By confounding ourselves with nature and immersing ourselves in guided imagination exercises like the one described in this text, we can connect with the divine plane of consciousness symbolized by the crown and branches of the tree. As we reconnect with our energy and remain aware of our true selves, enlightenment becomes a possibility. So let us stay grounded and not be submersed again by the illusory, guided by the Mysteries of the Chivalry of the Grail."
