  "first_phrase": "In the third and final demo on gravity, Wolinsky asks Alice about her assumptions regarding gravity and its role in holding things together. They explore her limited self-ideas and her need to hold herself together, which she associates with gravity. This conversation sheds light on the physics dimension of gravity and its archetypes in the gravitational dimension. The conversation involves the concepts of gravity, sensation, and self-identity.",
