  "title": "\"How can we use intuition and meditation to find our true direction in life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about the idea that inborn gifts can help us to choose a direction in life. It emphasizes the importance of paying attention to thoughts, facts, and coincidences that seem to indicate a specific path. Carl Gustav Jung's quote is used to emphasize the idea that we are not limited by causality and that our psyche lives out of goals it aims for. The last 200 tokens emphasize that these \"opportunities\" are never constrictions, but rather openings that represent possibilities granted by the Universe. The passage encourages readers to engage in moments of deep meditation to help identify their chosen direction and to ask for inspirational ideas that can serve as a guide.",
  "content": "One way of approaching the issue is to ask ourselves this question and then be present, armed with sensory attentiveness. In that case, the Universe might reply to us. Go back to a state of intense presence, and feel the direction which energy takes. Follow that direction with confident trust. You can rest assured that the answer will come. Do not be afraid of posing the question again. Pay heed to the “synchronicities” which penetrate your life, that is, to the “opportunities” that correspond to the essence of your beings. Exercise 34 Opportunities, openings, coincidences around me: _______________________________________ The previous type of research will find completion by engaging in moments of deep meditation which are capable of corroborating, in your eyes, the soundness of the direction that has been chosen. If that is done, your dimension will arise out of the signs provided by intuition. Make use of the relaxation techniques which have been described in the preceding chapter, and ask for some words that are capable of acting as inspirational ideas in your life. What might emerge are such words as “building”, “communicating”, or even “loving”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by being present and attentive to the synchronicities and opportunities that arise in our lives, we can follow the path that resonates with our true essence. Engaging in deep meditation and relaxation techniques can help us confirm the direction we have chosen and receive inspiring words that guide us towards our goals. Do not hesitate to ask the important questions and trust that the answers will come."
