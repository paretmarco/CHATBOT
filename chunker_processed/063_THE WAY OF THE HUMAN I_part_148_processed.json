  "title": "\"How can we find peace amidst the ever-changing nature of our thoughts and emotions?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author talks about the nature of thoughts and their impact on our experiences. They explain that identifying with a particular thought, whether positive or negative, leads to a limiting experience. Many of the exercises discussed in this text, Quantum Consciousness and Hearts of Fire, are aimed at developing multi-dimensional awareness to prevent such limiting experiences. The author also describes common experiences such as waking up feeling good or attracted to someone but then later having negative thoughts about them. The purpose of the practice is to bring the reader back to the space between thoughts to prevent identifying with them.",
  "content": "\"I feel good because I meditated this morning.\" \"I feel good because I had a lot for dinner.\" \"I feel good because I didn't' have a lot for dinner.\" Around noon, a thought goes by which says, \"I'm tired,\" and if you identify with that thought, you might say, \"I'm tired, why do I have to go to work? It's such a drag. I knew I slept too much—or I didn't sleep enough,\" or whatever the sequence of events you might be experiencing. What happens is, a thought arises and subsides, and there's a space. This is the way thoughts occur: they arise, and subside—and there's space. The purpose of this practice is to bring you back into the space between two thoughts or prior to your last thought. Understand that anything you identify with yields a limiting experience. For example, a thought goes by called \"I feel good,\" or \"I feel bad, I wish I were there, I'm here, I wish I weren't here.\"",
  "last_phrase": "Remember that identifying with your thoughts can lead to limiting experiences. The nature of the mind is to always change, so allow for space between thoughts instead of getting caught up in them. Whether it's through meditation or simply being mindful, finding that space can bring greater peace and clarity to your life."
