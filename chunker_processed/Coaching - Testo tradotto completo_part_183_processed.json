In the last 200 tokens, the text highlights the importance of defining one's life ideals and how they can be developed to yield concrete results. It emphasizes the freedom individuals have in choosing their ideal profession and activities, with the aim of expressing their primal impulse. The text ends with a quote from Edison, emphasizing the power of an idea in the mind of an individual.",
  "content": "The one who comes up with the word “to love” at the time of answering the question referred to in the description of the preceding exercise, might probably want to inject love into his work, and have a preference for activities which involve adding value to other people and enable a form of exchange, with the result that he will find his self-development in them. We accordingly enjoy a very extensive degree of freedom in defining these ideal professions and activities, always bearing in mind to somehow find an outlet of expression for the primal impulse which has set us onto our own specific directions. Life’s events and circumstances are opportunities which facilitate progression on the path, so long as the wayfarer’s attitude is the right one. Primary impulse Defining one’s life ideals Developing powerful ideals “Whatever existed was first lodged in the mind of some individual” Ponder the aforesaid sentence carefully.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, shaping our ideal profession around our primary impulse and developing powerful ideals is essential to fulfilling our life's purpose. To move forward and turn our grandiose ideas into reality, we must educate our imagination to build a bridge between reality and our desired outcomes. By doing so, we can rapidly cross various stages and achieve what we truly want, rather than what we should. So, let's strive to inject love into our work, add value to others, and find meaningful outlets for our primal impulses to lead fulfilling lives."
