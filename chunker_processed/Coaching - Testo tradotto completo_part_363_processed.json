  "title": "How can we effectively define our goals and create a direction for our actions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the first phase of realization, which is defining what we want and establishing a direction for achieving it. Moving forward, the author delves into the two ways of implementing this phase, namely \"classical\" and \"accelerated\" or \"modern.\" In the last 200 tokens, the author details the \"classical\" way, which includes two distinct moments - one in the morning and the other in the evening. During those times, we should focus on the obstacles that require a solution and think of possible solutions without straining ourselves excessively. The author provides a timeline of ten to fifteen minutes for this process, and if there is more than just one problem, we should classify and direct our attention to each separately.",
  "content": "By secluding ourselves to our best capacity, we might be able to focus our undivided thought on the obstacles we are called upon to surmount, on the different points concerning which we neatly perceive the route leading us to their successful implementation. In this manner, we would be creating an “accumulation of thought”. Let us also think of possible solutions, without however straining ourselves excessively in the process. We should in any event think that we are eventually going to find a way out of those problems. We ought to say to our own selves: “This is what I like to see materializing irrespective of any thing”. The time required for the accumulation of thought which is suitable to activate the answer ranges from ten to fifteen minutes. If more than just one problem exists, you should classify them, first and foremost in order of urgency, and then direct your attention to each one of them separately.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by taking the time to seclude ourselves and accumulate our thoughts, we can effectively find solutions to our problems. It is crucial to prioritize the issues and focus on each one separately, while holding onto a strong intention to obtain a reply. By using open-ended affirmations and asking ourselves the right questions, we can tap into our infinite potential and find creative methods to overcome any challenging situation. Remember to stay positive and believe that you will eventually find a way out."
