  "title": "How does quantum psychology principle explain the importance of dissolving past-time body images to experience present time biology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author delves into the concept of past body images and its impact on present experiences, specifically in relationships. They emphasize the importance of dissolving past body images to fully experience the present. The author also discusses the biological tendency to merge, citing it as a survival strategy for the species. However, problems in relationships arise when people collapse different levels and cannot distinguish between them. This can lead to emotional turmoil and difficulties when interacting with others.",
  "content": "For example, if I get involved with a woman, there's going to be a biological interest in merging and that's fine as long as I simultaneously know she is a human being, has her own life and a whole universe that is separate from mine. In other words I do not collapse the levels and think she is or has to be the same as me (see Volume II). In this way, I can have a biological merging or unity experience at one level while simultaneously maintaining other levels of separation (i.e., thinking and emotional, biological, external). Prob- 154 Chapter VIII lems in relationship occur because people do not distinguish levels. If you have a past time body image of yourself, you have to hold a past time body image of her/him. This might make her/him into my mother or father. This means I have frozen and collapsed the external biological, thinking, and emotional levels. Then, you go through rages, fear, depression, etc. when she/he says \"I can't make it Friday night.\" Why? Because you are in your past time body image, and hence you are collapsing the levels.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to have a successful and healthy relationship, it is essential to differentiate and maintain various levels, such as emotional, biological, and external, and avoid collapsing them. Recognizing the body as an animal with its tendencies is crucial to keep in mind to prevent any potential problems. Finally, understanding that the images of the body are not who we are and being like a child, prior to all images, can help us enter the kingdom of heaven (the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS)."
