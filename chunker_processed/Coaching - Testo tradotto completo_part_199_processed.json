  "title": "What is \"kairòs\" time and how can it expand consciousness and enable us to work with subtle realities beyond physical reality?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"kairòs,\" a type of time that enables individuals to work effectively with subtle realities beyond physical reality, allowing them to achieve results such as distance healing and unexpected coincidences. The author notes that this type of time allows individuals to move beyond physical time-space reality and develop greater consciousness and comprehensiveness. The use of exercises that enhance cerebral coherence may contribute to this state, which is related to the possible occurrence of non-local effects, as explained by quantum mechanics. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the idea that human consciousness may have a role in creating reality, and the potential ways to use this to achieve desired outcomes.",
  "content": "to deal with a dimension where it is possible to attain substantial results “beyond physical reality”, such as, for instance, distance healing, as well as coincidences, those unexpected facts which allow us to progress at supersonic speed towards the goal we have set out for, or even towards completely new goals we had never even imagined before. It is as if, within the time of “kairòs”, man, by establishing a link with reality, “moved beyond” and thereby arrived at a dimension no longer capable of being expressed at the level of the physical time-space reality. The kairòs in fact corresponds to an expansion of the consciousness and a greater extent of comprehensiveness. Kairòs is a time of energetic attention to the now. The development of such a state might likewise be rendered smoother by implementing specific exercises which “allow a better” and more complete “functioning” of the brain. In the eyes of quantum mechanics, states of elevated cerebral coherence are related to the possible occurrence of “non-local” effects, that is to say, effects which no longer fall within the traditional categories of cause ? effect 49. ?",
  "last_phrase": "In order to fully embrace the expansive realm of kairòs beyond physical reality and reach our goals at supersonic speed, we must focus on energetic attention to the present moment and implement exercises to assist with the functioning of the brain. While each day is a self-contained unit, it is also a part of a larger line that requires careful equilibrium of pleasures and duties. By creating shape and direction in each day, we can discover new opportunities for positive paradigm shifts and achieve substantial results beyond our physical reality."
