  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the text discussed the power of fascination, which has been historically used by hypnotizers to induce a state of complete openness and receptiveness in subjects. It also touched upon the criminal usage of similar techniques for hypnotic theft. In this conclusion, Dr. Paret and his fellow researcher discussed their personal encounters with Virgilio Torrizzano, an ancient tradition initiate, and how he taught them a complete system behind the power of fascination stretching back to the Egyptians. They reveal that fascination is different from clinical verbal hypnosis and its study can prove to be useful for hypnotists seeking to help individuals achieve balance and recover their true selves.",
  "content": "We discovered it was not a single technique, but the tip of an iceberg: a complete system with its self-hypnosis, its therapy and a serie of steps of practice. If we had not carried out these researches these secrets would have survived only in the ancient tales or in their worst part, in the criminal approach. There are still some people, mostly in Italy and Russia, who are using states similar to those induced by fascination for hypnotic theft. These same techniques instead can be very useful for human growth. Most researchers agree that the state of fascination is different from what is intended with the current clinical verbal hypnosis, even if in some elements both techniques can overlap. As many readers of this article will already know the verbal school of clinical hypnosis we will explain here some of the differences between the two systems. For any hypnotist it is very helpful to know the secrets behind fascination, as one of our duties as practitioners is to use any technique which would prove useful to help individuals change and recover their true self as well as their psychosomatic balance; and many times with fascination we can get to these results faster and stronger.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while fascination techniques have been historically associated with criminal behavior, they are actually part of a larger system that includes self-hypnosis, therapy, and steps of practice that can be used for personal growth. Understanding the secrets behind fascination can prove useful for hypnotists looking to help individuals change and reach their true potential, and can even lead to profound changes in perception and immediate answers from the inner mind."
