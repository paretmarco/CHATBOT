  "title": "Can Rolfing or Feldenkrais Solve Psychological Issues Alone? The Importance of Appreciating the Interconnection of Body and Mind",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the interconnection between the body and the mind, and how it affects one's psychological well-being. The author argues that psychological, spiritual, and somatic re-education alone are not enough to help a person overcome deep-rooted issues such as phobias or low self-esteem. They illustrate this by using the example of incest survivors who can receive psychotherapy, but still experience psychological fears when their bodies go into a similar position as when they were molested. This is because the body and psyche are holographic and cannot be separated. Understanding this interconnectedness is crucial for achieving holistic healing.",
  "content": "Because each dimension, i.e., thinking, body-work, etc., uses different (although interconnected) parts of the brain as in holistic medicine. If the liver is not used or orchestrated well with the digestive tract, then the stomach must work harder. The results may be that your food will not be metabolized as well. In the same way, if your cortex (thinking center) is overused, your sense of the body will be underused (to be be discussed later). To illustrate further, let us take the example of incest survivors. Incest survivors can receive psychotherapy and yet, when their 122 Chapter VIII bodies go into the same or a similar position as when they were molested, their psychological issues come back again. Why? Because the body and psyche are holographic; that is, they have different functions but yet are totally interconnected and not separable. For this reason, the \"unprocessed\" body memory forces the psychological fears around the molestation to re-emerge.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to understand the interconnectedness of our body and mind, as neglecting one can affect the other. Psychological work and bodywork must be done at the level of the problem, as using only one tool to solve a problem can be ineffective. It is essential to strive for holistic medicine, addressing all dimensions of our beings to achieve optimal health and wellness."
