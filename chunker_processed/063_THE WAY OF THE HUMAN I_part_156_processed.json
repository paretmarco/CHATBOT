  "title": "\"How can questioning your thoughts free you from limiting beliefs and increase self-awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, we saw how identifying with our thoughts can limit us. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares a personal experience of meditation in India. While meditating in a cave, a thought arises \"It's an uphill battle all the way.\" The author emphasizes the importance of observing those thoughts and questioning the \"I\" that identifies with them. This leads to a space of awareness, beyond the limitations of the ego. Through this practice, the author suggests we can break free from the constraints of our thoughts and experience a deeper sense of freedom.",
  "content": "and continued, \"Notice that there is a space that opens up after the question, Who is this IT\" To repeat, anything that you believe about yourself is limiting: \"I feel good,\" \"I feel bad,\" \"I'm tall, short, fat, thin, ugly.\" Whatever thought comes into mind that you identify with will limit you, it doesn't matter what the content is. \"I like it here,\" \"I love myself,\" \"I hate myself'â€”they are all thoughts. When a thought arises like, \"I feel good,\" ask, \"To whom does this thought arise?\" Answer, \"To me.\" Then ask, \"Who is this I?\" Begin to notice that there's a space at the end of that question. Notice that space. When \"I\" was in India, \"I\" used to start meditation at 3:00 a.m. One morning \"I\" was meditating in the cave and a thought came by, \"It's an uphill battle all the way.\" It arose very gently.",
  "last_phrase": "By recognizing that thoughts and beliefs can limit us, we can ask ourselves \"to whom\" they arise and begin to create a space for new perspectives. By questioning our assumptions and beliefs, we can break free from limiting patterns and expand into new possibilities for our lives."
