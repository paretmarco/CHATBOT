  "title": "What is the enneagram personality tool and how can it be used to improve communication and understanding in personal and professional relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of enneagram and its practical applications in personal and professional settings. Enneagram is a system that describes nine different personality types, which can be used as a tool for understanding ourselves and others, as well as for predicting and developing behaviors. The last 200 tokens of the text focus on the enneagram as a tool for communication, allowing us to observe our interlocutor's behaviors and identify their enneagram type, enabling us to behave accordingly and establish an instant rapport. This text also includes a brief description of each enneagram type and their key motivations, as well as information on representational types and communication styles.",
  "content": "For example, if a personality is dominated by the compulsions of the type to which it belongs, we refer to “false personality” or “destructive self”. The enneagram is a new answer to the research of understanding ourselves and others, communication, and relationships between human beings. “He that has made a door and a lock has also made a key” (Chabreuil) Hypnosis in NLP is a developed ability to communicate which allows us to establish excellent relations with others, and grow towards autonomy, freedom and the appreciation of life in all of its glory. We can control our brain together with its functioning in its relationship with ourselves and we can make it carry out the instructions we give it. For example, if we speak angrily, the brain selects anger and arranges an adequate state of mind to the thoughts activated. On the other hand, if we express ourselves with enthusiasm, the brain will process this type of response and produces a happy state of mind. “Our brain is a learning machine and we are its programmers!!!!! !” Passing from one state of mind to another is an automatic ability. This is demonstrable when we watch two lovers together: both of them depend on smiles and words of love in order to feel being in hell or heaven.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hypnosis is a natural state that we experience in our daily life, and it can be used as a tool to improve the quality of our life and relationships. Hypnotic communication models, like negative orders, can help improve communication skills. Hypnotic induction methods, such as the Erickson model, can be used for relaxation. Auto-hypnosis, both western and eastern, is a powerful technique that can help us overcome anxiety, stress and bad habits, and achieve our goals. The right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for creative imagination, a skill that can be enhanced through hypnosis. Ultimately, we have the power to control our own brain and improve our lives through hypnosis."
