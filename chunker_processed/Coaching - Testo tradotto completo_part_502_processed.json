  "title": "How can self-hypnosis help traders avoid psychosomatic risks and make better decisions in a quantum market?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, the author delves into the psychosomatic risks traders face while actively engaging in their activities. The emotional reactions, if kept for too long, can develop into a chronic form, thereby reducing our energy capacity. The author also explains the process of self-hypnosis, which helps traders develop self-control and learn new patterns of behavior. The subconscious mind is compared to a servomechanism, where conscious learning leads to automatic motion, freeing our thought to focus on other things. The text makes it clear that practicing the discipline of feeling emotions as mere sensations can help avoid the risk of being \"hypnotized\" by the market.",
  "content": "It is additionally possible, within the process of self-hypnosis, to learn new patterns of behaviour, and also, for whoever is prey to stress-related reactions, to develop self-control. Some people have compared the subconscious mind to a servomechanism which, after we have consciously learnt a certain experience, makes it its own, thereby enabling us to subsequently re-enact that experience more rapidly, and, especially, without even thinking about it. We have consciously mastered the way of driving a car, but now, whenever we are busy driving the different operations connected with it have become for us automatic motions to be made. That ensures we are no longer forced to focus our thought on them, and we are accordingly free to talk while driving. In the selfsame manner, we have learnt plentiful other ways of being related to the outside world, and we do not consciously inquire as to what we do; sometimes, our \"automatic conduct\" might be right, whereas on other occasions it might be wrong. Still, there are frequent times and situations where we act automatically.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, self-hypnosis offers the potential for mastering new behaviors and self-control, while also unlocking our natural capacity for self-improvement and reducing stress and anxiety. By understanding the similarities between the subconscious mind and quantum systems, traders can benefit from incorporating self-hypnosis into their trading strategies for enhanced decision-making abilities."
