  "title": "What is Instant Fascination and How Does it Work to Heal Physical and Mental Ailments?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, we delve deeper into the extraordinary abilities of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa as a fascinator, healer, and hypnotherapist. The text recounts several anecdotes where he was able to put people in a hypnotic state through his mere look and issue them with instructions. He was highly successful in curing various kinds of ailments, addictions and pathologies almost instantly. Despite his exceptional abilities, he used his powers only for healing purposes and was ethical in his work. The text also highlights his benevolent personality, which was marked by his generosity, expansive nature and willingness to impart his knowledge to others.",
  "content": "It was only then that Erminio “woke him up”. The waiter had been blissfully unaware of the whole incident! On yet a different occasion, Roberto Catalano asked him whether he, too, was able to get back as change more than what he would actually pay. Di Pisa immediately replied in the affirmative. As a bet, he handed ten thousand liras to a girl, and, looking into her eyes with an intense expression, he said to her, ‘More, more, more.’ The girl then continuously gave him change without realizing what she was doing. Eventually, Di Pisa said to her, ‘You have given me too much change’, and gave the excess sum back to her. This kind of fascination, followed by an automatic motion, reminds one of some of the methods the gypsies use in order to fascinate. Professor Di Pisa, however, would only use such techniques for curative purposes. He was quite ethical in his work. In one instance, when we were at the restaurant, he wanted to give us a live teaching of how his look worked, and we were deeply impressed by it. He was extremely good at the so-called post-hypnotic suggestions, which he frequently executed by using some accompanying object. Erminio was also well-versed in instant regressions, that is, the situations where a person would access his past in a few seconds. This is a very powerful therapeutic dynamics.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the technique of Instant Fascination, pioneered by Erminio from Pisa, has proven effective in eradicating a range of physical and mental ailments. This therapy, which involves using intense gazing to transport patients to a state of \"non-thinking\", has been scientifically examined and boasts a success rate of 97%. By helping patients overcome their fears and anxieties and concentrate on internal mechanisms instead of external stimuli, the therapy of the look offers a powerful method of healing. Its effectiveness is further supported by research in the US, which has shown that rewriting memories can uproot traumas without drugs."
