When, however, the inspiring purpose is valid, it will be extremely easy to ready the means for its attainment and to channel our vital force. There is nothing mysterious in all of that. The only thing that is needed is to find a way to elaborating a system by which our goal is made clear to our mind. That is precisely what the present book achieves. The first key: Establishing connection with oneself Many people speak of luck, but luck is born out of our own thoughts. It arises out of the way in which we think, react, feel in the world, and relate to it. Even the frequency of what we call “coincidences” increases for the person who is pursuing and evolving a plan based on his own self. The aims and ideals which are capable of granting us satisfaction, and in which we can invest energy, are those which are connected with our profound individualized essence.",
