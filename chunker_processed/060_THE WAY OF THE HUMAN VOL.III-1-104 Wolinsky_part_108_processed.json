  "title": "\"What happens when ESSENCE and Light are fused? Exploring concepts and emotions in therapy.\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this conversation between Sylvia and Wolinsky, they discuss the concepts of ESSENCE and light. Sylvia suggests that they are fused together, and Wolinsky asks what experience is created as a result. Sylvia states that experiences are just another concept, which leads to a discussion of separating the concept of GOD from the concept of light. Sylvia admits that she is resisting accepting that all of these concepts are made up and reveals that she is feeling sadness, which Wolinsky probes further. The conversation ends with them discussing the false core and realizing that \"I\" is a construct that arises to meet the external context.",
  "content": "Sylvia:There is no experience. Wolinsky:Regarding these concepts of light, is there any- thing you are resisting knowing? Sylvia:I must now know all this is made up. Wolinsky:Regarding these concepts, are there any emotions you are resisting? 101 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psycholog_yChapter 111 Sylvia:Sadness.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that emotions like sadness and anger are just concepts that can block out light and prevent us from fully experiencing and learning from life. By viewing them as such and allowing light to penetrate, we can dissolve the False Core and move towards a more fulfilling existence."
