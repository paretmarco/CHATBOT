  "title": "What is the Fascination Technique in Hypnotic Gaze Induction and How Does it Differ from Verbal Hypnosis?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the fascinating technique and how it can be used for human growth, rather than criminal purposes. In this concluding part, the author delves deeper into the mechanics of fascination, highlighting the differences between fascination and traditional verbal hypnosis. The text explains the physiological changes that occur during fascination, specifically in the eyes and perception of the subject, resulting in visual hallucinations and a change in perception. The concept of the \"dark focus\" is discussed, and the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the secrets behind fascination for any hypnotist seeking to help individuals change and recover their true selves.",
  "content": "Fascination can for example be very useful for getting immediate answers from the inner part of our mind. What does it really happen during this kind of hypnotic gaze induction? Firstly, there is a profound change in perception. The ancient spoke of \"mist\". In this mist the subject often experiments an immediate trance, he feels removed from time and the material world. Why? Scientifically expressed, the fascinated subject immediately experiments various visual hallucinations as the focus of his eyes goes to a particular point called \"dark focus\" or \"resting point of focusing\". As your eyes focalize there, your mind goes in a sort of natural vacation and you do not recognise far and near any more. The \"dark focus\" is a phenomenon scientifically observed in aviators, who, sometimes, enter a sort of \"trance\", very dangerous while flying. It is like a physiological \"black point\", wired in our brain, where our perceptions change. This is a first difference with mainstream verbal hypnosis that, being psychologically oriented, does not rely on this kind of physiological reaction. A second change is also a natural and spontaneous development of catalepsy, similar to the tonic immobility of animals.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the hypnotic gaze induction can lead to a profound change in perception and induce various visual hallucinations. This method relies on a physiological reaction of the human brain, specifically the phenomenon of \"dark focus.\" It can also lead to natural catalepsy, a sense of charge, inner energy and wellbeing, and even complete body catalepsy, slowing of the heartbeat, and general anaesthesia. This technique does not require any verbal suggestion and can be a useful tool in accessing the inner part of our mind. However, caution must be exercised when using and exploring this method to avoid any potential risks."
