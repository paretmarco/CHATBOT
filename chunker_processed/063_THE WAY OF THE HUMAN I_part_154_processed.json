  "title": "\"What is the Thinking Dimension Exercise and how can it help you observe your thoughts?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores the impact of thoughts on our lives and how we can observe them to discard them. The author refers to teachings of influential figures such as Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj. In the final part (200 tokens) of the text, the author introduces an exercise that involves identifying the \"I thought\" and making it an object to be observed for introspection. The exercise can be done with a partner, where both individuals share their thoughts out loud while maintaining direct eye contact.",
  "content": "In this way we can observe them, see how they impact our life by constructing our internal subjective reality so that we can \"let it go\" or in Nisargadatta Maharaj's 88 ________________ Chapter VI words \"discard it.\" The process is as follows: Only when a thought arises ask yourself, \"To whom does this thought arise?\" Answer to yourself, \"To me.\" Then ask, \"Who is this I?\" This approach moves the \"I\" thought from being the subject (you), to making the \"I\" thought an object to be observed. The \"I thought\" will disappear and another \"I thought\" will appear and take its place. This process can be done with a partner. Pair up with partner. Make direct eye contact with them. Whenever a thought comes into the mind, the first person says it out loud. For example, \"I don't like it,\" \"I do like it,\" \"it'as hot,\" \"it's cold,\" \"I wish I weren't here,\" whatever the thought is.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing the technique of observing our thoughts and asking ourselves \"To whom does this thought arise?\" can be a powerful tool to cultivate mindfulness and detach from our internal subjective reality. By doing this, we can let go of negative thought patterns and allow new, positive ones to take their place, leading to a more peaceful and fulfilling life."
