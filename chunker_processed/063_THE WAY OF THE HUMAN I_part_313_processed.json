  "title": "What is the Way of the Human and how does Quantum Psychology approach therapy and training?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the limitations of guru-centered or technique-centered approaches and instead advocates for a human-centered approach to therapy and personal development. The Quantum Psychology principle emphasizes that therapists and teachers should not have their needs met by their clients or students. The Way of the Human involves seeing the body, mind, and spirit as one and the same substance, instead of compartmentalizing them. The author provides a demonstration involving dimensions and thoughts to highlight the importance of letting go of ideas and meaning placed upon experiences. The text concludes with a discussion on ideas about emotions, being alive, and sensations.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:I am going to go through the dimensions with you. So, tell me an idea that you have about the external world. Mark:The external is concrete. The external is some- thing we do. The external is something I need like money, a job, work, house, all of those things that give me security. Wolinsky:Those are interesting ideasâ€”what just happened? Therapeutic Note Once ideas are pointed out as ideas, they disappear. 198 That's an interesting idea too. Tell me another idea you have about emotions. Emotions are scary. That's an interesting idea. Some emotions are good and some emotions are bad. (With obvious humor) Obviously. Tell me an idea you have about being alive. That it requires work. That being alive requires a constant tracking of keeping it together. Tell me another idea you have about being alive. It's fun. There is a fun part to it. What's fun? This is fun. Tell me an idea you have about sensations. Sensations are uncomfortable. That's an interesting idea. Sensations tell me that something is going on with me. Sensations are scary.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, it's important to acknowledge and examine our ideas about the external world, emotions, being alive, and sensations. By recognizing them as just ideas, we can make them disappear and gain a better understanding of ourselves and our experiences. Through this process, we can improve our mental and emotional well-being."
