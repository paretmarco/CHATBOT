  "title": "\"How can we communicate effectively with different types of people and influence their behavior?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed how one can use role-playing to influence others by adopting hypnotic identities. In this concluding part, the author dives deeper into the types of people that one might encounter, such as the magnetic person, the dreamer, and the person experiencing a regression to an earlier age. The author explains how one can use the expectations and psychology of these individuals to guide them towards a certain path. The importance of understanding these phenomena has also been highlighted, as trans-national analysis has delved into the subject matter.",
  "content": "We might for instance get the “dreamer”, who, in hypnotic terms, should be translated as the kind of person that enacts a “time distortion” by living in an imaginary possible future. From his viewpoint, the present exists purely as an instrumental stepping stone to his dream. At that point, a person who is present might lead such individual wherever he wants, simply by getting in touch with the latter’s “dream”. The degree to which a person accepts our ideas is influenced by his expectation. By recourse to the look, we can eventually lead him into the present and help him plan things in an efficient manner. The regression to an earlier age One might likewise come across the kind of person who is experiencing a “regression to an earlier age”, and who will accordingly be inclined to behave like a child. This person, too, might be given assistance so that he can develop his potentialities, though, especially at the initial stage, we should try and understand his psychology and seemingly second his impulses. Trans-national analysis has examined this phenomenon.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the psychology of individuals and their behaviors is crucial in communicating ideas effectively. By identifying and addressing their mental states such as \"time distortion\" or \"regression to an earlier age,\" we can aid them in fulfilling their potential. Moreover, utilizing maternal or authoritative approaches can lead to efficient planning and cooperation resulting in a positive outcome."
