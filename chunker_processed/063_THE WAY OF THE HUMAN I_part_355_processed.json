  "title": "What is Trance-ference and Counter-Trance-ference in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author discusses the difference between being a teacher and a master. They explain that a true teacher is not fused with the concept of being a teacher, but rather simply presents material and teaches others what they know. The author warns against getting caught up in counter-trance-ference and trance-ference, where memories of a parent are transferred onto an authority figure or guru, leading to an adult operating out of a child identity. The text also touches on the creation of a spiritualized trance-ference metaphor.",
  "content": "Later on we will discuss how children create a hereafter or spiritualized trance-ference metaphor when their biological needs are not met. ________________ Special Section ence between being a TEACHER and simply presenting material and teaching another what you know. I remember, while being trained in Ericksonian Hypnosis, one trainer saw himself as my TEACHER. I explained to him that he was not my TEACHER, but rather that he was teaching me hypnosis. He did not understand the difference. In order to differentiate, if I teach you how to play guitar, I am your guitar teacher. But if I see myself as a MASTER and your TEACHER, then I could be in countertrance-ference/trance-ference with you. Unfortunately for everyone involved, all too often the teacher is fused with the TEACHER. In Quantum Psychology, a true teacher has neither a subjective experience of being a TEACHER, nor do they really want to be one. It is just what is happening. From a Quantum Psychology perspective, the best a true teacher can,,clo is to give you the tools to work on yourself. This is empowering another.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, understanding the difference between presenting material and being a true teacher is crucial to prevent counter-trance-ference in the teaching process. Quantum Psychology emphasizes the importance of empowering others rather than presenting oneself as a guru with all the answers. Recognizing idealization and other trance-ferences can also enhance personal growth. Later, we will delve into the interesting topic of how children create a hereafter or spiritualized trance-ference metaphor when their biological needs are not met."
