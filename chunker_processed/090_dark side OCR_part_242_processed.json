  "title": "\"How do our self-created structures rob us of understanding and how can we discover ourselves beyond them?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author explains how creating internal structures to handle chaos can rob us of understanding ourselves as the observers and creators of our experiences. They give an example of how lying to oneself can lead to victimization, and how admitting these lies can lead to vulnerability and interconnection. The author underscores the importance of acknowledging our internal realities and discovering ourselves as the observer and creator of our experiences. This is discussed in detail in their book, Quantum Consciousness: The Guide to Experiencing Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "In my case, the most powerful feeling of interconnection and unity with humanity I ever experienced was at my first Incest 148 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child Survivors Anonymous Group. Why? Because the lies I told myself and the pretending I played with others, in a moment of telling the truth, disappeared. It takes an immense amount of energy to hold back a secret and lie and pretend. When those lies are admitted as lies, the vulnerability and interconnection naturally occurs. This is the key point to remember. If our ultimate goal is to discover who we are, then the most important step is to look at our created internal realities, acknowledging their purpose, studying how they help us to resist or organize chaos. The final step is to discover ourselves as the observer and the creator of our internal images and experiences. This allows us to face ourselves more directly, and finally to break through beyond even the observer and the reality created by the observer. This is discussed and explored in detail in an experiential way in my book Quantum Consciousness: The Guide to Experienc- ing Quantum Psychology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, acknowledging and accepting our internal realities can lead us to discover our true selves and allow us to break through even our observer-created reality. Understanding the nervous system's way of organizing chaos through archetypes can help us make sense of our internal creation, leading to a deeper sense of interconnection and vulnerability with others."
