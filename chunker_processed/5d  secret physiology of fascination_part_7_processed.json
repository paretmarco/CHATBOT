  "title": "\"How Does Fixation of Attention and Blurring Affect Our Central and Peripheral Vision?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores how our eyes process information and how we can use this knowledge to enhance our fascination. The first part discusses how our accommodation is determined by texture gradient, and how certain movements can cause blurring in the peripheral field. The last part delves into the visual system, discussing central and peripheral vision and how they are responsible for object recognition and spatial orientation respectively. With this understanding, we can use peripheral vision to prepare the mind for the real fascination work.",
  "content": "There are two components of the visual system, focal (fovea) visionand ambient (peripheral) vision. Focal vision is primarily responsible for object recognition, and ambient vision is primarily responsible for spatial orientation. Peripheral vision is good at detecting motion (a feature of rod cells) so movement we do will be recognized and help in fascinating Focal Vision. Focal vision is limited to the central two degrees of vision (i.e., the fovea) and is primarily a conscious function. Focal vision allows one to see clearly in order to recognize objects and read displays. However, since it requires conscious thought, it is a relatively slow process. Focal vision is not primarily involved with orienting oneself in the environment, but can be used to acquire visual information about orientation. Â· Ambient Vision. Ambient vision is often referred to as peripheral vision. It is a subconscious function independent of focal vision whose primary role is to orient an individual in the environment. For example, one can fully occupy focal vision by reading (a conscious action), while simultaneously obtaining sufficient orientation cues with peripheral vision to walk (a subconscious function).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the two components of the visual system, focal and ambient vision, is essential to optimize the use of our sight ability. By altering binocular functions, such as practicing to observe very fast one eye after the other, one can expand their perception and go beyond the three-dimensional reality, which can be helpful in various tasks that require both conscious and subconscious functions."
