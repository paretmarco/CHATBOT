  "title": "How can the metaphor of a prism help us understand the concept of everything being made of the same substance?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explained the concept of the universe being made of one substanceâ€”NOTHINGNESS. The different physics dimensions and forces we know today are actually manifestations of this one substance. In this last part, the author uses the metaphor of a prism to explain the idea that everything is made of interactions of the physics dimensions and forces. The \"play\" or interaction of dimensions and forces is not a new idea, and the author explores this concept further.",
  "content": "Now, let us go back to our light-prism-rainbow metaphor and substitute the light with the NOTHINGNESS, and the prism with superstrings as the medium to form the Physics Dimensions. We could then say that the light was the NOTHING, superstring was the prism (medium contraction) and the rainbow the Physics dimensions. Therefore, it could be said that what we call archetypes and ultimately \"a personal me\" or \"a personal you,\" is actually a manifestation or a combination of the physics dimensions and forces (the rainbow) which are, ultimately, made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE or NOTHINGNESS. In this way, you could say that the \"you\" \"you\" call \"yourself,\" is a combination of interactions of the Physics dimensions and forces. Again, going back to our earlier metaphor of the prism (superstrings) and the physics dimensions (rainbow), we could say, metaphorically, we are a rainbow made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, which in appearance only imagines itself to be made of different substances. THE PLAY (INTERACTIONS) OF THE DIMENSIONS This idea of a \"play\" or interaction of the dimensions and forces is not new.",
  "last_phrase": "In essence, the archetypes and personal identities we associate ourselves with are merely a manifestation of the interactions between the physics dimensions and forces, all of which are made of the same substance of nothingness. This idea of a play of dimensions and forces is not new, as seen in the Hindu Yoga tradition. Ultimately, we are all subject to this play and interaction, including the physical form of a guru."
