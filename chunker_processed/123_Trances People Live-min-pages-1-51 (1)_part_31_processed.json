  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the Deep Trance Phenomenon as a coping mechanism in children that arises in response to specific stimuli, such as anger from a parent. Now, the author delves deeper into the concept, highlighting its ability to protect the child's integrity during development. The phenomenon represents different expressions of consciousness and is dependent on the child's experiences. As adults, individuals may continue to use this phenomenon to automatically respond to their environment, bringing their past experiences into the present. This text features the relevant concept of the Deep Trance Phenomenon and the prototypical child named in the text, as well as the author's discussion of how it functions.",
