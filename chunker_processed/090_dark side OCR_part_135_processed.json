  "title": "What is wonderfulizing and awfulizing? How do illusions and hallucinations relate to these thinking distortions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explained the concepts of wonderfulizing and awfulizing, which are thinking distortions related to cognitive therapy and trance. Now, the author provides real-life examples of how these illusions can negatively affect individuals and families. The first example is of a woman who was molested as a child and now, as an adult, perceives all men as potential abusers. The second example portrays how dysfunctional families may create an illusion of a perfect family, even though there are underlying issues such as alcoholism, abuse, and addiction. This section highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing these thinking distortions to achieve psychological well-being.",
  "content": "Illusions that initially had a specific, external trigger (like the uncle), become problems as the trance is generalized to all men. This process is stimulated by the inner child focusing on the trigger, the left eye. Another example is the woman who was molested as a child. The adult goes into a \"don't trust\" trance, even in an environment that is pleasant. Illusioning also is witnessed within families or 84 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child couples that co-create survival illusions together, keeping the family together. For example, a dysfunctional family might continually illusion themselves as fine, upstanding citizens and present themselves to the community that way. In many cases of incest or child abuse, the family creates this world view with a \"Father Knows Best\" illusion. In this television show, Jim was the perfect dad, little Kathy was a good girl, and Bud was a mischievous son. In real life, however, Jim was alcoholic and had several failed attempts at suicide. Kathy was sexually abused, and Bud had a drug addiction problem. Unfortu- nately, family members are asked to block out the uncomfortable and opt for the illusion of the positive image.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of our thoughts and the influence of our past experiences can lead us to distort reality and form illusions that shape our perception of the world. To avoid falling into this trap, it's important to expand our focus and see things as they really are, rather than being trapped by our inner child or relying on survival illusions. By doing so, we can gain a clearer understanding of ourselves, our relationships, and the world around us."
