  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the focus was on the fundamental exercise of proper breathing to use the lungs to their full capacity. In the last part of the text, the focus shifts towards the concept of the magnetic man and the exercises to develop the \"fascinative force.\" The magnetic man is described as someone who emanates a unique radiation and generates a feeling of well-being in those who approach him. The development of intuition through the opening of the third eye is also discussed. The text suggests two exercises to develop the fascinative force, which involves holding one's breath and performing physical movements.",
  "content": "First exhale all the air from lungs, and then inhale slowly through nostrils, keeping your mouth shut. Inhale as much air as possible, afterwards hold your breath This chapter is the transcription of a typescript given to us by Virgil while counting slowly up to five. Then exhale the air from the mouth and after a few seconds rest, repeat the exercise. You should try to repeat it three or four times holding the breath a bit longer every time. After three or four mornings, this exercise can be omitted, instead perform the following. Exercise 2 Put yourself in the above-mentioned position; exhale all the air from lungs and while inhaling, lift up your arms horizontally, holding them as rigid as you can. You must make sure that you spend the same time to put the arms at a right angle with the body, as it takes to enter the air in the lungs. Immediately after, raise your arms above the head as much as you can and look to the tip of the foot. Then bend yourself slowly until touching, if possible, the floor with fingertips, without bending the knees. Then set upright while you exhale the air from lungs, let fall arms along the body. This exercise can cause at first a feeling of dizziness, but there will not be inconveniences whatsoever. This is simply because some parts of the body, especially of the lungs, which remained inactive for a long time, are now put into use.",
