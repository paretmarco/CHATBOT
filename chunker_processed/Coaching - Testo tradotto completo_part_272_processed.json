  "title": "\"What is Reverse Visualization and how can it improve our daily, weekly, and yearly planning?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author explains the importance of conducting a critical review of our daily activities in order to improve our future plans. They suggest reflecting on the day, week, month, and year, and examining our actions without being influenced by external judgments. They also introduce a useful exercise of \"reverse visualization,\" where one looks back on their day from the last event to the first, to better understand the extent of their freedom. The author notes that practicing this exercise can also improve our memory retention.",
  "content": "Every evening, without fail, our daily activity should be examined on the basis, not on the judgment of the outside world, but rather on the judgment which is dictated by our own consciousness. Such consciousness must be essentially non-emotional, and rather directed at the discovery of new solutions and spaces for all those instances in which we have lost self-consciousness and we have “forgotten” what we truly wanted to achieve. Exercise 50 – A most useful exercise consists in what is called “reverse visualization”. In essence, we look at our day backwards, moving from the last event of that day back to the first one. By moving backwards, we will realize the extent to which we were actually free even though we were failing to realize that truth. The exercise might be conducted over longer periods, such as a full week. NB: The repeated implementation of this exercise also produces an improvement in our memory.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing the reverse visualization exercise on a daily or weekly basis can lead to better memory and critical examination of our daily activities with a spirit of rectification. By looking at our day backwards, we can discover new solutions, spaces, and freedom for achieving our goals. The thorough interrogative examination and schematic annotations form a stable and standard analysis, helping us learn from the past to guide our present actions."
