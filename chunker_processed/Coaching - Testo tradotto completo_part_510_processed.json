  "title": "\"How can developing financial intuition improve trading success and what is its connection to human physiology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the nature of financial markets and the human behavior that affects them. It explains that deterministic theories cannot fully account for the diversity of factors that shape the markets, nor can they allow traders to logically analyze market variables in real time. Instead, traders who succeed over the long term develop intuitive acumen, which involves opening oneself up to new possibilities and solutions. The text suggests that a state of mental opening is essential to the development of financial intuition and that negative emotions can hinder this process. By cultivating a more intuitive mode of thinking, traders may be better able to navigate financial markets and achieve superior results.",
  "content": "In order to develop such intuitive acumen, we need to understand that our mind has two ways in which it functions: 1. A linear way 2. A second mode of functioning, which might be called \"intuitive\", or alternatively \"quantistic\". If we succeed in making the mind work in accordance with the said second mode, we might then be able to naturally reproduce the mental mechanism which governs superior achievers. Opening oneself up to intuition A prerequisite to financial intuition manifesting is a state of mental opening; it is in fact important that we should surmount the negative emotions, as they would otherwise pile upon our inner sensations, thereby screening the latter from our view. It is important that we should be “larger” than problems and situations. What matters is never the dimension of the problem. What matters is your own mental dimension. If you perceive a problem as huge is only because you are small. Or as it is also put: “If every thing seems to you to be blue, you should change your pair of glasses”115. It is only at such point that we might open ourselves up to something more, to what represents a plus.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to tap into financial intuition, we must learn to quiet our negative emotions and open our minds to the possibility of a deeper understanding. Intuition is a natural phenomenon that can be observed through non-verbal communication and can improve brainwave coherence. By embracing intuition as a powerful tool, we can unlock new solutions and achieve superior results."
