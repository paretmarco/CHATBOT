  "first_phrase": "In this text, we witness a therapeutic session between Debra, Wolinsky, and John. Before the final part, Debra and John have a conversation where Debra tries to make John her reflection. However, John isn't interested, and Debra starts feeling that she's not worth anything. In the concluding 200 tokens, Wolinsky explains how narcissism works and the pain that ensues when the reflection doesn't occur. Debra, still feeling hurt, responds by saying she'll pretend to be what John wants and even meditate with him.",
  "content": "________________ Therapeutic Note In all narcissistic situations, you become the other person's reflection so that they will become your reflection. When that does not occur, pain in the form of anger, etc., ensues. Debra:John, now that you are not being my reflection, I feel betrayed. Wolinsky:Okay, keep going. Debra:John, since you are not now being my reflection, I must have done something wrong or it was that I have no value, I'm just not worth it. Wolinsky:John, since you are not my reflection in exchange Debra:John, so you won't know or see that I'm not worthfor me being your reflection, I feel (fill in the it, I'll just do a lot of pretending. I'll be what youblank). want. I'll even meditate with you. Wolinsky:I'm going to change the language. John, I became your reflection so that (fill in the blank). Therapeutic Note Here we are going into her narcissism. Debra: Wolinsky: John, since you are not my reflection in exchange for me being your reflection, I feel hurt. It's not fair.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize and address any narcissistic tendencies in relationships to avoid the pain and hurt that can result from trying to make someone else your reflection. It's necessary to understand that everyone has inherent value and worth, and no one should have to pretend or change themselves to please someone else."
