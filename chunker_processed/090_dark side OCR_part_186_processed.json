  "title": "\"How Can Understanding the Inner Child's Past and Sensory Distortion Help in Present Relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding part, we explore the power of opening up to the past and the consequences of denying it. The author explains how amnesia and hypermnesia can affect an individual's ability to fully remember or forget unpleasant events. By removing the barrier of not knowing, one can access forgotten knowledge and enrich their present experiences. Additionally, sensory distortion is explored as a defensive mechanism that creates numbness, hypersensitivity, or pain in response to past trauma. Recognizing and addressing these distortions can help individuals expand their focus and achieve a more fulfilling present life.",
  "content": "\"Working Class Hero\" John Lennon Sensory distortion is a trance state experienced as numbness, pain, dullness, or as the opposite, hypersensitivity. Three types of sensory distortion include: 1. Emotional sensory distortion: is a defense to protect the observer creates numbness within the child. For example, the child develops numbness during an inci- dent of child abuse. Years later the child within the adult develops a numbness or lack of sexual sensations. 2. Hypersensitivity occurs when someone is overly sensi- tive to the world. For example, an individual walks into 118 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child a room and the child within the adult imagines every- one is talking about him or someone shows up 15 minutes late and the child within personalizes it, think- ing, \"Why me?\" 3. Sensory distortion and pain is a trance that shrinks the focus of attention to only the pained area. For example, if a person has a headache, the attention of the indi- vidual is focused on the head. The goal would be to expand the focus of attention to include the whole body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's essential to become aware of your own sensory distortions, which can manifest as numbness, hypersensitivity, or pain. Identifying the type of distortion is the first step in dismantling the automatic response of the inner child and awakening the observer. By working on yourself and expanding your focus, you can combat sensory distortions and achieve a sense of balance and well-being. As John Lennon said, \"You're just a working-class hero, but you have to do the work.\""
