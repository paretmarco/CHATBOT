  "title": "\"What is Instant Rapport and how can NLP techniques, including mirroring and the Enneagram, help us achieve it and improve our communication skills?\"",
  "first_phrase": "NLP, or neuro-linguistic programming, offers strategies for successful communication in all aspects of life. This approach involves understanding and exploring new ways of thinking and living. The technique of mirroring, where a person unconsciously mirrors the body movements of another, can be used to create a rapport with anyone. This technique can be particularly useful in clinical interviews, sales or conversations. The last 200 tokens of the text discuss the various NLP techniques and how one's beliefs and attitudes can limit success.",
  "content": "By way of mirroring, we send back to the interlocutor, with our behavior, the same way of behaving that belongs to his/ her pattern of the world. You become a mirror of the other, for example: legs crossed during a conversation, fingers of one hand entwined with the other. This is carried out until you arrive at the same tone of voice and level of breathing, which are two of the most powerful mirrors. It is enough to think of a baby that sleeps in the arms of its mother because her breathing makes it feel safe. All this is perceived by the unconscious of our interlocutor as similarity and/ or affinity. It is amazing how “brick walls” can be brought down if we learn to listen, observe and feel others. Mirroring means entering into harmony with respect and delicacy without invading or annoying. This method has the advantage of creating a rapport, without necessarily knowing the way which the individual lives his/ her life or sharing it. To have this ability can, for example, positively affect a clinical interview, a school test, a sale or a simple discussion. Some examples of things to mirror are: Posture: Is it tense or relaxed? Is the body leaning forwards or backwards? How are the hands, arms and legs placed? Breathing: Is his/ her breathing thoracic or abdominal? Is the rhythm slow, quick or calm? With what intensity is s/he breathing (Deep or shallow)? Movements: What are his/ her gestures? What does s/he do with the hands?",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, non-verbal communication is a powerful tool for establishing rapport and understanding others. Mirroring, paying attention to posture, breathing, and other non-verbal cues can help create harmony with respect and delicacy. Additionally, understanding representational or sensorial systems and person types, such as the Communicational Enneagram, can aid in better communication both personally and professionally. By utilizing these methods, we can improve our ability to connect with others and create meaningful relationships."
