  "title": "\"What are some ideas and perceptions about the concept of 'diffuse' and how it affects our functioning?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the conversation between Wolinsky and Mark was focused on the idea of being diffuse and its negative connotations. However, after exploring the concept, they concluded that diffuse is just a word and that it should not prevent someone from functioning properly. In this final section, Wolinsky guides Mark through the exploration of his emotional responses to different situations. By breaking down negative associations and ideas, they aim to develop multi-dimensional awareness.",
  "content": "It feels good sometimes. It is necessary. Sometimes it is an inconvenience. It has a lot of bad connotations. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea you have about shitting. Oh, that it is dirty or that it is part of the body. I can hear my mother saying, wishing I didn't do that. Sort of like it is something wrong. The Way of the Human • Developing Multi-Dimensional AwarenessChapter VIII Mark:You can't function when you are diffuse.Mark:Clear—great. Wolinsky:How does diffuse seem to you now?Therapeutic Note We went all the way down through the biology. Now whenever you Mark:It seems just like a word.are working with yourself or another person, and someone comes to you and says, \"I feel sad but I don't want to feel sad,\" you can say, Wolinsky:How does your experience seem to you right now? \"Tell me an idea about sad. Tell me another idea about sad. Tell me another idea.\" You want to blow out the idea. Sadness is not a prob- Mark:Clear. There is a starting to become clear but stilllem.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that our ideas and judgments shape our experiences, and sometimes this can cause discomfort or inconvenience. However, by removing our labels and simply experiencing sensations as they are, we can develop a more holistic and aware sense of self. Remember to always question your ideas and seek new perspectives, even when it comes to something as universally taboo as shitting."
