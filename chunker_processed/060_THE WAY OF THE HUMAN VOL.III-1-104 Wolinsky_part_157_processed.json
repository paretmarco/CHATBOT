  "first_phrase": "This text explores the Quantum Psychology Principle that being present in the now means being in no-time-now. It discusses the \"Not-I-I\" and how the belief that reasons are necessary only perpetuates the structure of the \"I.\" The last part delves into the idea that the external, thinking, emotional, and biological dimensions are interdependent. The conversation with Michael Wolinsky includes concepts about energy, solidness, space, and time.",
  "content": "Tell me another concept you have about the concept of energy. It moves things and people. That's an interesting idea. Are there any other concepts about the concept of energy? No. Tell me a concept about the concept of solidness? Solidness pulsates. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another concept about the concept of solidness. Solidness comes and goes. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another concept about the concept of solidness. There aren't any. Tell me a concept about the concept of space. It's full. Okay, that's an interesting idea. Tell me another concept you have about the concept of space. It's empty. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another concept you have about the concept of space. ________________ Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Woiinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Woiinsky: Michael: ________________ It pulsates.
