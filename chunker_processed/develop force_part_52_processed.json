  "title": "What are the exercises for awakening the central fire and developing inner power?",
  "first_phrase": "This text presents a series of exercises focused on developing inner power and awakening the central fire within ourselves. The idea is to detach from physical senses and isolate ourselves from the physical world in order to project energy and awaken magnetism. One exercise involves focusing on a mirror, while another requires imagining a sign and following a continuous curve. The final exercise focuses on breathing to dominate polarities. The aim is to balance the breathing through alternating inhaling and exhaling with each nostril. These exercises can help to develop concentration, attention, and balance within ourselves.",

It occurs only when \"our Center will know how to move into the fluidic body and will be detached from primary senses and isolated, as a result, from the physical world\". Indeed, to perform the exercise, you shall develop a new status in yourself, detached from physical senses. Then the fire of consciousness D can afford to project the energy. This projection may be accompanied by a specific sound (mantra). You are awakening magnetism. This will be fixed later by subsequent repetitions of the exercise and its evocation through memory, even without water. Physically and symbolically. The use of the symbol in our tradition coincides with a reality. The second is the projection of the force in itself. Abraxa â€“ Ur and Krur Breathing to dominate the polarities Our breathing, without we notice it, passes alternately from one nostril to the other. The researcher Ernest Rossi observed that this alternation of rhythms follows specific rhythms and matches the different activation of the two cerebral hemispheres. Symbolically, the right nostril is linked to activity, while the left to passivity. A balancing exercise is alternating breathing in, namely the inhale with one nostril and exhale with the other. 81: breathing exercise. 1) Inhale right while holding (closing) the left nostril and fill the lungs 1) Exhale left holding (closing) the right nostril.",
