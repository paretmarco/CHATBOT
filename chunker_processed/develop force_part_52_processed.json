  "first_phrase": "This text delves into various exercises aimed at developing inner power and fascination along with their symbolic values. Previous exercises like grounding and focusing on the aura are briefly discussed before moving onto exercises that awaken the central fire and help achieve inter-hemispheric coordination. The significance of the symbolic elements used in these exercises is discussed and the importance of breathing to dominate polarities is emphasized. The text concludes with a breathing exercise involving alternating nostrils.",
  "content": "Process The first phase of the awakening of the serpent power (namely basic energy, symbolized by the symbol of Aries A, serpentine energy linked to the deeper layers of our mind). It occurs only when \"our Center will know how to move into the fluidic body and will be detached from primary senses and isolated, as a result, from the physical world\". Indeed, to perform the exercise, you shall develop a new status in yourself, detached from physical senses. Then the fire of consciousness D can afford to project the energy. This projection may be accompanied by a specific sound (mantra). You are awakening magnetism. This will be fixed later by subsequent repetitions of the exercise and its evocation through memory, even without water. Physically and symbolically. The use of the symbol in our tradition coincides with a reality. The second is the projection of the force in itself. Abraxa â€“ Ur and Krur Breathing to dominate the polarities Our breathing, without we notice it, passes alternately from one nostril to the other. The researcher Ernest Rossi observed that this alternation of rhythms follows specific rhythms and matches the different activation of the two cerebral hemispheres. Symbolically, the right nostril is linked to activity, while the left to passivity. A balancing exercise is alternating breathing in, namely the inhale with one nostril and exhale with the other. 81: breathing exercise. 1) Inhale right while holding (closing) the left nostril and fill the lungs 1) Exhale left holding (closing) the right nostril.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the exercises presented here aim to awaken the serpent power and increase personal influence through the development of mental images and the use of light. The process involves developing a detached state from physical senses, practicing alternating breathing, and honing in on the \"near-far\" glance technique. These exercises, coupled with a heightened level of awareness, can lead to health benefits and even the ability to change behaviors and inveterate habits. It may take time and effort to master these techniques, but the results are worth it."
