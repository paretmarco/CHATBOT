  "title": "\"How do energy exchanges and judgments from external sources impact one's perception of self?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this therapeutic session with Robert Wolinsky, he encourages Barbara to remove the label of judgment from her father and allow it to go back to its source. By doing so, Barbara is able to acknowledge that her grief stems from seeking attention to feel like she exists. Wolinsky explains the concept of giving energy to receive energy, which can be traced back to Barbara's relationship with her mother. As Barbara practices this exercise, she finds it to be a fun experience.",
  "content": "Is that judgment from your father? Barbara:It's coming from my father who is in the corner. Therapeutic Note A pure being as ESSENCE or I AM does not judge itself. Therefore, it had to have come from something \"outside\" of her. The only question is Who? Wolinsky:So have an image of your father over there and take the label off of it and have it as energy, and allow that judging energy to go back to its source, i.e., your father. A lot of grief is about that. Say that to me. A lot of my grief is putting my attention on her so something comes back about her to me so I can feel like I exist. ________________ Barbara: Wolinsky: Barbara: Wolinsky: ________________ I can do that. How are you doing now? Just here. How does this feel? You had to give energy to your mother so that she would give energy to you so that you would exist. It's kind of fun in a way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing that our self-judgments can come from external sources, and separating them from our true essence can help us let go of the illusion of non-existence and find inner peace. By allowing the judging energy to go back to its source and acknowledging our own deception, we can move forward on the way of being human."
