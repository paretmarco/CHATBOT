  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this letter, Ellis explains how the trances that adults enter due to their painful experiences in childhood can continue to affect them even in their present-day relationships. Many adults develop an ability to disconnect and create trances to avoid emotional pain. However, when this ability becomes automatic, it can negatively impact their ability to feel sensations and create problems in relationships, work, or school. Ellis uses examples of physical numbness, sexual dysfunction and even amnesia, to describe the serious implications of these trances.",
  "content": "Men could suffer from premature ejaculation or impotency. It must be understood that the trance a child created is actually an ability or skill that was developed to handle painful situations. The problem occurs when the ability to create a trance gets out of control, and the individual finds himself reacting automatically. The trance of the child within the adult automatically creates the same state of numbness even though the adult might not want to be 10 â€¢ The Dark Side of the inner Child numb in the present-time relationship. All this occurs while the observer sleeps. For example, a woman I worked with was so badly spanked by her father that from the waist down she was numb. This affected her sexual relationship with her husband. She could not feel \"sexual\" sensations, and had an inability to achieve orgasm. A psychologist I saw for therapy is another example. He had had an incestuous relationship with his sister. Years later in his marriage, the child within his adult world \"went numb.\" The presenting problem: the ability to have an erection. If you experience yourself reacting emotionally or verbally on \"automatic,\" you might be experiencing an hypnotic trance sug- gested by the child within the adult.",
  "last_phrase": "Understanding the impact of the inner child's trance on an adult's behavior and experience can help identify and address unwanted patterns. Working with a therapist to explore therapeutic trance states can be a valuable tool in healing and moving forward in relationships and sexual experiences."
