  "content": "The most amazing thing was that a certain percentage was healed completely at the first session, after less of a minute of therapy. These are our masters in teaching us these centuries' old techniques that they were still practising. Some of these visual patterns had never been diffused up to now. To begin this travel in the realm of the eye, the first point to develop in your daily practice is your ability of staring. Being able to stare without feeling the need to blink is a powerful and basic asset for exerting all other variants of gaze exposed hereunder. Why do we need to exercise staring without blinking? There are many interpersonal as well personal reasons behind it. This behaviour has been confirmed to be very useful even by modern researches. For example researcher Argyle pointed out that people feeling themselves inferior blink more often than people feeling themselves superior. The blinking patterns are also connected to the fact that our brain is performing subconscious processing. As we blink we are changing \"mental image\". So the more nervous a person is, the more often he/she will blink. If we are able not to blink we will transmit the idea to be sure and firm.",

Not only can it give us a sense of confidence and calmness, but it can also help us achieve one-pointedness of mind and enhance our focus and concentration. So, let's start practicing this basic yet powerful asset to harness the full potential of our gaze and achieve a stronger body-mind connection."
