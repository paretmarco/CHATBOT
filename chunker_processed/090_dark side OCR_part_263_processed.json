  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, Stephen is shown exploring the power of non-verbal communication and gestures with his patients in therapy. He helps people identify the precise triggers that elicit certain emotional responses. In the last part (200 tokens), Stephen is seen working with a drug abuser who struggles with feelings of unworthiness when interacting with others. Stephen prompts the patient to identify the exact part of a person's face and body that triggers these feelings, opening up new possibilities for the patient to overcome his emotional challenges.",
  "content": "\"When I meet somebody, I always feel like they reject me. I feel I am less than them, that I am unworthy.\" The man talked about going to the herb store before the session. There was a man behind the counter he knows. He moved in front of the man, and he started to feel unworthy, like he had to impress him. So what did I write down? \"Unworthy, impressâ€”I'm not good enough,\" which was his inner dialogue. I asked, \"What triggers this response, what about this man at the herb store triggers this? Is it his posture, is it the way his legs are? Is it the way his mouth is held? Nose? Is he looking away? Is his neck turned? What is it?\" Patient:\"His eyes.\" Stephen: \"His left eye or his right eye?\" Patient:\"His left eye.\" Stephen: \"What part of his left eye?\" Patient:\"The part that wrinkles below the eye.\" Stephen: \"What part of the face do you imagine is most accepting? Which eye?\"",
  "last_phrase": "If you struggle with feelings of unworthiness and rejection when meeting someone new, it may be helpful to break down the situation and understand what triggers those emotions. By analyzing specific cues, such as facial expressions or body language, you can start to shift your inner dialogue and focus on the parts of the face that convey acceptance and love. Don't let negative self-talk hold you back from connecting with others."
