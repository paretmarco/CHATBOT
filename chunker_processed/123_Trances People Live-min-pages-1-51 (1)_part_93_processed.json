  "title": "\"How can hypnosis help alleviate chronic pain caused by sexual trauma?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses a therapeutic approach to help a woman who had chronic back pain as a result of sexual abuse. The author, whose name is not given, explores how the woman created a traumatic response during sexual situations by focusing solely on the sensations in her back and dissociating from the experience. The author reverses this pattern by expanding the woman's sense of her body as a unified organism through hypnosis and reconnecting the sensations in her back to the rest of her body. As a result, the woman was able to embrace her problem area and alleviate her chronic pain. The last 200 tokens focus on evoking a vivid experience of a resource in the client's body and expanding its connection outside of her.",
  "content": "Next, 1 worked with her to bring this expanded body context into rela- tionship with her sense of self: \"And as you continue to feel the sensations in your pelvis and tower back, I wonder how long it would take for the sensations to move...move...move into your chest, arms, neck, and head. . .not to mention your legs and feet.\" These suggestion.sconnect the pelvic and lower back sensations to the whole body so that the figure (the pelvis) is no longer disconnected from the ground (the body). Next I asked for an image that would reconnect her sense of self, her \"1-ness,\" to her body: Cr•ming Context • 67 and feeling and hearing Mount Vesuvius right inside your heart. ** Now that a resource has been evoked and vividly experienced rhys;cany, in tilt body, I wait to expand its connection outside of Ir image simultaneously inside me as well the client to embrace, eventually, her problem area.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by reconnecting the client's sense of self to her body through expanding the body context and evoking a vivid resource, the problem areas can be approached with a renewed perspective. This technique allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of ourselves, others, and the world around us, providing a practical tool for personal growth and healing."
