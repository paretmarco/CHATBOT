The demo will be divided into two parts, with the first part introducing the concept of Non-Verbal Hypnotism and the second part focusing on inducing a hypnotic state when the person reacts to certain stimuli. Prior to this, the text explores Magnetic Circle, Proxemics, Paralinguistics, Gaze, Magnetic Passes and Gestures, and the benefits of Closure of the Senses and the 10 Plexuses Techniques. The latter part is a summary of the Advanced Course conducted in Russia, which explores Quantum and Hermetic Paradigms, exercises of self-hypnosis, and techniques to induce ECSTASY.",
  "content": "A circle will feel him as you are \"around\" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also \"proxemics\" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises and techniques can be useful for therapists and individuals looking to explore deeper levels of self-awareness and hypnosis. The techniques include using proxemics near and far, small sounds, magnetic passes, and non-verbal induction. The Trabona Method and Modified Akstein Method can be used for self-hypnosis. The importance of incorporating both nervous/psychological and metabolic reasons in weight loss was emphasized, and a deep understanding of magnetic types was discussed. It is important to remember the sacredness of magnetism and to be present in the moment while practicing these techniques."
