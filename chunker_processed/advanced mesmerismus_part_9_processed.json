  "content": "A circle will feel him as you are \"around\" him ALSO Do small sounds Use proxemics near and far See what happens Look for reactions After wake up INTERPRETATION OF THE WORK ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE INDIVIDUAL Neurological interpretation The Right side is Rational The Left side is Emotional Psychological interpretation Sometimes right is the father and left the mother because habitudinary these two figures develop these attitudes but for sure we can say Emotion/Rational Beging giving stimulation to the subject. You will approach and go backward. At the same time you turn around him Interpretation of the reactions: May be stronger reaction on the right (or on the left) is linked to the psychological interpretation we saw before. Reaction to the Front can be confrontation Notice how people react when you use also \"proxemics\" (going near and far) Turning around remind us of a circle Sounds are slow or fast. Remember to stop sometimes in your movements GENERAL RULE When you see a reaction stay there and see if increases Step 2 in this exercise Introduce magnetic passes (not a lot, just to see reaction) OR try catalepsy with the head (or the arm) IMPORTANT This technique is very easy but you must be perceived positively. For doing that you must be perceived as positive symbol In therapy in general if a person comes to you is because she perceives you positively In general remember that people will give emotional value to people that is able to raise their emotions As a general rule you should have: PRESENCE and if you want higher reactions have also people speaking of their emotions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the techniques discussed in these exercises can be used to stimulate unconscious responses and create emotional reactions. Small sounds, proxemics, and magnetic passes can be used to evoke reactions in the individual, and hypnodrama and movements can be employed for self-hypnosis. It is essential to be perceived as a positive symbol to the client and maintain a neutral stance. Magnetic voice and fluidification can improve the efficacy of magnetic therapy. Specific techniques for weight loss, and the use of water and incorporation in self-hypnosis were also explored. Through understanding the magnetic types of the body, we can effectively communicate and stimulate each organ's responses, making magnetism a powerful tool in healing."
