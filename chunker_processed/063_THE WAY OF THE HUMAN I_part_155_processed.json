  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed a process to observe the \"I\" thought and make it an object to be observed. Continuing from there, this final section features a dialogue between a student and the author, \"I,\" where the student seeks an answer to the question, \"Who is this IT?\" through self-inquiry. The author explains how the thought disappears, and we are left with pure awareness. The discussion emphasizes the importance of self-inquiry in recognizing the true nature of the self.",
  "content": "The second person, sitting opposite asks the question, \"To whom does this thought arise?\" The first person responds \"To me,\" and the second then asks \"Who is this IT' A student asked, \"Is there an answer to the question, 'Who is this IT\" \"I\" replied, \"To whom does that thought arise called, Is there an answer to the question?\" \"To me,\" she replied. I then asked, \"Who is this IT' She said, \"The thought disappeared.\" When a thought comes into your mind, ask, \"To whom does that thought arise?\" Answer, \"To me.\" Ask, \"Who is this I?\" A student once said, \"I don't think I know what I'm doing.\" \"I\" asked him, \"To whom does that thought arise?\" He answered, \"To me.\" I, asked, \"Who is this I?\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by questioning the origin of our thoughts, we can break free from limiting beliefs and discover the space of pure consciousness beyond the \"I\". Remember, anything you identify with only serves to limit you, so always ask yourself, \"To whom does this thought arise?\" and find freedom in the answer."
