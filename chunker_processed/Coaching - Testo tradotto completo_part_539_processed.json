  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we explored the concept of will and how it enables us to set limits on our actions and coordinate them with our goals. Now, we delve into the practical applications of this idea through the use of a life plan. By focusing on the present day and having a plan that aligns with our ideals, we create opportunities to fully exploit the power of our minds and enjoy life to the fullest. This last section will discuss how to make use of a life plan and how it can guide us towards our desired destination, even if we need to adjust it along the way.",
  "content": "Coordinating one’s will = Substituting intended mental representations for the impulsive type thereof Will = Coordinating one’s ideas Educating one’s will does not bear any other connotation than training ourselves on how to gradually replace impulsive and dispersive actions with the ideo-determined type which are harmoniously in line with the Universe. Opportunities Having a plan, therefore, is paradoxically of helpful assistance to the effort of being in the now, and being in time as opposed to see it passing by. Opportunities can only be discovered by being anchored in the NOW. The purpose behind the formulation of a plan is to know what we have to do today, without any need to think about tomorrow. The plan will accordingly be all the more valid if it enables us to focus on the present day 117. It is only in this way that we might fully exploit the power of the mind, have the chance of discovering the opportunities provided by life, and enjoy them to their fullest. How to make use of the life plan The life plan can only be a direction enabling us to get to where we would like to go. It might happen that one is forced or eager to change it, wholly or partly.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, educating our wills through a life plan is a helpful tool in shaping our impulsive actions into harmonious ones that align with the Universe. By focusing on the present day and opportunities that arise, we can make the most of our lives. Whether we need to adjust our life plan or break it down into shorter time spans, we can use it as a direction to move towards our goals and analyze ourselves as individuals and part of a larger community. Creating a plan for the next day or future activity is a crucial step in this process."
