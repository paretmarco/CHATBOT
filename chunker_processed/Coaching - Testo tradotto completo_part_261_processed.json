  "title": "\"How can we achieve true happiness through desires and planning?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article delves into the nature of desires and the importance of being present in the moment for true happiness. The author emphasizes the idea that joy is not found in things, but in our organic receptiveness to the present. The final 200 tokens explain the necessity of subdividing life plans into secondary plans to execute necessary actions during various stages of life. The author also discusses the idea of breaking down yearly plans into monthly, weekly, and daily plans to correspondingly become more concrete and related to the needs of the moment.",
  "content": "Secondary plans and subordinate plans We will thus get a first differentiation between the execution of the operations which we will need to carry out during a specific period of our existence, whence the imperative requirement of subdividing the general life plan into several secondary plans that are subordinated to it and in which alone — we ought to reiterate — they find their entire reason of being. As we have stated earlier, one can extrapolate from the whole plan a smaller portion which is limited to the execution of a particular program, one which is circumscribed, that is, to the specific necessities associated with a given stage of our life. That does not detract from the enduring benefit and logic of an annual subdivision of the general plan, which retains therefore an essential role. Moreover, as the year comprises its own natural subdivisions, the subdivisions into months, weeks and days, we are going to break down the yearly plan, in turn, to monthly, weekly and daily plans. As they narrow down, these plans are going to correspondingly find their concrete actualization, thereby becoming progressively more subdivided into actions which are related to the needs of the moment.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, the key to achieving our goals lies in dividing our life plan into secondary and subordinate plans that are linked to it. By breaking down larger plans into smaller ones and linking them strategically to one another, we can create feasible daily plans and attain our objectives with the help of tactics, strategies, and intuition."
