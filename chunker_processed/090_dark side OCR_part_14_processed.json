  "first_phrase": "The Dark Side of the Inner Child is a chapter in this book on quantum psychology. The author explains that each one of us has multiple inner children with varied perceptions, world views, etc. One such inner child can have a dark side, resulting in distorted lenses when experiencing the world. The book aims to help readers understand and release inner-child memories that are limiting them. The author rejects traditional therapies that change inner-child views and proposes observer-awakening in quantum psychology. In this last part, the reader will learn how the observer can let go of the memory by awakening and taking control.",
  "content": "Many Prologue : therapies would at that point introduce a new belief, for example, \"It's okay to trust men,\" or, \"People do love me.\" The intention of these therapies is to \"heal the inner child.\" What I propose is dramatically different. Quantum Psychology The first tenet of Quantum Psychology is that subjective, internal reality is observer-created. You, as the observer of a trauma, take a picture of it, hold it, merge with it, go to sleep, and then go on the same tape-loop ride over and over again. Quantum Psychology says that you, (the observer), hold and create the inner-child memory in response to a trauma. To clarify, the observer does not create the outer event. The ob- server creates it's response to the outer event. Therefore, the observer, who has fallen asleep and fused with the memory, must be awakened so that the memory can be let go of by the ob- server. That picture that is given the power is a memory that you (the observer) are holding.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a fresh perspective on trauma and memory by empowering the observer rather than the memory. By awakening the observer from the unconscious loop of reliving the traumatic event, we can let go of the power we give to memories, and free ourselves from the pain they cause. It is a powerful tool that can help us move forward and create a better future for ourselves."
