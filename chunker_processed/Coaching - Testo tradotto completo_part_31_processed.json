  "title": "How can light help us tap into our creativity and uniqueness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the importance of seizing our own uniqueness and establishing a deeper understanding of ourselves. Now, we will delve into the use of light as a tool for occasioning man's development. The ancient Zoroastrians practiced praying by gazing at fire, a method that science has yet to properly study and unveil. Recent research shows that light can facilitate the maximum excitement of neurons and even create a state of development of creativity. We will attempt to explain the usefulness of light using modern quantum theory and how every sense works like a lens to refocus in certain ways, making it difficult to regain access to the whole.",
  "content": "Physical light is thus a FACILITATOR, and as such it “multiplies” what is already present in the mind. In order to attempt an explanation of the usefulness which light is regaled with, we are presently going to resort to a series of reflections based on modern quantum theory. The Universe is a whole. From this whole, our perception “excises” some parts. The parts thus severed from the whole correspond to certain vibrational states of our neurons. In order to see a tree, for instance, the neurons of the visual cortex must be activated in a manner which is different from the one that is needed when, to give an example, we discern a mountain. This very same concept is also at the heart of Pribram and Bohm’s holonomic theory: \"Every sense works like a lens, and thus refocuses the visual waves both by perceiving specific elements which are reiterated so as to establish an underpinning basis, and by perceiving distinct quantities. If we were to take the lenses off, only a hologram would be left”. Given that every sense works by refocusing in accordance with certain mechanisms, it is very difficult to regain access to the WHOLE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of physical light as a facilitator that multiplies what is already present in our minds can make it easier for us to perceive the world around us. By grasping the idea that every object is already present in white light, we can expand our perception and regain access to the totipotent whole of reality. These reflections based on modern quantum theory can help us appreciate the amazing potential of light in enhancing our experiences of the world."
