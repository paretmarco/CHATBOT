  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author discusses the importance of the skeletal system and its relation to our ability to be present in the moment and act without interference. The author notes that fear and societal conditioning can cause us to lose this clarity of organization, resulting in a false self. In the final 200 tokens of the text, the author brings it back to their practice of the Feldenkrais method, where they have found that their clients often hold tension due to a lack of awareness of their biological core. The focus is on understanding the underlying issues causing tension and discomfort, rather than simply treating symptoms.",
  "content": "The person, sensing the inner collapse, produces a masked state of the musculature to control the appearance to the outside world, and to provide some sense of control and security given the loss of the inner core. Thus a False Self is created. In my practice of the Feldenkrais work [ often find that the central issue behind a person's complaints is the lack of awareness of their BIOLOGICAL CORE in the sense in which I have described it above. My clients, however, do not usually come to find a new center. They complain of holding tension in their shoulders and neck, or between the shoulder blades, or in the lower back.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize that the creation of a False Self through musculature masking is a common response to the loss of inner core and lack of awareness. While addressing specific complaints of tension may be necessary, it is crucial to ultimately focus on finding and reconnecting with the biological core to achieve true control and security in both one's inner and outer selves. To do so, consider exploring Feldenkrais work or other practices for enhanced bodily awareness."
