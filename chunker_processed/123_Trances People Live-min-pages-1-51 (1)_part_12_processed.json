  "title": "\"What is the new role of hypnotherapists in treating Deep Trance Phenomena as symptoms?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The first part of this chapter establishes that the role of a hypnotherapist is not to induce a trance but to de-hypnotize the individual from their current trance. In the remainder, the author explores a new perspective on the experience of trance by delving into Deep Trance Phenomena, which underlie a vast array of adult experiences. They then present a few everyday examples of how this works, such as anxiety being a fear of the future. The text focuses on the way a client utilizes various Deep Trance Phenomena to experience anxiety, and how this phenomenon can be reinforced by negative hallucinations, positive hallucinations, and time distortion. In the remaining 200 tokens, the author touches on Erickson's \"common everyday trance\" that happens throughout the day, which is not problematic and can even be refreshing.",
  "content": "First Mlles pseudo-orientation in time as she imagines a catastrophic outcome occurring in the future and therefore experiences fear_ Next she uses posthypnotic suggestions (\"it will never work out,\" \"I can't cope with life,\" \"Nothing will help\") to articulate and differentiate the particulars of the negative outcome she is imagining. These are reinforced by negative hallucinations, which block her ability to see or acknowledge other resources, and perhaps vivified by positive hallucinations as she visualizes herself encountering an anxiety- provoking stimulus (such as a bill collector) that is not present in present time. All of this turmoil is likely to be further exacerbated by an experience of time distortion in which she has a breathless feeling that there is not enough time to find any kind of solution. Erickson (Erickson, Rossi, & Rossi, 1976; Erickson & Rossi, 1979) wrote about the \"common everyday trance\" that naturally occurs throughout the day. This is the type of light trance state that we all experience periodically. It is not particularly problematic and, indeed, it can even be refreshing.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the common everyday trance and differentiating it from more problematic trance states that exacerbate symptoms can be a crucial aspect of effectively managing anxiety and fear. With the help of posthypnotic suggestions and a recognition of negative and positive hallucinations, individuals can learn to access their inner resources and navigate their fear and anxiety to find solutions to their problems."
