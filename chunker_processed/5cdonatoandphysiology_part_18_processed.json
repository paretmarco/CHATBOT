  "title": "What led to Donato's discovery of mesmerism and how did he convince skeptics of its reality through rapid induction of sleep and other phenomena?",
  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author talks about the history of mesmerism and how it fell out of favor due to scientific condemnation. However, in the year 1873, Donato was initiated in mesmerism by the Canon Mouls de Bordeaux, and in the same year, Donato made an astonishing discovery, which helped him to convince the world of the reality of somnambulism and other more surprising phenomena. In the last 200 tokens, Donato's impetuous and quick nature allowed him to master his skills over time. The author then tells two anecdotes, first about Donato's ability to make a young lawyer fall backward with a glance, and second, to render someone's legs paralyzed to prove his power.",
  "content": "My will to end quickly, energetically expressed by my gesture and my glance, impressed the subject, who went to sleep with an astonishing rapidity. Excited by success I tried to provoke sleep more and more rapidly, in three minutes, in two minutes, finally in one single minute, and my success was complete. One evening in Liege (Belgium) in 1874, finding myself in a cafe, he overheard a young lawyer—M. Cudell—who denied my power and attempted to turn me into ridicule. Indignant and furious I placed myself before him and without braggadocio but with a profound conviction I announced to him that with a single glance I would make him fall backward. My audacity paralyzed his mind and succumbing to the power of my will he immediately rolled to the earth. Another time I attended Madame Michele (also at Liege, which is my native town), who had a stroke of paralysis. Her companion expressed doubts as to the efficacy of my curative power. Finally, somewhat irritated, I said: \"Mademoiselle Lronie, to prove to you my power I will paralyze your legs by a gesture. You can walk no more.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you want to impose your will on others and obtain quick results, surprising them with your abilities can be an effective approach. Like the author's experiences show, acting with lightning speed and without giving your subjects time to recover their composure can help you achieve your goals. Just remember to use this power responsibly and with respect for others' well-being."
