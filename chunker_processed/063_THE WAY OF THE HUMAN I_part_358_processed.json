  "title": "What is the Spiritualization Trance-ference and why does Quantum Psychology Bust Trance-ference First?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes Quantum Psychology's belief that trance-ference only perpetuates dependency and is a result of unresolved counter-trance-ference issues in the therapist. He shares his own experience of busting trance-ference with Indian teachers/gurus when he was a student in India. This is a concept discussed in Chapter 14 of The Dark Side of the Inner Child: the Next Step. The author warns against spiritualization and idealization that lead to a god or guru trance, and emphasizes the importance of de-hypnosis over hypnosis in Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "What I am saying here needs to be emphasized since for many this is more than just controversialâ€”it is BLASPHEMOUS. Many therapists believe that trance-ference is beneficial and that by being the \"good enough parent,\" they can guide the client through their developmental phases. Thus, they encourage trance- ference as part of the healing process. Quantum Psychology believes that this merely psychologizing and only justifies and serves the un- resolved counter- trance-ference issues in the world of psychology. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Encouraging, allowing or supporting trance-ference only begets more dependency and trance-ference. THE QUANTUM APPROACH TO TRANCE-FERENCE BUST THE TRANCE-FERENCE FIRST I would like to share my own experience of the most important intervention that I, as a student, ever experienced. I had lived in India about two years,,and without realizing it, I had trance-ference issues with my Indian teachers/gurus. In other words, if I had a question like, \"What should I do?\" \"Where should I live?\" \"Should I get married?\" many gurus with counter-trance-ference issues would play the super-spiritualized, all-knowing parent and give me answers.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while many therapists view trance-ference as a helpful tool in guiding clients through their developmental phases, Quantum Psychology takes a different approach. It believes that encouraging or supporting trance-ference only leads to more dependency and counter-trance-ference issues. To overcome trance-ference, the Quantum approach recommends breaking the trance first. As emphasized by the author's personal experience with trance-ference issues, it is essential to be aware of such patterns and take necessary steps to break free from them."
