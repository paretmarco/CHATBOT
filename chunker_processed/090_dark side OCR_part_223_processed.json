  "title": "\"How does the inner child affect our spirituality and adult responsibilities?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses how the inner child's desire for dependence from their parents can manifest in adulthood, leading to an externalization of responsibility for their personal growth and well-being onto a guru or God figure. The author also notes parallels between dysfunctional family dynamics and those found in spiritual groups, specifically how rejecting members are often criticized as having fallen from the path, much like children leaving home are sometimes labeled as having failed. The final problem state addressed in this section is entitlement, which relates to individuals believing they deserve certain things without earning them.",
  "content": "Notice how the inner child within the adult will be attracted to philosophies that keep the trance alive and well. We must understand that the path feels right to the inner child, because it is Tamil-iar, similar to the family/ child trance. Adult Problem State: Family and spiritual rejection. In every spiritual group, I have encountered people who feel finished or who aren't following the path (game) any longer. They are harassed by the other family/spiritual members. When a child leaves home in a dysfunctional family, the parents and other family members send the message, \"There's something wrong with that boy/girl,\" or, \"They are doing it the wrong way and will fail.\" It is an Spiritualizing + 139 interesting parallel in spiritual groups. When a member wants to leaveâ€”outgrows the group or feels finished the group says, \"He/shefell from the path, didn't really surren- der, was resisting, or had some worldly stuff to work out.\" The spiritualization of the dysfunctional family parallels the spiritual group. Adult Problem State: I am entitled.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember that the path to spiritual enlightenment and personal growth is not always straightforward. It is important to acknowledge and address the inner child's desires and fears, while also recognizing when it may be time to move on from a particular spiritual group or philosophy. Pain and discomfort may be necessary for growth, but it is crucial to not romanticize or spiritualize them. Stay mindful and balanced on your journey towards self-discovery."
