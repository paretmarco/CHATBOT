  "title": "How does an integrated approach to therapy address the inner child and its impact on behavior?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses how systems therapy believes experiences are context-dependent and changing the interactions or context can resolve problems, but this ignores the individual. The author's approach integrates both the individual and their inner world with the interpersonal context. Here, the author uses the concept of a trigger and the trance state of the inner child to explain how changing the meaning of words can offer new perspectives. The goal is to dismantle the inner child identity and awaken the observer. Through this method, clients can shift how they view the world. The author uses the example of a woman whose fear of men generalized to all men due to past abuse.",
  "content": "The task becomes one of awakening the observer so that the inner child identity can be observed and dismantled. Resources can then become available and the trance or the inner child (automatic reaction) lessens. When a client comes to me as a therapist, each word of description lets me know how she creates her internal experience. My attitude is, \"Teach me how the inner child creates your prob- lem.\" By listening to her words, and changing the meaning of the words, she can alter the groove in the record so that the song plays with a different tune. Let's say you give me limited associations with particular words. I expand on each of them. For example, in \"all men are untrustworthy,\" untrustworthy is the limited meaning fused with \"men.\" Changing this offers an opportunity to experi- ence new meanings for \"men,\" thus yielding new perspectives on how to see men. In order to do this, the inner child within the adult must be seen for what it is, an identity created by the observer during trauma and chaos. This shifts how it views the world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by becoming aware of our inner child and how it shapes our experiences, we can learn to dismantle limiting beliefs and automatic reactions. With the help of a therapist, we can teach ourselves how to create new meanings for words and shift our perspective on the world. It's never too late to change, and by doing so, we can unlock new resources and potential for growth."
