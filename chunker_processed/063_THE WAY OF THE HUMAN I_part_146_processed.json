  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, we delve into the Quantum Psychology Principle that states the more awareness of dimensions available, the greater the subjective experience of freedom. The thinking dimension, containing our thoughts, fantasies, and images, is crucial to our awareness. This is where exercises like \"From where does that thought arise?\" become vital. By focusing on each thought, we bring ourselves back to the space between thoughts, acknowledging their impact on our subjective experience, and letting them go. The multi-dimensional universe is easily lost if we dissociate or become fixated on any dimension.",
  "content": "If, without warning, the memory of your mother pops up, this image is at the thinking dimension. The emotion you feel is on the emotional dimension. When a trauma occurs, there is a fusion or collapsing of the dimensions. This is why traumatic experiences are so difficult to deal with because all the dimensions are merged together. In the following section, we will introduce several exercises to develop awareness of the thinking dimension. THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #1' Focus: When a thought arises, ask \"From where does that thought arise?\" When we ask ourselves, \"From where does that thought arise?\" we soon learn that a thought arises and subsides and that there is a space in between. Asking ourselves after each thought, \"From where does that thought arise?\" brings us back to that space so that we can observe the rising and subsiding of each thought, acknowledging what it is, how it impacts our subjective experience and letting it go. Imagine waking up in the morning lying next to the person you love. A thought comes into your mind, \"This is far out, I really like this.\"",
  "last_phrase": "By developing awareness of the thinking dimension, we create space between our thoughts, allowing us to observe them objectively and acknowledge their impact on our experiences. Whether it's a happy thought about someone we love or a negative thought about our relationship, asking \"From where does that thought arise?\" can help us let go of our attachments and cultivate a more peaceful and present state of mind. Try these exercises and see what insights you gain about your own thought patterns and emotional responses."
