Each breathing, you must compress and stretch the chest and abdomen, each time, and quickly enough, for five times in a row. Then rest for 30 seconds and restart the exercise. Eventually after a new 30-second pause, restart for the third and last time. Thus, it is easy to see, you act directly on the solar plexus making him undergo an inner and stimulant massage through the action of adjacent organs. The mental side of this theory is that during the exercise you keep the desire to meet peacefully in the spirit, and that the stimulus given to the solar plexus or nerve battery produces rejection of the thought. This rejection takes place by vibrations that influence the organism, endowed with more or less responsiveness and receptiveness, of the persons concerned. Third Method The third method is the muscular method. Is an ancient secret method, very powerful. The underlying theory is that each force expressed by both, Intelligence and Spirit, Gravity, Electricity, Muscle Action, and so on, is of the same essence.",
