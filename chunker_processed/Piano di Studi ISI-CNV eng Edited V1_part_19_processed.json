  "title": "What is the Alchemy of Light and how does it relate to quantum theory?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the \"Alchemy of Light\" and its connection to the hermetic tradition and quantum theory. The last 200 tokens focus on the practical applications of this concept, with examples of how it can lead to improved human functioning and personal magnetism. The text also offers information on how to participate in a course on these concepts, with the opportunity to earn an international certification. Additionally, the text outlines the possibility of expanding the knowledge of magnetism by opening a branch or chapter in your own country and participating in research projects.",
  "content": "This very same concept is also at the heart of Pribram and Bohm’s holonomic theory: \"Every sense works like a lens, and thus refocuses the visual waves both by perceiving specific elements which are reiterated so as to establish an underpinning basis, and by perceiving distinct quantities. If we were to take the lenses off, only a hologram would be left”. Given that every sense works by refocusing in accordance with certain mechanisms, it is very difficult to regain access to the WHOLE. We might call this whole a \"totipotent whole\", by drawing a comparison with the concept of \"totipotence\" which is used in the biology relating to stem cells that are capable of growing in every cell of the organism. White light is a \"totipotent whole\", inasmuch as it encompasses all the colours in its quantum superposition. What we name reality is purely the light that gets reflected on the different objects. Every visible object is already potentially present in the white light. Many experiences share the experience of light. When we observe light and, even more significantly, when we are able to discern or imagine white light even if our eyes are shut, we are drawing close to the “totipotent field\", which is in turn quite closely related to the concept of \"quantum field\". FEE: Real value of the course 1390,00 euro, enrolling at least one month before the course the amount will be reduced and we will make use of the price in promotion of 799,00 €.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Master in Quantum Physiology and the related courses on NLP, hypnosis, and quantum coaching offer unique and powerful tools for personal and professional development. The courses introduce innovative technologies such as magnetic massage, Luxmind, and quantum Psi, which can bring remarkable therapeutic results and improve mental abilities such as creativity and problem-solving. By understanding the quantum nature of consciousness and the mind, and by training oneself in the proper techniques, one can access deeper levels of awareness and achieve a quantum leap in one's life. Registering at least one month before the courses can lead to significant reductions in fees."
