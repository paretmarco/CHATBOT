  "title": "What is the essential being and how does it relate to the self in achieving harmony and true effectiveness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of essential being was introduced as the balance between a person's different parts and the surrounding universe. This section discusses the essential being in relation to the self, which is the individualistic ego and is often driven by impulsive and habitual behaviors. The worst part is that we often have multiple \"selves,\" causing confusion and a lack of direction. The section concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the relationship between the essential inward being and the self, which can be useful in adapting to the environment while remembering that it's a mere superstructure.",
  "content": "Self”, our individualistic “ego”, that is, the self that consists in its habits, our egotistic self which unceasingly craves for its “comfort zones”, desires to reproduce them over and over again, and refrains from reasoning in accordance with long-term goals as opposed to purely quotidian conations represented by such expressions as “I am feeling …”, and “I do not feel …”. The truth is that the worst aspect is the fact that, oftentimes, we do not have just a single such “self”, but rather a multiplicity of “selves”. One day we might want something, while the next day we want something else. If we lean on these peripheral “selves”, we will never truly know where to go. The relationship between the essential inward being and the self This self might even be useful if it helped us adapt to the environment, while at the same time remembering that it is a mere superstructure.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that our \"self\" consists of both our essential inward being and our external self that is shaped by habits, comfort zones, and quotidian desires. While our external self can be useful for adaptation, it's crucial that it remains connected to our core essence to avoid being ruled by fleeting moments and needs. By understanding this relationship, we can navigate life's changes with more clarity and purpose."
