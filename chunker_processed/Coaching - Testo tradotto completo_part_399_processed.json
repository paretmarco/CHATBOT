  "title": "How do we avoid being influenced by others during conversations and increase our own presence?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of influence in human interactions. It argues that even the most powerful individuals can be influenced by others, and those who claim otherwise are ignorant of the laws of human influence. The text demonstrates that people often believe and act on ideas that they have not fully pondered, simply because someone else has influenced them. The last 200 tokens propose one solution to counter the negative influence of others: increasing one's self-presencing. This method involves paying attention to both the person speaking and one's own body simultaneously.",
  "content": "The man who tells you he does not believe in anything, save for the matters he has personally pondered and reflected about, thereby proves, by that very statement, that his mind is actually unable either to reason or think in a correctly heedful manner. If, in fact, he truly had the capacity to reflect and reason as he should, he would have undoubtedly recognized the fact that, in the course of his life, he had done and believed in several things he had failed to thoughtfully ponder at all, due to the simple fact that he had been influenced by someone else. He has lent credence to certain things because someone had told him they were true. It is far easier to give instructions on how to influence other people than on how to teach one to take precautions against being influenced by them. Method 2: Increasing one’s own presence. An alternative method consists in increasing your self-presencing. What it practically means is that you shall look at the person’s face while you simultaneously pay a great deal of attention to your own body.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize that our thoughts and beliefs are not solely and exclusively a product of our own personal reflection and reasoning. We are all influenced by others, and it takes effort to recognize and take precautions against being unduly influenced. Utilizing methods to increase our own presence, such as paying attention to our body during conversations, can be a powerful tool in fostering positive interactions and creating psychological validation."
