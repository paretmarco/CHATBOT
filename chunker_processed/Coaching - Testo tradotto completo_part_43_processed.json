  "title": "\"How can strengthening our personality increase our vital force and improve our willpower?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores how the declaration of wanting to be good or brave is not enough for an individual to actualize their wish. They must learn how to will in a conscious and full way, and this can be achieved through a series of exercises aimed at strengthening one's person and personality. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of having a clear mind to attain what one wants and mentions that only ideals born out of inspiration and self-evolution within the universe are truly valid. The concept of personal magnetism is also discussed for those who are naturally able to will. This text provides insights on developing one's willpower and cultivating a positive neuric force to achieve positive results.",
  "content": "We will then be serene and happy, thrusting ourselves into the present, oblivious of the past, and without thinking of the difficulties ensconced in the future 6. There are of course some individuals who are spontaneously able to will; they also happen to be the magnetic persons who exercise an impact on the outside environment. This category of people, too, might derive some benefit from developing the methodology laid out herein, as that will cause them to refine their natural gifts further and to develop what is called personal magnetism. Ideal and Aim + Neuric Force = Positive result It is only through a clear mind that we manage to attain what we want. In the light of this reflection, it might happen that, once it is examined, one’s coveted purpose will fade away or appear to provide inadequate justification for the efforts it calls for in order to be brought about. When that happens, one’s purpose will have to be formulated anew. The truth, indeed, is that only those ideals born out of an inspiration, of the translation of one’s own essential being into action, and of a path of self-evolution within the Universe, are truly endowed with validity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by learning and applying the methodology presented in this book, we can refine our natural gifts, develop personal magnetism, and attain our inspiring purpose with ease. A clear mind and a true inspiration are essential, and with the ideal and aim coupled with neuric force, we can achieve positive results. Let us thrust ourselves into the present, oblivious of the past and without worrying about the future, and strive for our goals with confidence and clarity."
