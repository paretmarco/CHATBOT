The author emphasizes the importance of choosing tasks that can be completed within the available time, preparing adequately for the work, subdividing time and tasks, and avoiding interruptions. The last 200 tokens discuss the need to work with precision and produce concrete results, while also learning to work rapidly without compromising quality. The text is a must-read for anyone seeking to improve their productivity skills.",
  "content": "Get used to carry out the work you have to do with the utmost precision, with the utmost scrupulousness. A perfect work never has to be done anew VII. Always have the desire to see the fruit of your work embodied in concrete results, whether they consist in points jotted down in writing, recorded notes, contracts which have been concluded, etc, as if you were under an obligation to show at once to other people that you have truly engaged in some work. VIII. Carry out immediately those works you might be able to finish without delay. Deferring them or scheduling them for the future exposes you to the risk of wasting more time than you would have otherwise consumed in implementing them. IX. Beware of interruptions. Every time you have to resume your attention and concentration will cost you time and energy (The experts put such refocusing at 7 minutes). It is better to go through “longer sessions” of work than through several short ones. X. We need to learn not only to do things well, but also to do them rapidly (without, however, a concomitant inward haste).",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to work efficiently, strive for precision and speed, prioritize tasks that can be completed quickly, minimize interruptions, and aim for concrete results. Remember, time is valuable, and every thought and movement should be purposeful. With these strategies in mind, you can maximize productivity and minimize wasted time, ultimately achieving success in your work."
