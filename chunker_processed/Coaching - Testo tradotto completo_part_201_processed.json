  "title": "How does understanding the general direction in life relate to self-contained moments and temporal sequences?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the importance of understanding time as both a series of self-contained moments and a larger continuum. To illustrate this, they use the analogy of a social group, where each individual is complete and independent, yet part of a larger whole. The author goes on to explain how this understanding of time can lead to new opportunities for personal growth and self-expression. In the last part (200 tokens), the author explores the concept of temporal sequences, including the time of the self, the time of becoming, and the time of the instant. By considering these different aspects of time, individuals can make more intentional choices about the actions they take.",
  "content": "It is thus that we find two times existing side by side: A time of becoming, where we outwardly express ourselves in one particular direction, and an absolute time, being a time in which every day is lived for what it truly is, extracting maximum pleasure from it. In this latter time, we might happen to come across new opportunities which empower us to proceed along progressively larger dimensions. The discovery, as one moves on (chronos), of novel opportunities (vertical lines - kairos), allows us to find increasingly greater outlets of external self-expression Temporal sequences â€“ The time of the self and the time of becoming The time of the instant and the short span of time must be felt as something complete in itself. Conversely, the time of becoming is structured in a sequence of events. We are not, in other words, merely aware of the now, because, as we think of a particular moment, we join together a series of events, in particular an imaginary future as well as a past which is recollected in our memory 51. The length of such sequences is essential for the purpose of the action which is subsequently opted for.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and balancing the temporal sequences of the self and becoming, and living in the present moment while being aware of past and future events, we can discover new opportunities that empower us to grow along increasingly larger dimensions. It is important to remember that our acquired personality is made up of these temporal sequences and that we must strive to overcome any incongruous duration that may prevent us from reaching our fullest potential."
