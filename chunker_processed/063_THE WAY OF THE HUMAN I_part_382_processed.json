  "title": "\"How does a lack of boundaries affect a spiritual philosophy and developmental growth in humans?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we dive into the topic of developmental regression and how it can prevent us from achieving true human nature and freedom at all dimensions of awareness. The author shares an anecdote of a woman who claimed to be spiritual and \"one with everything,\" but struggled with feelings of abandonment when her husband left for work. This fear of separateness showed her developmental arrest at age 5 to 12 months. The hatching period is discussed as a crucial time when an infant begins to differentiate themselves from their mother, and how a symbiotic partner can smooth this process.",
  "content": "Her spiritual premises also showed, by her inability to work, an expectation that God or the universe (i.e., the object mother, now her husband) would take care of her. There developed a deep confusion within her when this did not occur. I walked over to her, holding my hand near her head and asked, \"Can you see a difference between my hand and your head?\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"Can you feel a difference between my hand and your shoulder'?\" \"No.\" In other words, she bad no boundaries. For homework I asked her to see a picture frame around her husband this week to hopefully begin the long process of creating clearer boundaries. HATCHING The hatching period is the time when the infant hatches out of symbiotic union with the mother and begins to differentiate her/ himself from mom. This is the time of beginning to walk, talk, etc. The more the symbiotic partner helps the infant to become ready to hatch from the symbiotic orbit smoothly and gradually—that is, without undue strain upon his own resources—the better equipped the child becomes to separate out and to differentiate his self-representations from the hitherto fused symbiotic self- plus-object representations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the hatching period and its importance in differentiating the self from the mother is crucial in preventing the development of internal trances such as the Prima Donna Complex. Creating clearer boundaries is essential for healthy self-representations, and it's never too late to start working on them."
