It 's the culmination of all the traditions of self-seeking. It also is a state with practical consequences and verifiable, here are a few: An example: one of our employees in some matches in the world of karate (he was runner-up world of the world) went into a strange state: the time of others seemed slowed down, while its normal proceeded. The result? he always won. Many so-called \"states of high performance\" where a person is extremely capable (expressive, creative, attentive, able to exploit its potential) sometimes contain elements of the Way of the Presence although they are still on the initial part of the journey, because such a development guides towards a true rebirth of the person. Developing the means to get out from mental automaticity, presence gives us access to our real potential and then things that previously seemed impossible become possible and near. Much of human actions are performed mechanically in fact, as a succession of cause and effect. The consciousness of man is usually narrow and dominated by unconscious elements.",
