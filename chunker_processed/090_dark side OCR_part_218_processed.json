  "title": "\"What is Trance-fer and How Does it Lead to Spiritual Fanaticism and Co-dependence?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This piece explores trance-fer and the way children absorb their parents' way of life and spiritualize it. The infantile message \"this is the best, only, highest or fastest\" way sticks with them and becomes generalized into something spiritual. However, this rigid structure can turn adult into fanatics, leading to spiritualization and rationalization. In the last 200 tokens, the text touches on transpersonal co-dependence, in which a child serves their parents to get taken care of. This concept is illustrated through the example of a woman who helps her child through medical school with the expectation that they will later take care of her.",
  "content": "If I don't need it, I won't get it. I would say to my parents, \"I want a new bike.\" My parents would say, \"You don't need a new bike; if you needed it, we would give it to you.\" this is interpreted by the infant/child as God gives me what I need, with the spiritualization that when something doesn't come that you want, \"I guess God didn't want me to have it, or \"I guess I didn't need it.\" Notice how the infant/child within the adult spiritualizes that God decided I didn't need it. It's as if God said, \"Give Stephen money, he needs it,\" or \"Don't give him money; he needs to learn a lesson.\" Transpersonal Co-dependence In this third level process, the child pleases and serves the parents in order to get taken care of. Psychologically, the child inside a woman might believe \"I'll take care of you (help you through medical school), so that you'll take care of me.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of only acquiring what one needs holds a spiritual significance of trusting a higher power's plan. However, it can also lead to transpersonal co-dependency, where individuals sacrifice their own well-being to gain care and approval from others. It is essential to recognize and establish healthy boundaries to avoid being taken advantage of by others, especially in religious or guru-based settings."
