  "title": "What are the various concepts of \"I\" and \"mine\" in psychology, and how can we perceive them as void?",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding 200 tokens of this text, the speaker continues to explore the concept of possession and ownership. They touch on ideas such as permanence, grasping, jealousy, and the concept of \"my body\". The speaker then introduces the concept of conquering, dominating, exploiting and destroying. The text ends with a call to notice the void behind our senses. The speaker does not provide a clear conclusion to their musings, leaving the reader to interpret the ideas presented.",
  "content": "\"I\" has a concept called my body. Okay, like it's mine. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the concept of \"I\" has about the concept of mine. Jealously, envy. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the concept of \"I\" has about the concept of mine. The I has this concept that one can conquer (cre- ate), one can dictate outside, inside, boundaries Chapter IV that one can dominate, one can exploit, one can destroy. Those are interesting ideas. So, now again, notice this, well, you probably can't not notice this. There is no noticing. Okay, well, let's just chill out here then. You know that that mine thing is just attached to \"I\", which is nothing anyway. Is that an assumption of mine? Uhm. That's simply a condensation. So be THAT. I can't not be THAT. So don't not be THAT. That's not possible. (Long silence) Notice the VOID behind your eyes. Notice the VOID behind your sense of smell. Notice the VOID behind your feeling.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to reach the Way of the Human beyond Quantum Psychology, it is necessary to become aware of the void behind all our sensory experiences. By understanding that the concept of \"mine\" is just an attachment to the illusory concept of \"I,\" we can let go of jealousy, envy, and destructive behaviors. Let us embrace the idea that creation, domination, and boundaries are also just concepts and explore the true nature of reality as void."
