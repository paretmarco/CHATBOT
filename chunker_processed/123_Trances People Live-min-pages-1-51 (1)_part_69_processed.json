  "title": "\"What is the Relationship Between Trance States and our Natural State of Being?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of trance state and its relationship to our thoughts, emotions, and actions. It discusses how we often lose ourselves in our tasks and decisions, becoming identified with them rather than allowing them to flow through us. From the perspective of the human potential movement, neurosis is caused by an interruption in the outward flow of emotion. The text also draws attention to the distinction between a trance state and a no-trance state and asks whether we create it or is it simply happening to us. Towards the end of the text, the author establishes a context for the approach in relation to the field of psychotherapy and the Ericksonian model of hypnotherapy in particular.",
  "content": "neurosis is caused by an interruption in the outward flow trance state), there is no interruption of any mot ionof any or expression of emotion. If you are in your natural state thought, feeling, sensation or physical movement. What causes interruptions? our judgments about what we are thinking and feeling, our internal censor who evaluates and identifies with this side of the coin instead of that esiddeistoinfletilieoncobien. t ween a trance and a no-trance state is, did you create it or did it just happen to you? In a trance state the experience happens to you, which means that you forget the larger Self behind the experience as you shrink your focus of attention to fit into that experience. You are not in touch with the fact that you are the creator of the trance you are experiencing. In a no-trance state, you arc aware of yourself as the creator of the experience, which then moves you beyond the experience. 5 It's All in the Playing: A Context of Approaches pER i LAPS tins is an appropriate time to establish a context for this approach in re lat ion to the field of psychotherapy in general and the Ericksonian model of hypnotherapy in particular.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, interruptions of our natural state of thought, feeling, sensation or physical movement can lead to neurosis, caused by our judgments and internal censor. By learning to observe and develop our awareness through meditation, we can become more conscious of our trance states and move beyond them. Erickson's naturalistic approaches to hypnotherapy and Eastern perspectives offer complementary puzzle pieces to this paradigmatic shift in psychotherapy."
