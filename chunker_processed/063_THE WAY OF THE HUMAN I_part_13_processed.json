  "title": "What is the \"I\" and how does it relate to the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, it was explained that the \"I\" and \"me\" are only appearances and facsimiles of the nervous system, made of the same substance as the void of undifferentiated consciousness but seem different due to space-time limitations. The way of the human, a book by Stephen Wolinsky, helps in realizing your humanness. The last part talks about how 'I' is not a specific something but a condensation and solidification of nothingness, and it reappears again in time, recorded by the nervous system. John Wheeler believes that \"Nothingness is the building block of the Universe.\"",
  "content": "Stephen Wolinsky The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness For this reason, \"Quantum Psychology\" as well as the \"me,\" the \"you\", \"this book,\" \"your last thought,\" is an event (i.e., a coming together or a moving apart of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. ).2 I AM NOT ME \"Nothingness is the building block of the Universe.\" John Wheeler The \"I\" is not a \"me,\" the \"I\" cannot be a specific something because this \"I\" is a condensation and solidification of the EMPTINESS or NOTHINGNESS which is continually condensing and thinning out, while never losing its nature as the EMPTINESS or UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. For this reason (as will be discussed later), the \"I\" I think I am is very temporary, arising and subsiding in and as that ONE SUBSTANCE only to re-appear again \"later\" while the nervous system records and acts \"as if' it were always there in time and had never left (see Volume III, Appendix: Vishnu's Demon).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing multi-dimensional awareness requires acknowledging and understanding our full human nature, which is a temporary condensation of the underlying unity of our Quantum Nature. The \"I\" is not a specific something, but a manifestation of the emptiness or undifferentiated consciousness. Therefore, we should strive to stabilize our awareness of the void to connect with our true quantum nature."
