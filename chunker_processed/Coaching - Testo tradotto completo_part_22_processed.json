  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the connection between time and consciousness is explored, and how being present to oneself and time can impact our ability to achieve anything we wish. The discussion refers back to earlier mention of bodily and relaxation methodologies useful in centralizing oneself which assists in this process. The concept of a second mind, located in the stomach, responsible for digestion and hereditary reactions is also introduced. The text concludes with the importance of being present in life and operating in different dimensions of time to fully utilize the gifts that life extends to us.",
  "content": "Everything is ultimately traced back to an issue of time: Learning a language, as well as succeeding in a business deal or in discovering something. The only Magical Formula: Knowing how to use Time well + Vital Energy = Doing and achieving ANYTHING we wish Time and consciousness are interconnected. Chronological time is in fact the same for all and sundry. It is the consciousness one has of such time that changes from person to person. As regards some people, a day is nothing more than a repetition of habits. For others, it is a great adventure in which every moment counts. In order to have more time, we must be present to life and to its wonder, to be conscious of what we do. We must, lastly, operate in each one of the different dimensions of time: In absolute time, the time of intuition and opportunities; and in linear time, which is the time of planning. The one who, at all times, limits himself to planning, or the one who, invariably, merely lives life as it comes, is only capable of exploiting some of the gifts which life extends to him.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, time is the ultimate factor in achieving success, learning, and discovering anything. The magical formula to achieve anything we wish is knowing how to use time well and directing our vital energy towards it. Being conscious of what we do, being present in the moment, and operating in different dimensions of time can help us to make the most of our time and live a fulfilling life. Building up our vital energy is also crucial, and it can create a strong foundation for personal magnetism, leading to success in all aspects of life."
