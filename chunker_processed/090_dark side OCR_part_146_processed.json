  "title": "\"What is Illusioning and Mind Reading in Relationships and How to Break the Cycle?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, the author explores the phenomenon of illusioning and blocking-out in relationships, where people may misinterpret and filter information based on their own biases and assumptions. The Woody Allen movie, \"Annie Hall,\" is used to illustrate this process. Additionally, the author discusses the concept of mind reading, which involves making assumptions about how others are feeling and reacting, based on one's own perceptions. The text mentions McKay (1981) as a source on this topic.",
  "content": "In the Woody Allen film, Annie Hall, two characters have a conversation on the balcony. The conversation is about philosophy. Subtitles are added to the film, telling you what is being said behind Illusioning + 89 the words. In illusioning, however, the subtitles are seen, even when they are not present. The child within mind reads them and acts as if they were there and real in present time. Mind Reading \"When you mind read you make snap judgements about others... There's no evidence but it just seems right. In most instances, mind readers make assumptions about how other people are feeling and what motivates them... As a mind reader, you also make assumptions about how people are reacting to things around them, particularly how they are reacting to you.... Mind reading depends on a process of projection. You imagine that people feel the same way you do and react to things the same way you do. Therefore you don't watch or listen closely enough to notice that they are actually different.\" (Mckay, 1981:20) For example, a sexually-abusive father might talk about the Boy Scouts with his son, but the child knows his father wants sex.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, freeing oneself from the grip of illusioning and mind reading can be a daunting task, but it is possible. Recognizing and understanding the process of projection is the first step. By watching and listening closely to others without making assumptions, one can break the child-to-child loop and truly live in present time. This process may be scary, but ultimately it leads to personal growth and authentic relationships."
