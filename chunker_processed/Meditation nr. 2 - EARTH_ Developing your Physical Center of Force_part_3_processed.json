  "title": "What is the connection between the black knight, the hara center of force, and the enteric nervous system?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of being a prisoner of one's compulsions and desires and losing touch with one's center. The black knight symbolizes this struggle and is trapped in a tomb under a hypnotic spell by a woman who represents appearances. In order to break free from this slavery, one must take control of their attention and direct it towards their inner energy centers. Perceval is the only one who is able to win the black knight, and in doing so, enters a palace where he sees shields and gold. The hidden meaning of Vitriol is also discussed, relating to freeing oneself from the world of appearances and accessing the ocean of energy within. The text also touches upon the neurophysiology of centers and the importance of the brain-gut axis in psychological operation.",
  "content": "But if we refer to the “secret” center of force we mentioned before connected to the genital energy, it is clear how this energy has been “trapped” like in a tomb. The black knight fights again and again with every person that goes through these places. Only Perceval wins him. And so doing frees him. Perceval wins because he opens up this deeper center A real Chevalier is always stable. He is connected through his horse (=his body) with the deepest energies of the earth. So he has FORCE If you want to win this slavery, you must take power on your attention. Attention is energy. You must direct it to the now, and physically it must go up to your second center of force. At that point Perceval enters inside the Tomb that in reality inside is a palace where there is a lot of gold. He sees gold and a serie of shields He take one of them and at the end of this encounter is stronger It means If you frees yourself from the world of appearances and you stay in the center you are in contact with the ocean of ENERGY Going to the black and free up the inner energy. This is also the hidden meaning of Vitriol NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF THE CENTER While neuroscientists still emphasize how little we know about the brain, neuro-gastroenterological studies suggest that the human enteric nervous system (ENS) and the brain–gut axis (BGA) may play a profound role in human physiological and psychological operation. e ENS seems to be a far more complex and a more independent nervous system than was previously thought.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, gaining control of your attention and directing it to the now, as well as accessing your enteric nervous system, can be instrumental in freeing the trapped energy within you. The neuro-gastroenterological studies on the enteric nervous system suggest that it is a far more complex and independent system than previously thought, with some even proposing it as a metacontroller of the central nervous system. With its profound role in the body's physiological and psychological operations, accessing this hidden center can be an effective way to overcome slavery and unleash your inner strength."
