  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author emphasizes the significance of knowing the appropriate procedure to bring success into motion. In the last 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the two crucial phases of activating success - Preparation and Ideation. The author highlights that the preparatory work demands attention and raw materials, whereas ideation needs relaxation. The text alludes to the importance of the rhythmic oscillation of activity and rest in life to bring success. The author emphasizes that geniuses have always taken upon themselves the burden of an enforced task.",
  "content": "An important component of this stage is your conscious focusing on whatever you do. First Phase = Attention and conscious Focalizing That is however insufficient: As in every other creation, even of a material type, one has to have both form and content. The content is provided by the preparatory work on the strength of which the largest possible quantity of raw material is readied, while the form derives from the unconscious which elaborates such material. Second Phase: Preparation demands attention, whereas, by contrast, ideation needs relaxation. No crystal is formed inside a glass of pure water; if, however, you insert in it a salt until the point of saturation is reached, shaking it, boiling it, in short, doing all that is necessary in order to saturate a liquid, you will obtain the conditions that are suitable to the process of crystallization. For that to occur, however, you must then allow your water to rest. Life is a rhythmic oscillation of activity and rest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving success requires both attention and preparation, as well as allowing the mind to rest and digest information. The combination of conscious and unconscious efforts can lead to genial thoughts and discoveries. Remember that taking breaks and relaxing your mind is not idleness, but a necessary step towards creativity and innovation."
