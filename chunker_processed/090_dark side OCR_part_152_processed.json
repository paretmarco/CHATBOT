  "title": "Why does waking up from trances created by trauma lead to painful experiences and confusion?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed how awakening the observer requires acknowledging and addressing the trances created to dull the pain of trauma. The last 200 tokens delve into the concept of \"con-fusion\" and how it can lead to confusion and chaos. The author gives examples of how a child's inability to fully experience and understand an event or emotion can lead to confusion trances that become ingrained in their psyche. The author also touches upon the concept of chaos and its intersection with psychology and Eastern philosophy, as discussed in their upcoming book \"The Tao of Chaos: Essence and the Enneagram, Quantum Consciousness, Volume II.\"",
  "content": "It is in this process that the experience of con-fusion emerges. For example, a child with parents who are mean to each other might experience con-fusion. This situation does not make sense to the child, and so the observer creates a confusion trance. A problem occurs when years later, the child within the adult automatically gets confused when there is an argument. 94 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child Confusion and Chaos Recently, the emergence of the theory of chaos in physics has turned the world of science around. My forthcoming book inter- faces principles of chaos with psychology and Eastern philosophy, and is called The Tao of Chaos: Essence and the Enneagram, Quantum Consciousness, Volume II. Trances are a way of organiz- ing chaos. For example, a child being molested goes through a period of chaos, and to organize and handle that chaos, the observer develops strategies, identities, and trances to explain or cope with chaos. Webster's definitions of chaos are, (1) utter confusion or disorder; wholly without organization or order. (2) The infinity of space or formless matter supposed to have preceded the existence of the ordered universe. (Webster' s Dictionary, pg.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our experiences and upbringing can leave a lasting impact on our adult selves, as we may have developed trances to cope with chaotic or confusing situations. By understanding how we organize chaos, we can begin to unravel and heal from past traumas, so we don't automatically get trapped in confusing patterns in the future. Learning to embrace the emptiness or chaos that comes with difficult experiences, rather than resisting it, can bring greater peace and understanding."
