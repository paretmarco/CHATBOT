  "title": "\"How can self-trancing and anesthesia alleviate physical pain and promote emotional health?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This chapter delves into the concept of anesthesia, which is essentially a trance used to temporarily relieve physical discomfort. It explores the importance of acknowledging physical pain as a message from the body and seeking professional consultation, while also presenting ways to offer oneself emotional support through self-to-self trance utilizing anesthesia. The author offers techniques such as using symbols and differentiation to alleviate the sensation of pain, as well as sharing personal experiences such as receiving dental care after acknowledging a toothache. This chapter is part of Appendix II, Advanced Self-Trancing, Creative Uses of Trance, which is an extension of Principles XI and XII, outlining the importance of an expanded focus of attention and the ability to create and dissolve meanings.",
  "content": "So I chose to receive and acknowledge the message called pain, i.e., \"I have a toothache,\" was received and acknowledged, and I agreed to go to the dentist the following day. The agreement, \"I got the message, take care of the message (the pain) and allow myself some sleep.\" This is a self-to-self trance in present time utilizing anesthesia, which maintains the emotional health of the individual. Ways of Creating Anesthesia 1. Symbols: Ask yourself for a symbol (mountain, river, tiger, etc.) that might help you with the pain. Place the symbol into the physical body. I once saw a client with a headache who created the symbol of Richard Nixon' s head as his own head during a migraine. He smiled as Nixon had the pain, not him. 2. Differentiation: In any differentiation work, it can be first noted that pain is experienced as a block or undifferentiated mass. I divide the pain by asking the client or myself to describe it. (You can ask yourself, for example, if the pain is sharp.)",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, creating anesthesia can be a powerful tool for managing pain and maintaining emotional health. Through symbols and differentiation techniques, it is possible to transform pain into something more manageable and even amusing. By acknowledging the pain, taking care of the message, and allowing oneself to rest, individuals can take control of their pain and reduce its impact on their lives. Remember to consult a medical professional for severe or persistent pain."
