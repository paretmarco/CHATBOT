  "title": "\"What are the Secrets of the Chivalry of the Grail in Perceval? How can we free our mind and control our elements through awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, it was discussed how we often have everything we need, but fail to notice it. By staying in our mental concepts, we don't see reality. The final 200 tokens discuss the last part of the Chivalry of the Grail initiation, where Perceval wins the giant of the castle of the air by developing inner power and awareness through meditation. This exercise helps us fight against the mental giant that controls us with thoughts such as \"I am unhappy.\" As a result, we gain mastery over our physical, emotional, and mental selves and can stay in the world with a higher level of awareness. The woman at the castle of the air gives Perceval a black horse to symbolize his success on the path.",

By mastering the four elements - water, earth, fire, and air - you now have control over your physical, emotional, and mental self. The key is to stop your mental \"I\" and be aware of your surroundings. Through the Meditation of the Air, you have entered the cave of the heart and merged your body with your heart. Imagine yourself being breathed instead of breathing. With a higher level of awareness, you can now stay in the world with mastery over yourself and the elements."
