  "title": "Can negative memories be erased by recalling them and writing over them? How does the technique of fascination work in therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of fascination and its therapeutic applications, particularly by Prof. Erminio Di Pisa, an Italian practitioner of Instant Fascination. Fascination acts on a subject at an ocular level, inducing a state of trance that allows the fascinator to contact the unconscious and work toward the person's wellbeing. Prof. Di Pisa's abilities as a fascinator are explored through anecdotes of his practice, demonstrating his mastery in the use of look and light reflection to produce instantaneous relief from physical and mental ailments. The text also explores a study on fear recall and removal.",
  "content": "Let us illustrate it with an example: If a man from Abruzzo in Italy, who had experienced the earthquake which shook that region, senses some minor readjustment shakes, it is highly probable, in spite of the fact that such negligible shakes pose no danger, that he is going to feel panic and hasten to take shelter in a tent, merely through his recollection of the tragic night of the past 6th of April. Muscular tensions, too, are purely reminiscences of significant events which have become “embedded” in the body, in the light of the fact that a tension of the body might correspond to some mental tension. The said study has been carried out by inducing a state of fear in some volunteers who chose to be tested. That state of fear was engineered by showing them some coloured squares and by associating with them a light electrical shock by their wrists, a shock which was merely annoying without being painful. During the subsequent day, fear was recalled to any such patient’s mind by showing him the coloured squares once more. Thereafter, within the space of a few hours from the creation of the said stimulus, the researchers showed them the squares quite a number of times, but now without accompanying them by the electrical shock. At the end of this training, fear is removed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy of the look or positive fascination, as illustrated through the study on fear and anxiety, has the power to eliminate negative emotions and promote self-reorganization, focusing on the inner self rather than external distractions. This technique draws parallels with Eastern techniques such as Trataka and emphasizes the importance of detaching oneself from external fascinations. Through daily exercises, one can improve their emotional control and magnetic look, leading to a better state of well-being. So, practice the exercises and put in the effort to train your look daily, and experience the positive changes for yourself."
