  "title": "Why is questioning your spiritual and psychological practices imperative for discovering your true self?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author, Stephen Wolinsky, discusses the process of questioning the underlying assumptions of psychological and spiritual practices in order to understand oneself better. The author emphasizes the importance of questioning everything and not believing anything blindly, and encourages readers to go beyond the concepts that define who they think they are. Wolinsky acknowledges the teachings of his teacher, Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj, and dedicates the book to him. He also acknowledges the influence of Alfred Korzybski and G. I. Gurdjieff. The author gives special thanks to Allen Horne for his editorial assistance, Marylu Erlandson and Susan Briley for word processing the manuscript, Alfred Schatz, and his partner, Leni.",
  "content": "Once discarded these concepts are seen as just that, concepts, and then WHO YOU ARE naturally emerges and is revealed. However, you must have a willingness to question everything and not believe anything. It is a process whereby you find out who you are by finding out who you are not. The Quantum work is both a map and a de-programming guide to hopefully enable people to wake-up and go-beyond all they think they are to find out WHO THEY REALLY ARE. In the later stages both the questioner and questionee dissolve. What is beyond this? Nisargadatta Maharaj answered this question. When a student asked, \"Who are you?\" he said, \"Nothing perceivable or conceivable.\" Enjoy the ride. With love Your brother, Stephen ________________ DEDICATION To the memory ofiny teacher and the Grandfather of Quantum Psychology, Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj ACKNOWLEDGMENTS To the memory of Alfred Korzybski, the Father of General Semantics To the memory of G.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, The Way of the Human is more than just a book. It is a guide to discovering your true self by questioning everything and going beyond what you think you are. With the help of Quantum Psychology, you can deprogram yourself from limiting concepts and find out WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Enjoy the journey and keep exploring the quantum event that is your life."
