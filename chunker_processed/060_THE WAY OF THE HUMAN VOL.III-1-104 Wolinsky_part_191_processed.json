  "title": "What is the process of letting go of the concept of \"me\" and exploring the ideas of \"mine\"?",
  "first_phrase": "In the conclusion, Wolinsky continues his conversation with Paula and helps her let go of the concept of \"me\" by differentiating and then switching the Not-\"me\"-\"me\". By reversing the process, Paula ultimately realizes that emptiness is \"me\" and this is not \"me\". Paula then discusses her ideas about the concept of \"mine\" and the various ideas associated with it. Through this conversation, Wolinsky guides Paula towards a better understanding of the concept of the self and the ideas we hold about ourselves and our possessions.",
  "content": "At some point \"you\" decided that this EMPTINESS was not \"me\", and this thing called \"me\" was \"me.\" Wolinsky:Now, tell me an idea that the \"I\" has about the idea about \"mine.\" Paula:There is a mine and a yours. Wolinsky:That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the \"I\" has about \"mine.\" Paula:I can possess things. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the \"I\" has about the idea of mine. The I believes it can own things. That's an interesting idea too. Tell me another idea that the \"I\" has about the idea of mine. The I thinks you can win things or loose things. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea that the \"I\" has about the idea of mine. Ownership. That's an interesting idea. Tell me another idea the \"I\" has about the concept of mine. Permanence, grasping. Tell me another idea that the concept of \"I\" has about the concept of mine.",
