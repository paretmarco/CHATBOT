  "title": "\"How can a written plan and sequential order improve productivity and efficiency?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author gives advice on how to organize daily tasks in a sequential order to avoid postponing complex actions indefinitely. The author suggests using either writing down the operation's sequential order or the time to execute it. The last part, consisting of 200 tokens, explains how one can mark down the right place for every operation and what to do when operations need to be carried out in a different order. The names and concepts mentioned in the text are not specific.",
  "content": "In the second small column, one will have to mark with a cross those operations which have already been finalized. Avoid, in that manner, the possibility of erasing from the list those operations which have been already carried out, as we are duty-bound to locate them subsequently, at the time, that is, of analytically revisiting the whole day. The change in the order of operations might even be the product of the type of activity involved. Every activity in fact inevitably demands a particular mental attitude, and it is thus preferable to carry out that activity which best suits the mental attitude we might have at any given moment. The converse is likewise true. Be it as it may, the various points must have been exhaustively gone through by the end of the day. The second part of the page is occupied by a column in which one is going to set out those occupations which have to be implemented within an undefined time span, as the need for them progressively arises. It will be up to us to assign to them a precise position within our future activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to effectively plan and carry out daily tasks, it is crucial to prioritize and organize them based on their importance and our current mental state. By keeping track of completed tasks and assigning future tasks to an indefinite timeframe, we can ensure a productive day while avoiding unnecessary stress and chaos. Remember to always ask yourself what specific goals you plan to achieve for the day, month, or year, and adjust accordingly as needed."
