  "first_phrase": "This text is about how the inner child identity affects present-time interactions. The observer freezes the memory using fear, which becomes a vehicle to inhibit the natural flow of memory. The inner child relates past-to-child rather than present-time self-to-other, causing people to often feel alone in relationships. In illustration #2, we see examples of transference and countertransference in which individuals' inner child trances affect their interactions with others. These trances become frozen or created by interpersonal experiences, further affecting present-time interactions. The article provides insight into the relationships between the present and the past, and the effect the inner child has on our current connections with others.",
  "content": "We move from self-to-other in present time, to child-to-parents in past time. The inner child becomes the hypnotist making suggestions to the present-time adult, who is the subject. In doing this, we lose our connection with the other person and the present world and hence feel lonely, misunderstood, and alienated. AB Illustration #2 Age Regression + 31 In illustration #2 we see the inner child of person B hypnotizing the internalized parent in person A. Interestingly, the inner child of person A is hypnotizing the parent of person B. This is trance- ference, and counter trance-ference, and is the cornerstone of problem states that occur in relationships. In the former example, where the woman goes into the \"I'm not smart enough\" a inner child trance, she probably will pick a man who treats her that way. This mutual inner child trance between her and her husband possibly might be a re-creation of both her inner child and his inner-child family trance. (See Illustration 2.) The inner child's trance becomes frozen or created by a series of interpersonal interactions in the family, which take over individual experiences of NOW.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember that to have a healthy relationship, it's essential to stay present and conscious of your actions. Age regression can create blind spots in our current interactions, leading us to miss present-time opportunities for happiness. By recognizing and addressing our inner child's needs, we can avoid falling into inner child trances that jeopardize our relationships."
