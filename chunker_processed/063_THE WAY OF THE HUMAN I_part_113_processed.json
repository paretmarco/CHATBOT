  "title": "How can we wake up from societal trances and become fully human?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author highlights how society and media influence our perception of personal fulfillment, leading us to become disconnected from our human nature. The last 200 tokens explore how to awaken and become fully human by exploring multi-dimensional awareness and the pitfalls that prevent us from achieving this. The author introduces the Special Section, focusing on trances and spiritual pitfalls that take us out of present time, out of our body, relationships, and out of humanity. The chapter offers insight into our deepest, most resistant problem, the machine-like automatic trances, which are difficult to confront.",
  "content": "We cannot know what we need to look for to become human until we first \"explore\" where we area Second, we need to learn to see the subtle nuances which prevent us from being human. In the next few chapters we will explore multi-dimensional awareness. In the Special Section the focus will be on trances and spiritual pitfalls. We will look at the most frequently misunderstood trances (psychological and spiritual as well as mundane) which take us out of our body, out of relationships, out of the world, out of present time and out of humanity. And, ultimately, out of ESSENCE and the Underlying Unity of Quantum Consciousness. In the words of my teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj, \"You cannot let go of something until you know what it is.\" Quantum Psychology takes this one step further: \"You cannot let go of something until you are willing to experience it.\" The Special Section may seem difficult but I ask you to stay with it and persevere. For it is here that you will find a discussion of these machine-like automatic trances which are our deepest, most resistant problem, the ones most difficult to confront.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, exploring our current state of being and learning to recognize the subtle nuances that prevent us from being fully human is the first step towards multi-dimensional awareness. Quantum Psychology teaches us that we cannot let go of something until we are willing to experience it. By confronting and dismantling our machine-like automatic trances, we can wake up to the larger context of who we are on all dimensions of reality and go beyond them. This is The Way of the Human, where we ultimately realize the Emptiness/Fullness of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE."
