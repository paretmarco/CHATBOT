  "title": "\"Can Instant Fascination Cure Pain and Anxiety? An In-Depth Look at the Techniques of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens in this text provide some fascinating anecdotes about the abilities of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa as a fascinator and healer. He had a unique ability to put people into a state of fascination and cure a variety of physical and psychological ailments almost instantly. He was fond of using his power of fascination even in his everyday life, from causing people to quit smoking to making waiters unconsciously prepare multiple cups of coffee. He was truly gifted and charismatic, with a strong personality and a passion for helping others.",
  "content": "This specific subject who was walking by Via Procaccini fell into the said category. Not surprisingly, therefore, Erminio, from inside the cafeteria, resorted to a brusque movement by raising his hands and staring at his eyes intensely while such person was crossing the road. The subject suddenly remained motionless in the middle of the street, frozen in that condition for a good thirty seconds, until Di Pisa eventually lowered his arms. He did not let anything intimidate him. One day, while in Piazza Cairoli, he pointed his index finger at an approaching passer-by chosen at random, whereupon he started issuing him such injunctions as, ‘Go there’ and ‘Turn that way’. The passer-by promptly carried out the said instructions in a hypnotic state, without realizing what was going on. When Di Pisa finally woke him up from that state, the person concerned no longer knew where he was. Di Pisa, in fact, did not limit his self to using fascination with a high level of mastery within the four walls of his study, but did so in everyday life as well. There was a time when he invited a friend of his to a cafeteria. Purely by his look, he plunged the waiter into a state of fascination which caused him to delve into an automatic state. As a result of that, the waiter mechanically began to prepare a first cup of coffee, followed by a second and a third one, placing all of them on the counter, and went on doing that non stop.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the technique of instant fascination developed by Erminio from Pisa, also known as \"instant hypnosis\", has shown remarkable success in treating physical pains, muscular tensions, headaches, and other bodily ailments. Fascination through the gaze allows patients to transcend mental habits and move beyond their personal problems. The therapy of the look, as it is called, aims to eliminate negative fascination and facilitate self-reorganization. Comparisons with Eastern techniques have shown the usefulness of detaching from external distractions to achieve a mental void. Ultimately, the therapy of the look guides patients to a new life dimension, where they experience total concentration and freedom from pain."
