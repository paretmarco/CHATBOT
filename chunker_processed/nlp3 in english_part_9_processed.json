  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the use of nonverbal communication in hypnosis and introduces the concept of multisensory induction. The first part of the text discusses different types of nonverbal communication and how they can be used to induce a trance. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the core of hypnosis and the possibility of inducing a trance without using any meaningful words at all, focusing instead on nonverbal communication. The text also touches on the history of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) and introduces NLP 3, emphasizing the importance of integrating different techniques for an easy implementation in different contexts. The text concludes with a discussion of multisensory hypnotherapy and its relationship with Ericksonian hypnotherapy.",
  "content": "Normal phases in a Non Verbal Technique Seance are: 1) REP (positive empathic rapport) 2) Introduction of analog elements (elements creating emotional tension) 3) Introduction of symbolic elements (these elements break the old schemas) 4) Analog tests (optional; consist in non verbal suggestions) 5) Passing test (optional: show us if the subject is ready for the intervention) 6) intervention (multisensory hypnotherapy) MULTISENSORY HYPNOTHERAPY It is very simple and depends on the efficacity of the preceding induction; you use words to suggests some images that bring in the direction you want. You don't need to be logic; you need just that what you do be very integrated in a whole idea suggesting the change. Very useful is speaking directly to the subconscious as it were a separate identity. Very useful is too the use of symbolic elements during the hypnotherapeutic phase. MULTISENSORY POST-INTERVENTION HYPNOTHERAPY Giving exercises to do to the client enhance the results; you can structurate the exercises in such a way to give the clients: 1. blocks (you don't have to do something during the week) 2. obligations (you must do something, such as hearing a audiotape) These two little elements will make dramatically rise your the results rate. MULTISENSORY HYPNOSIS AND ERICKSONIAN HYPNOTHERAPY Ericksonian hypnotherapy involves the use of complex phrases and expressions; through the correct use of the non verbal communication, you can get the client very involved in what you say and each word you use will have a stronger emphasis.",
