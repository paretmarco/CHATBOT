  "title": "How does health, vitality, and the spinal column contribute to effective thought and manifestation in reality?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the relationship between health, consistency of thought, and willpower was explored. Both Eastern and Western traditions emphasize the role of the spinal column and its energy centers, chakras, in this process. In the final part, the focus is on developing control over the organic and cellular parts of the being through the will, as it represents the manifestation of thought. The significance of the base of the spinal column and its symbolic connection to the Aries sign is discussed, along with the symbolism of the caduceus as a representation of solar and lunar energies. The role of will in willing action and manifestation is also highlighted.",
  "content": "This is an aspect which is not even taken into consideration by the traditional schools, and yet has an essential role to play, since we gather our will through the way we look. The purely organic and cellular part of the being does not only need to be developed. It must in fact also be subjected to the control of the will, as the latter equally represents a manifestation of thought, in its material, physical, practically applied aspect. The base of the spinal column is the departure point of such energy, and is symbolically linked to the sign of the Aries, as a way of emphatically underlining the primal force which is located in it. The very same concept is also present in the Indian notion of kundalini. A Western symbol of comparable power is the caduceus, with its two snakes wrapping themselves around a rod. Such symbol (which by the way has been adopted by a number of medical orders) directs attention towards the solar end lunar (masculine end feminine) energies which wrap themselves up around the central column. Will bears the meaning of willing action. It denotes manifestation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing and controlling our will is essential for manifesting our thoughts and enlivening matter. This involves understanding the primal force located at the base of our spinal column, which can be activated through correct breathing. By accumulating potency and placing our faculties in a state of erethism, we can harmonize our organic functions and achieve a state of wellbeing. Traditional schools may not consider these aspects, but they play a crucial role in our overall development."
