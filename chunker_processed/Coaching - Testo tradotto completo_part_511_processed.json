  "title": "How can intuition be developed and why is it important in achieving superior results?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of intuition and its connection to superior achievement, particularly in the financial world. The author emphasizes the importance of being open-minded and overcoming negative emotions to access intuition. The last 200 tokens provide evidence of intuition as a physiological phenomenon, citing research that shows an increase in gamma-type brain waves during moments of discovery. The author quotes Prof. Jeffrey Schwartz's research to support the point. By understanding intuition as a natural and measurable phenomenon, readers can better appreciate its potential and importance in decision-making.",
  "content": "Intuition as a physiological phenomenon The concept of intuition is innately connected with the human being, and it is often so profound that it might even be watched from the outside, in non-verbal communication. It has in fact been proved that, at the time of getting a “stroke of genius”, that flash of brilliance might further be accompanied by access to different rhythms on the part of the brain waves, one capable of being measured by appropriate equipment. We might make mention in this regard of the researches quoted by Prof. Jeffrey Schwartz. Prof. Schwartz has conducted a series of researches with a view to understanding what happens to the human mind when in its processes of discovery it unveils new maps. One of the conclusions reached by that research was that, at that moment when new solutions were identified (the so-called “Eureka!” moment), at the instant, that is, when the mind opens up, it was possible to witness the development of gamma-type brain waves which coincided with the fact that many neuronal areas were then working in synchrony. It is as if the neurons functioned all together, thereby multiplying the single power.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, intuition is a physiological phenomenon connected with the human being and has been linked to the development of gamma-type brain waves, which coincides with many neuronal areas working in synchrony. It is possible to develop intuition by building an informed instinct, which requires accumulating experience and processing it in a specific manner by our unconscious mind. With practice, anyone can learn to trust and rely on their intuition, leading to better decision-making and successful outcomes."
