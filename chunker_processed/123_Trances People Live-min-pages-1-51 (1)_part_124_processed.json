  "title": "\"How can witnessing and age regression therapy help heal trauma?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, the author discusses a technique for healing trauma by bringing age-regressed parts of oneself into the present moment with the help of a wise figure, as illustrated in Erickson's \"February Man\" case. By merging and integrating these parts with new resources and perspectives, the author suggests that one can overcome contextual constraints on behavior and experience greater wholeness. The previous tokens explore the act of witnessing, expanding the self through observation, and talking to age-regressed parts of oneself to offer support and resources.",
  "content": "4, 3 Sc.,' • nct vou have time-traveled: You have brought the age- 'd parts of your self into the context of the present moment, olose yourattention is no longer narrowed and fixated in the trance state A- can now expand and respond fully. Suggestion Revisioning Trauma Erickson 's ingenious case of the \"February Man\" (Erickson & Rossi, 1989) contains the prototype for this approach to healing ram As the February Man, Erickson \"visited\" his client during octal age-regressed sessions, during which her various traumas re.experienced in the context of the added wisdom, insight, 3rA support provided by this figure of the wise old man. In the ach described below, the client recreates several states of app ix mg that now co-exist in •relation to the trauma. Each state of being vises e n tin ly within the client: the child prior to the trauma (if the tranaoccurred when the chi Id was 6, then this child is 5), the child in the =ma, the adult, and the person who has successfully rtsolveti the trauma in present time (via pseudo-orientation in time).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, revisiting past traumas through multiple states of being using Erickson's approach can provide added wisdom, insight, and support for the client to resolve their trauma in the present moment. By seeing themselves in various stages of life, they can find new perspectives and approaches to moving forward. This technique also reduces the risk of projecting onto the therapist and puts the power of healing in the hands of the client. Remember to follow the steps of seeing the child prior to the trauma and then seeing the child as an older person who has successfully resolved the situation."
