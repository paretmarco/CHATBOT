  "first_phrase": "In this article, we explore how fascination can bring the subject to a passive consciousness while acting on the eye as a primary tool. The previous portion of the text explained the functioning of the mind when we engage in thinking and evaluating our perceptions, creating a make-believe world of labels and opinions. Fascination uses several factors, including accommodation, to observe how natural vistas are perceived. In particular, we will delve into how alterations in sensory perceptions, like the \"big face\" effect, occur as a result of shifts in the distance the eye is accommodated.",
  "content": "Goal of fascination is to bring the subject in a passive consciousness. For doing it we act on the eye as a primary tool. When engaged in our thinking and evaluating what is perceived, that is the functioning of mind... the arising of the the make-believe world of labels and opinions. That is an unnecessary activity added to the basic condition of just being...just observing. Fascination gets this results using many elements connected to eyes accomodation. Accomodation Accommodation to natural vistas depends in a complicated way on: the dark focus of the individual, the retinal locus the spatial frequency of visible texture, the sharpness of focus needed for the discrimination of object identity, for example, reading a sign. In fascination we observe: - Dark Focus position will be influenced by several conditions, and become nearer the more the individual is excited - Retinal Locus is better on the left on the individual, as vision is different from left to right - when sharpness of focus is increased results are faster ALTERATION IN SENSORY PERCEPTIONS - THE \"BIG FACE\" The apparent size of an object changes with shifts in the distance to which the eye is accommodated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the goal of fascination is to bring us to a state of passive consciousness by engaging our eyes as a primary tool. By observing and accommodating to natural vistas, we can alter our sensory perceptions and even enter a specific state where objects appear bigger. Understanding these phenomena and their physiological correlates can help us achieve greater discrimination and detail in our perception, and avoid visual traps that can affect our judgment."
