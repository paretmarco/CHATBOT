  "title": "\"What are Effective Tactics for Improving Self-Control & Physical Efficiency?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author discusses three tactics for improving self-control and limiting harmful behaviors. The first tactic is relaxation, the second is presentification, which involves focusing on useful actions and their satisfying outcomes persistently, and the third is the art of appreciation. The latter involves being present in the moment and fully enjoying pleasures without devaluing them. The author then explains the importance of physical efficiency in improving mental capacity, which involves strengthening both vital and nervous forces, developing eurhythmy, and adopting a physical regimen that does not sap nervous force. Relevant concepts and people discussed in this section include self-control, personal magnetism, and eurhythmy.",
  "content": "By proceeding along that path, we will eventually realize that we have the ability to derive the same magnitude of enjoyment from a lower consumption of energy. The art of appreciation, which includes how to appreciate the universe, must be enduringly present in our beings. Exercises aimed at improving physical efficiency and self- control In order to be regaled with a clear and balanced brain, it is necessary to have some propelling energy. Accordingly, the step which you are obligatorily required to take first, in order to increase your mental capacity, is the one whereby you strengthen your vital and nervous forces. Personal magnetism is the expression of an elevated level of mental vigour. No one can have personal magnetism unless he also possesses a vital force. Rather, magnetism and personal efficacy are strictly connected to a concept which we might call “eurhythmy”. What we are trying to denote with this term is a simultaneous state of balance and vitality in the body. What is first and foremost necessitated in order to develop eurhythmy is a physical regimen which is such that it does not subtract nervous force from you.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, in order to increase our mental capacity and personal magnetism, we must develop eurhythmy through a physical regimen that does not subtract nervous force. We can do this by engaging in moderate muscular exercises that speed up circulation without causing excessive fatigue or removing energy from the brain. By taking care of our physique and guarding our mental forces, we can derive the same magnitude of enjoyment from a lower consumption of energy and appreciate the universe enduringly."
