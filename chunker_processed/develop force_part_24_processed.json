  "content": "His eyes are dominating you even though he is not staring at you. He does not look in your eyes or in one of your two eyes, but looks exactly between the two eyes, at the root of your nose. His gaze seems to penetrate you intentionally â€” a sharp gaze, but does not have anything unpleasant. You feel that he is not cheeky. Note as well that he will not look at you in this way when spoken to, but waits for your communication to send his. 6. He is always courteous. He listens to you gently: is always polite, but you get the impression of an unbending will beneath the apparent calmness: you sense a power. Is the man to whom one must obey: in a word, the impression he generates in you is that of one that knows exactly what he wants and is not in a hurry because he is certain to get it. 7. His conversation is simple. Let us analyze his conversation. Has taught you anything? Very little: what he says is not generally important to you, but gives you the impression that it is, while you listen. He makes you feel that, if he would like to, he could say much more. Therefore, he stings your curiosity, but he does not give you the impression of an attempt to mystify you. His eye is too frank, and even if you knew him since ten years, you will never discover in his conversation the clue of a trap he sets to be admired. 8.",
