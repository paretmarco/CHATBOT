  "title": "\"What are the different ideas and perceptions about the concept of 'I' in human psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the conclusion of this conversation between Wolinsky and Paula in \"The Way of the Human,\" the concept of \"I\" takes center stage. Paula puts forth several ideas about the nature of \"I,\" including its association with existence, the fact that it is first person singular, and that its existence implies the existence of a \"you.\" They also discuss the idea that \"I\" has feelings, thoughts, beliefs, and memories, as well as dreams and ideas about time. Finally, Paula suggests that while the \"I\" may have ideas about itself, there are no words to describe what is truly going on.",
  "content": "Paula:it there is an \"I\", there's a \"you.\" Wolinsky:Okay, tell me another idea you have about \"I\". Paula:It means \"I\" am here. Wolinsky:That's an interesting idea. Without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions, what is here? Paula:Silence. (No response) Wolinsky:Tell me another idea you might have about \"I\". Paula:\"I\" has feelings and thoughts and beliefs and as- sociations and memories. Wolinsky:Okay, are \"you\"? Paula:Silenceâ€”no. Wolinsky:Tell me another idea you have about \"I\". Paula:\"I\" has dreams and fantasies and ideas about time. Wolinsky:That's an interesting idea. Tell me a difference between you and \"I\". Paula:I am before the \"I\". 184 Chapter IV Wolinsky:Tell me another idea that the \"I\" has about itself. Paula:The idea that the \" has about itself is that exist. Wolinsky:Okay. So what is going on? Paula:There are no words.",
  "last_phrase": "In exploring the nature of \"I\" and \"you\", Paula and Wolinsky have discovered that the concept of self is fluid and ever-changing, and that there is value in exploring our perceptions and associations with ourselves. By shifting our perspective and embracing the idea of emptiness, we may discover new insights about ourselves and the world around us."
