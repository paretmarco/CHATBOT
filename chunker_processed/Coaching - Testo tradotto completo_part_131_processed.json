  "title": "\"How can becoming present to ourselves help us achieve our true purposes and unleash our potential?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the concept of realizing one's true potential and centralizing the self is explored. The author draws a comparison to the heightened sensory experience felt during a trip to a foreign country, and how tapping into this deeper basis can simplify and enrich life. The relativity of everything is also emphasized, with a quote by an Arab sage highlighting the impermanence of worldly dominion. By understanding this, one can act more freely and endure life's ups and downs. The author encourages readers to reflect on past worries and anxieties and realize that life often unfolds independently of their outcomes.",
  "content": "Naturally, personal power, too, expands, as that course leads man to the only point where the springhead of such power is situated, namely, his own self. Being centralized, being present to ourselves, also leads one to understand the relativity of every thing and every fact. We must make the following saying by the Arab sage part of our existential lexicon: — Have you conquered the earthly dominium? Do not rejoice about that, as it is nothing. Have you lost the worldly dominium? Do not grieve, as it is nothing. Everything in the world passes away and is nothing. — This concept must be used to benefit to us, not in order to give up acting, but rather in order to act more freely, and to endure on firmer grounds fortune’s wrongs and caprices. Whoever wants to look back and remember his anxieties, or the worries he experienced as a result of some fact on which his destiny in life seemed at that time to depend, will realize that his life has almost always unfolded itself independently of the outcome of that fact. He will realize therefore that being so concerned with it was undeserving of the effort.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to understand the relativity of everything in life and to use this concept to our advantage. Instead of being overly concerned with the outcomes of certain events, we should focus on acting more freely and enduring life's ups and downs on firmer ground. To achieve this, we must review our lives and make conscious choices based on our personal goals rather than fear. We can also benefit from facing ourselves in the mirror and staying present in our body. Through these exercises, we can expand our personal power, leading to a more fulfilling life."
