  "title": "\"How can integrating Chronos and Kairòs help us reach our goals and live in the present?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the relationship between Chronos and Kairòs and how they complement one another. The author explains that ideation, representing the horizontal dimension, creates a plane of logically conceived ideas that is inspired by the will to actualize. By aligning with our life plan, we can prevent further dispersion and engage in constructive action. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the importance of pre-imagination and goal-setting in channeling our energy towards meaningful action. The text emphasizes the significance of being present in the moment and relating every life event to ourselves to discover new possibilities.",
  "content": "This pre-imagination is an intention to engage in an action, and the equivalent of a state of channelling energy, which lets our inward being know what it should be doing. In that manner, the response or the act will be carried out very rapidly, so rapidly that no time will be available for external incitements to interpose themselves in the narrow interstice between the thought and the response or the act. It is however important to plan in relation to a goal. Besides, such goal will only be a firm one if it is connected with our beings. The real man always knows what he wants (Tao Te King) It is the realization of our ideal which grants firmness and prevents subsequent dispersions. One can possibly assert that constructive, hence useful, action, is only that action which rests on one’s life plan. That, of course, does not mean that we have to identify ourselves with such goal. In every moment, we must always be present to ourselves, so that we are in a position to relate every life event to ourselves, by for instance “pouring that event into us”, and by possibly discovering new possibilities in the process.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to pre-imagine our actions before carrying them out as it allows us to channel our energy towards a firm goal that is connected to our beings. The goal should be part of our life plan and practical ideation can be used to organize our thoughts and orient our actions towards it. By doing so, we create interest and eliminate distractions, ultimately leading to more productive and fulfilling work and pleasure."
