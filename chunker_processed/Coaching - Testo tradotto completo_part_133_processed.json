  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of being present in our own lives and not burdening ourselves with exhausting tasks and futile nuisances. The section concludes with a call to begin with our sensory reality and learn how to turn self-presencing into our hallmark even when we deal with interpersonal relationships. Before that, the text focuses on two exercises - Reviewing life and The mirror, which encourage the reader to become conscious of the choices they make and to face themselves honestly. The author highlights that many things we consider indispensable may actually be superfluous and waste our time and energy, calling for a more mindful approach to life.",
  "content": "Most men live by generally doing what they do not want to do, by visiting and receiving people they do not want to see, by saying what they do not think, by spending time and money in what they would not like to spend them on 38. In so doing, they burden themselves with exhausting tasks and futile nuisances which do not avail them at all in accomplishing their own destinies. Several men wear themselves out by engaging in works which are exceedingly useless. The interest we inject into things that are of no concern whatsoever to us is but misplaced interest. Getting heated up, enervating ourselves in an attempt to defend or attack opinions which are foreign to our occupations, is to waste our time and energy, and accordingly dry up the source of calm which is an indispensable requirement of our success. Let us try and be present to our own selves. We should begin with our sensory reality, via the exercises set out here above, and move ahead further from there. We must learn how to turn this attitude of self-presencing into our hallmark even when we deal with interpersonal relationships.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we must recognize the futility of burdening ourselves with pointless tasks and engaging in useless works that do not contribute to our destinies. By learning to be present to ourselves and avoiding excessive self-esteem, we can overcome the encumbrance of our ego and focus our mental energy on what truly matters. Let us remain mindful of our sensory reality and strive for greatness without allowing our inner dialogues to consume us."
