  "title": "\"How Can You Achieve Presence in Trading and Overcome Emotions to Succeed?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned the importance of maintaining a state of indifference and avoiding emotional trading. Now, the author emphasizes the necessity of discipline and stripping every action of its emotional dregs to achieve \"presence in trading.\" This technique requires reasoning out situations coolly and reducing them to their objective essence. The author gives an example of a mountain track, where a child confidently walks while an adult trembles in fear. In any situation, one must reflect and determine whether it is arbitrary or not before making a decision.",
  "content": "Suddenly, the fear of falling seizes your being; your legs are shaking, you are breathing heavily, and your vision is getting blurred. If you, instead of losing control, were to successfully reason out things coolly, to study your position the way a surveyor who is specialized in topography would do, to ask yourselves: «Is it or not factually possible for me to walk through this track», then the difficulty, the level of predicament you are facing, would be vastly reduced. A corroborating proof of the aforesaid is that a careless child will firmly move along that track, whistling some tune as he does so, whereas you had trembled at the idea of carrying out precisely what he executed so nonchalantly. Any fact is either arbitrary or not. If it is indeed arbitrary, make your decision after a moment of pensive reflection; if it is not, give it up, exactly as you would relinquish the idea of landing on the moon, or else accept it a-critically as it is, without any further ado.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome fear and make sound decisions, approach facts with a clear and rational mind. Practice deep breathing and halt emotional justifications that only perpetuate anxiety. Remember, you create your own life and goals, but to succeed you must slay the impulsive self and exercise control over your impulses."
