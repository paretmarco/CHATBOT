  "title": "\"How does idealizing parents and spouses affect adult behavior?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author discussed the survival strategies of a child when facing a dysfunctional situation, leading to the second level of development called \"idealizing.\" In this last part, the author talks about how the inner child within adults idealize their partners, causing problems in present times relationships. The inner child within an adult may create an imagined ideal spouse or build up their partner to feel good about themselves to gain their care and love. Unfortunately, this desperate wish often stems from an unavailable source in a dysfunctional family.",
  "content": "130 â€¢ The Dark Side of the Inner Child Adult Problem State: Years later in relationships, the inner child within the adult idealizes her spouse. This prevents the present time adult from seeing her spouse in present time. Sometimes the inner child will idealize to the degree of only seeing, or falling in love with, the potential or imagined ideal of the spouse. In other words the child within the adult uses the trance with the spouse that worked with the parents. Illusioning, fantasizing or blocking out might be used. Unfortunately for the present time adult, they are unaware of these trances, while the observer remains fast asleep. In another scenario, the inner child within the adult makes his spouse into an ideal by \"building her up,\" making the spouse feel good about herself. In this case, the child within believes, \"If I build you up, you'll take care of me.\" To be taken care of is a normal wish. Unfortunately, in a dysfunctional family, this is a desperate wish because care and love are unavailable. Adult Problem State: Idealizing other people, lessening yourself in order to idealize others.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, being aware of our inner child and how it influences our adult relationships, especially the way we idealize our partner, is crucial to overcoming dysfunctional patterns. By recognizing these trance-like states, we can start to break free from limiting beliefs and take ownership of our own power, leading to healthier and more fulfilling relationships."
