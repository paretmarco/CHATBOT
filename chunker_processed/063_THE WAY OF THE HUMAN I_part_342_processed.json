  "title": "What is the Mirror Trance in Narcissism and How Does it Influence Relationships and Development?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the need for mirroring in individuals with narcissistic personalities as well as how gurus may allow their disciples to take on their personality instead of frustrating their attempts to realize the truth. In this last part, the author gives examples of individuals who organize their external world to support their false selves, such as a body therapist who took on the identity of her teacher. The author also discusses the mirror trance and the case of married couples where the wife overworks supporting her financially troubled husband. These examples further illustrate the concept of mirroring and its impact on individuals' sense of self.",
  "content": "This demonstrates both the disciples' age regression and misunderstanding of the guru's teachings about the SELF AS THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, and the guru's unwillingness to give up the narcissistic sense of being the center of attention. I once met a very well-known body therapist who took on the identity of her teacher. People always commented on how awful she was as a personâ€”bUt always claimed what a great teacher she was, and when she taught she was just like her teacher. The problem was, in doing her somatic work she was fabulous, but she had never inte- grated the work into her life. Rather, she had an identity which was taken on from her teacher, which was a compensated age regression while in her life she remained a decompensated age-regressed child. Regarding the mirror trance-Terence, I know several married couples where the wife continually tells me of her husband's ability to succeed financially, even though he owes money or has nothing. 220 Special Section In the second type, the wife not only tells herself and others of her husband's ability to succeed and make money, but continually overworks supporting him financially.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to not only learn from our teachers but also integrate their teachings into our lives. We must avoid falling into compensated age regression and the narcissistic desire for attention or mirroring. Instead, we should strive to become fully-realized individuals who are capable of maintaining idealization in close quarters by merging our inner Self with the world around us."
