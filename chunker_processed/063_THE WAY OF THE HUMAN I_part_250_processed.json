  "title": "How can dissolving past time body images help you experience your present time body in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of holding onto old body images, and the effect it can have on our present experiences. The author references Einstein's quote about changing perspectives, and explains how trauma can cause us to cling to past-time body images. They offer examples, like a car accident or sexual abuse, to illustrate how frozen memories can affect present experiences. The author then introduces the \"quantum psychology principle\" that in order to experience our present time body, past-time body images must be dissolved. They also touch on the biological tendency for humans to merge with others, and how it relates to survival.",
  "content": "Upon entering a car (specific external [context] dimension), the person then enters the past time body image of the accident which has been frozen. As another example, let's imagine a five-year old is molested. Later during sex (specific eternal [context] dimension), they enter into the same past-time body image and hence experiences the same bodily experience in present time through the vehicle of the past-time image of being five years old. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: In order to experience your present time body, past time body images must be dissolved. In this way, you can have your present time biology without being fixated on the past or your past time body image. On a biological level, just as at a psychological level, there is a tendency to fuse with another, usually a parent, as a survival mechanism. In biology, there is a survival strategy for merging, which is the survival of the species. At a biological level, human beings have a merger responsea natural biological tendency to merge.",
  "last_phrase": "To fully experience our present time body, we must dissolve past time body images. This principle applies not only to psychology but also to biology, where there is a natural tendency to merge. Maintaining distinct levels of separation is key to healthy relationships and personal growth. Don't let past experiences limit your present moment."
