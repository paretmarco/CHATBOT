  "title": "What is the Mandelbaum Effect and how does it affect our perception of distance and size?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the Mandelbaum effect and its relation to visual accommodation, which is the process of bringing objects at different distances into focus. In 1960, Mandelbaum first codified this phenomenon in relation to pilot flights. The resting point of accommodation, also known as the \"dark focus,\" is the distance where the eyes accommodate as they look in the dark. This effect causes an inadvertent accommodation response to an intervening surface, such as a hand, while attempting to focus on a distant object of interest. This can result in the operator being out of focus if they move further away. However, certain disciplines, like \"dzogchen,\" teach \"sky gazing\" to experience non-duality by accommodating to the space of nothing.",
  "content": "It was first scientifically codified by Mandelbaum in 1960 in relation to something observed during pilot flights. The use of the hand in fascination can be explained with factors related to the Mandelbaum effect, i.e. the tendency of the eye to approach \"resting\" accommodation. The resting point of accommodation is also called the \"dark focus\" as it is the distance where the eyes accommodate as they look in the dark. We note that there are disciplines, as the \"dzogchen\", that teach \"sky gazing\". Sky gazing will result in the eyes accommodating to the space of nothing and in this space we can experience non duality. Also when visibility is poor, the eye tends to relax and focus on its best distance, technically known as \"empty field\" or \"dark focus\". This distance is usually just under one meter (one yard), but varies considerably among people. The tendency is aggravated by objects close to the eye, drawing focus closer. Since resting accommodation is approximately one meter objects the operator, in the case he will move himself farther he will be also out of focus. We should note that the Mandelbaum Effect is not refractive error in the usual sense.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Mandelbaum effect and the behavior of the eye in relation to resting accommodation and dark focus is useful for pilots, drivers, and anyone interested in visual perception. Keeping windows clean and avoiding spatial disorientation can improve safety, while techniques such as sky gazing can help experience non duality. Moving towards the subject can also cause their voice to seem to come from a different location due to the effect."
