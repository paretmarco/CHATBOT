  "title": "What is the relationship between meditation and hypnotherapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the similarities between various states of consciousness and how they are often described by different names, much like water is called different names in different regions of the world. The author compares meditation and hypnotherapy, using the stages of meditation (darana, dhyanat, and samadhi) to explain how hypnotherapy techniques can induce the \"therapeutic trance\" state. What sets it apart is that in this state, the mind and its contents can be worked with, while in meditation, they are simply observed.",
