  "title": "\"Wanting More Than Money: How to Set Coherent Trading Objectives Across Multiple Levels?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of the text, the intersection between the desire for money and what we truly want was explored. The author pointed out that we tend to focus excessively on money due to societal teachings, but it might not necessarily lead to happiness. The \"ecological\" objective was presented as a way to define what we truly want and use money as a means to achieve it. The last 200 tokens emphasize the importance of being coherent in all aspects of oneself to achieve success in trading. The text discusses the physical and emotional levels and provides recommendations to avoid erroneous actions and negative emotions. It also emphasizes the importance of defining an objective that aligns with one's personal needs and desires, rather than for external validation or ulterior motives.",
  "content": "It is only if we are completely coherent, in fact, that we might be capable of exploiting the full power of our mind. Otherwise, we would be “incoherent”. The logical consequence of it would then be that our emotional brain is going to hinder the logical brain, or else that our logical capacity will hinder our intuitive ability: Physical Level: Basic foundations: Take care of your health. One of the most frequent causes of erroneous actions is a deficiency at the physical level. Creation of the Objective: Define for yourselves a specific objective which can prove to be both physically useful and pleasant in respect of your person. The mind understands sensory concepts better. Emotional level: Basic foundations: Avoid drawing all your emotions from trading, lest you become emotionally dependent on it. One of the most frequent causes of over trading is some emotional dissatisfaction which turns into hyper-activity. In addition, take care to eliminate negative emotions. Creation of the Objective: You should furthermore avoid setting yourselves a goal which is meant to show to other people that you have talent, to merely gratify an emotion, or to comply with some other ulterior reason.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving coherence in our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects is crucial in optimizing our mind's full potential. By taking care of our health, setting specific goals for personal growth, managing our emotions, being honest with ourselves, and accessing our innermost selves, we can cultivate coherence and empower our logical and intuitive abilities to improve our lives in meaningful ways. Remember that coherence is achievable through consistent effort, discipline, and self-awareness."
