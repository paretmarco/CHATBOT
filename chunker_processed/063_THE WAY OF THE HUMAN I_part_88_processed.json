  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology, and how does it dismantle the Observer-False Core-False Self complex?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text delves into the approach of Quantum Psychology to dismantle one's False Core-False Self, which represents an individual's entire psychology. The process involves enquiring into one's sense of identity, which can be anything that a person associates with themselves. The goal is to identify assumptions and concepts that individuals hold, and ultimately free themselves from the complex of the observer-False Core-False Self. Nisargadatta Maharaj emphasized not accumulating students, and the approach is not about the popularity of the author. However, individuals should acknowledge that the False Core takes time to dismantle due to its strong defense mechanisms.",
  "content": "The goal is to take them apart through an enquiry into the assumptions and concepts you have so that eventually they and the \"you\" \"you\" call \"yourself\" disappear. One purpose of Quantum Psychology is that people will learn how to take these processes or ways of working, and internalize them so that they can begin dismantling their own False Core-False Self. Ultimately, the dismantler-dismantlee and the observer also will disappear, arid there will be no need for \"me\" or for Quantum Psychology any longer. Nisargadatta Maharaj said it this way, \"I am not here to accumulate students.\" In fact, one of the many reasons this approach is called Quantum Psychology rather than \"my'.' name is so that whether you love me or hate me, you can still do the work. It is not personal to \"me,\" this approach is not about winning a popularity contest. IT TAKES TIME The False Core is so defended and the False Self so used to distract and compensate, determining one's False Core takes time.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a powerful tool for dismantling the False Core and False Self that mask our true identity. However, it takes time and effort to uncover and deconstruct these inner defenses. With perseverance and commitment, we can learn to internalize the necessary processes and ultimately achieve the freedom to be our authentic selves, unencumbered by the limitations of ego and identity."
