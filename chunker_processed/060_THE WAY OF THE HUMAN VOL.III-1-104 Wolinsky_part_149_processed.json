  "title": "What is the difference between observation and witnessing in the void of undifferentiated consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, \"The Way of the Human\" delves into the relationship between the observer and the witness. The observer is part of the observed, whereas the witness is pure awareness beyond the observer-observed dyad. The text clarifies the confusion between the two, stressing that the witness is beyond even mindfulness. The demonstration explores the NOT I-I process, exemplifying how labels fuse with identity and how the vastness of emptiness is often resisted. Through this, we learn how to identify the I and the Not I, becoming aware of our true selves beyond the labels.",
  "content": "The WITNESS it is not an \"I\" or a pattern, and neither exists nor not exists. It is aware of the BIG NOTHING \"behind it,\" and maybe even an observer-observed dyad. It is aware and rests in between the I AM and the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS \"where\" even the \"NOT-I-I\" and awareness itself disappear. DEMONSTRATION #1 This demonstration explores the NOT I-I Process. Wolinsky:What is EMPTINESS? Claudia:The emptiness is this dark, empty space and I feel alone, which I am. Therapeutic Note: Notice how the identity of \"I am alone\" is fused with the empty label and she assumes it is her, and I am. ________________ Chapter /V Take the label off, I just am. Now, if you fuse together the dark, empty label equals alone, what gets resisted? The vastness. It's like I am resisting this vast \"Not I.\" Notice the vastness and in present time, right now, decide that it is not I and this alone concept is the I. Yeah. Do that again. Okay. That's very familiar. I don't like it. Do it again. Yeah.",
  "last_phrase": "To fully experience the emptiness and true nature of consciousness, it's essential to recognize the witness as neither an \"I\" nor a pattern, existing or non-existing. By detaching ourselves from labels and identities, we can acknowledge the vastness of the void of undifferentiated consciousness and move beyond the limitations of the self to access a higher state of awareness."
