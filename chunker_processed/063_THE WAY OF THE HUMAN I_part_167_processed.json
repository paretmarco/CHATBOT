  "title": "What is the Difference Between Intuition and Training in Therapy Sessions?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author has explained various mental processes like memory, dissociation, and belief. In the last 200 tokens, the author talks about intuition, confusion, fantasy, hallucination, and observation. The author provides a clear difference between intuition and training, where intuition is the knowledge gained without any previous cognition while training is learned behavior. The author also defines confusion as a state of not knowing caused by resistance to present-time occurrences. Fantasy is defined as a dream that is created to shield oneself from present-time pain. Finally, the author talks about hallucination, which is when old images appear in awareness without one's control.",
  "content": "DISSOCIATION: Dissociation is spacing-out, going on automatic pilot or disappearing. CONFUSION: The act of creating a state of not knowing. Generally, this is caused by not knowing what to do or resisting a present-time occurrence. FANTASY: A created dream, also called hypnotic dreaming, which is often used to buffer oneself against present-time pain. For example, feeling lonely and depressed and fantasizing someone will come and take you away from all of this. HALLUCINATION: Existing in imagination or fancy, appearance of mental images. This is when old images like Mom or Dad pop into your awareness without your control. BELIEF: A solidified thought which can become a value or evaluation of self or the world. It can be attitudinal if it determines a way of life or living. OBSERVATION: The act of observing a thought, emotion, association, sensation, person, etc. It is part of the thought, association itself although it appears as separate It might appear to always be there or be prior to the thought, etc., when it actually arises with it, and some even believe the observer created it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding dissociation, confusion, fantasy, hallucination, belief, observation, and witnessing can lead to deeper self-awareness and personal growth. It is important to observe without judgment or evaluation, and ultimately let go of the observer in order to connect with our true essence. By recognizing and releasing these patterns, we can live more fully in the present moment and experience greater inner peace."
