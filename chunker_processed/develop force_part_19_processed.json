  "title": "What is Fascination",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the mysteries of fascination, an ancient technique of captivating people through the eyes. It describes how fascination is used for various purposes like healing, inducing hypnosis and developing a magnetic personality. The author also connects the concept of fascination to traditional depictions of the third eye, located at the central point between the right and left eyes, and symbolizing a higher vision and a unifying consciousness. This text delves into the fascinating world of the human eye's power and its significance in different areas of life.",
  "content": "The eye lying on the median point between sun and moon might bring to mind the importance of a higher vision and the possibility of attaining thereby a superior vision. A concept which is shared by plentiful traditions is “the reawakening by the third eye”, which signifies an opening that gradually leads to an amplification of consciousness. A link might be established between such phenomenology and factors which are both physiological and purely connected to percepton. A French researcher, Dr. Lefebure 17, used to observe the fact that this central point of the “third eye” corresponded to a certain physiological position where the normal three-dimensional vision was suspended. In theory, we could then simultaneously discern an object placed on that point from every side. Dr. Lefebure’s hypothesis was that such a suspension of the ordinary mode of perception might have a significant impact on the brain, by steering it “beyond space”. According to many traditions, such a third eye is also portrayed as being contained inside a triangle which functions as a symbol of fire as well. Fire is in fact the element endowed with the highest level of vibration 18. This link between the triangle and the eye is similarly present, in Europe, in both medieval and renaissance iconography, in terms of which the eye, often inserted within a triangle, was after all seen as an explicit image of the trinity. We find a similar symbolism in the East, where Buddha (often called \"the eye of the world\") is represented in the form of a triangle known as Tiratna or threefold gem.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the third eye and its reawakening is a shared idea among many traditions, and it signifies a higher vision and amplification of consciousness. The third eye is in a state of slumber in most cases and needs to be awakened through individual effort and development. Personal magnetism is also an essential quality to develop, and it requires vitality, balance, concentration, and self-confidence. Breathing and muscle tension exercises can aid in cultivating personal magnetism and increasing magnetic energy. With practice and dedication, one can achieve an enhanced state of consciousness and a greater personal power."
