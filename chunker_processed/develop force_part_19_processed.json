  "title": "What is Fascination",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"fascination,\" which refers to the power to captivate people through the eyes. The author discusses how fascination has been a fundamental component of human culture and has been used in various fields such as healing, persuasion, and the relationship between the sexes. The text also delves into the symbolism associated with the eye, particularly the third eye, and its connection to higher consciousness. The last part of the text discusses the link between the third eye and fire, a symbol of the Trinity and the highest level of vibration.",
  "content": "The eye lying on the median point between sun and moon might bring to mind the importance of a higher vision and the possibility of attaining thereby a superior vision. A concept which is shared by plentiful traditions is “the reawakening by the third eye”, which signifies an opening that gradually leads to an amplification of consciousness. A link might be established between such phenomenology and factors which are both physiological and purely connected to percepton. A French researcher, Dr. Lefebure 17, used to observe the fact that this central point of the “third eye” corresponded to a certain physiological position where the normal three-dimensional vision was suspended. In theory, we could then simultaneously discern an object placed on that point from every side. Dr. Lefebure’s hypothesis was that such a suspension of the ordinary mode of perception might have a significant impact on the brain, by steering it “beyond space”. According to many traditions, such a third eye is also portrayed as being contained inside a triangle which functions as a symbol of fire as well. Fire is in fact the element endowed with the highest level of vibration 18. This link between the triangle and the eye is similarly present, in Europe, in both medieval and renaissance iconography, in terms of which the eye, often inserted within a triangle, was after all seen as an explicit image of the trinity. We find a similar symbolism in the East, where Buddha (often called \"the eye of the world\") is represented in the form of a triangle known as Tiratna or threefold gem.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the third eye and its reawakening is present in various traditions and has links to both physiological and perceptual factors. It is an intuitive center in a state of slumber in most cases, and its awakening can be achieved through individual effort and working on oneself. Personal magnetism is a fundamental quality to develop, which can be cultivated through breathing exercises and muscle tension control, among others. By harmoniously reactivating intuition, an individual can achieve a correct development of consciousness and inner growth."
