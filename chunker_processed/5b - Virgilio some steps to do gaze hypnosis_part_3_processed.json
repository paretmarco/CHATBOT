The process involves the use of color, breathing, and hand movements to align and influence the subject. The author touches the subject's chin to align them on their energetic line and directs them to look at their third eye while they continuously think of the vowel \"A\". This section provides a deeper understanding of the author's methodology, including the specific eye they initially focus on.",
  "content": "I touch his kin always to align him and putting him on my energetic line; also this is a very sensible point as for exemple frogs could be put in hypnosis just touching them there When you touch his kin? I touch his kin with my right hand when I see he is expiring, so I will begin putting the hypnotic influence from this very moment What do you do also touching his kin? He will be obliged to look at me and he will find my gaze looking at him as he will look in front of him. This is the same as the legend of the Basilisk. do you say him to look at you in a specific point? Yes, at my third eye. The important in any case is the subject look at you In which eye do you look at the begin? in the right one, in order to catch before his solar mind Do you think something specific? Yes, in this first part I think the vowel A continously, in order not to have specific thoughts in my mind. The A vowel is also connected with the energy I put here.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, touching a specific point on someone's skin can have a powerful hypnotic effect, as seen in the example of putting a frog in hypnosis. By touching the individual's skin and directing their gaze towards your third eye, you can exert a hypnotic influence and bring them into a trance state. Remember to focus on the vowel A and maintain a tense body posture and eye contact to maximize the effect."
