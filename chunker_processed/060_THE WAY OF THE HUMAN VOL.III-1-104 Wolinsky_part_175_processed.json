  "title": "What is Quantumfication? An exploration of the inter-connectedness of the self and experience.",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of problems disappearing or being \"quantumfied\" once we recognize that the experiencer of the problem and the problem itself are one and have no separate self-nature. The text provides three steps to achieve this understanding, and delves into the idea of causation having no inherent existence. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into the teachings of Ramana Maharishi's \"Who Am I,\" and the idea that the knower and the known disappear, resulting in \"no-you\" and \"no-I.\" The author contemplates the notion that all information, or knowledge, is without cause and doesn't necessarily belong to us personally.",
  "content": "H. H. Dalai Lama RAMANA MAHARISHI REVISITED Looking back at Ramana Maharishi's \"Who Am I,\" we can begin to explore it at yet a deeper level. Originally, Maharishi said, \"Whenever a thought arises ask, 'Who am I?' or 'Who is this IT and the thought disappears.\" THE NEXT STEP Step I:Notice an \"I\" thought. Step II:Notice the knower or experiencer of the \"I\" thought. Step III:Notice what occurs when \"you say,\" \"What knower is knowing this?\" The knower (experiencer) and known (experience) disappear. Why? Because you go beyond the knower-known, experiencer-experience dyad, and there is NO-YOU and NO-I. 171 \"The NOT-I-I\" Contemplate: 1. That all information (knowledge) is without cause. (Singh) 2. The possibility that this information (knowledge) does not belong to me personally. (Singh) I'm using the words \"knowledge\" and \"information\" interchangeably here so that either suggests anything you know about yourself or the world. This view is suggested because in the Siva Sutras it says, \"Knowledge is bondage.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the teachings of Ramana Maharishi, as revisited by H. H. Dalai Lama, invite us to question our sense of self and ultimately transcend the limitations of our self-concept. By practicing the simple exercise of noticing the knower and the known, we can begin to let go of our limiting beliefs and find a deeper connection with our true selves. So, take a moment to close your eyes and explore the limitless potential of your being."
