  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the art of listening and leading through it. He suggests that paying attention to the interlocutor can be more beneficial than talking about oneself, and that good listeners possess more value than talkers. By watching the interlocutor, one can use the technique of \"subtext\" to send simple messages that act as attracting magnets of his/her own thoughts. However, this requires refined analytical skills to adapt to different personalities. In the last part of the text, the author provides additional details on specific cases that one may encounter.",
  "content": "Through the medium of unconscious expressions of the face, in fact, we shall gradually lead our interlocutor in the direction we would like him to take. Whenever, through the use of fascination, we enjoy a special rapport and prestige, and we indirectly suggest ideas by pursuing that method, our interlocutor will automatically adopt such ideas as his. You will observe, with a sense of marvel, that he might phrase to you the very proposal you had been personally elaborating in your mind. Additional cases This type of practice necessitates very refined analytical aptitudes, given that one has to be able in this context to adapt to the idiosyncratic psychological character of his interlocutor. One cannot possibly come across two individuals who are exactly the same. Let us therefore supply additional indications of an even more specific nature with regard to the different cases one might encounter.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of fascination through unconscious expressions of the face requires a deep understanding of the individual's psychological character. By adapting to the interlocutor's nature, one can establish a special rapport and influence them towards taking the direction desired. With practice and refinement of analytical aptitudes, one can use this technique to build personal relationships and fascinate those they desire, by projecting positive and convincing thoughts. As Guido Cavalcanti suggests, the power of love can be invoked by a single look, and one must remember that the key to successful persuasion is to first believe in oneself."
