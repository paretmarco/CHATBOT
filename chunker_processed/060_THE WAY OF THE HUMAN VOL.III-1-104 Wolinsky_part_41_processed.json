  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the conversation between Barbara and Wolinsky, they delve deeper into the concept of using another person to validate one's existence. Barbara reveals how she used to put her attention on the external world to handle what was going on inside her, thus diminishing herself. Through an exercise, Wolinsky helps Barbara make the implicit-explicit by intentionally giving her deceased mother energy so that she can exist. However, Barbara struggles with judgmental thoughts that this behavior is selfish and bad.",
  "content": "Regulating my internal with the myth that I could handle what I was doing inside, I could manipulate the external world. I could keep that person there. Wolinsky:Now, have an image of your mother over there (other side of the room). Now, I would like you to psychically give her energy so that she can give you energy so that you can exist. Therapeutic Note Here we are making the implicit-explicit. Asking her to do knowingly, consciously intentionally what she is doing unknowingly, unconsciously or unintentionally. Barbara:She's dead so I can give her energy so I can exist. Yeah. Wolinsky:Intentionally, slowly do that again. Give her en- ergy so she can give you energy so that you can exist. Do that a few times. Chapter Therapeutic Note Rather than having her talk about it, I want her to do it directly. Barbara:\"I put energy on you so that you will put energy back or give attention back to me so I will know that I exist.\" Wolinsky:How are you doing now? Barbara:I'm watching this judgment. That's selfish, that is bad. Wolinsky:That's bad.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by making the implicit explicit, the therapy session helped Barbara to recognize the root of her self-judgment and to regulate her internal emotions. By intentionally giving and receiving energy from her deceased mother, Barbara could acknowledge her existence and overcome the negative influence of her father's judgment. This technique can be a useful tool for individuals to better understand and become more aware of their internal struggles."
