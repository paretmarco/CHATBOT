  "title": "What is the role of hypnosis in financial markets and how can it be utilized by traders and investors?",
  "first_phrase": "The financial markets are ruled by hypnosis, and a trader who seeks to succeed must understand and free themselves from its influence. In the previous text, the author examined how emotional reactions from a multitude of individuals impact the market and refuted the rational market theory. This last part focuses on hypnosis and its role in inducing actions in seemingly fully awake individuals. The author mentions the potential for suggestion through authority and language and how public personalities use their prestige, linguistic and gestural models to induce hypnotic states in others.",
  "content": "Single individuals, too, might have a strong potential deriving from their position of authority which, as will be explained here under, is one of the source elements through which a suggestion can be deeply infixed in the human brain. Authority, however, is not the only way in which one can operate. Simple words, too, might prove enough. There are many different routes that can be traversed so as to induce hypnosis. There are, moreover, certain particular states, called states of \"wakeful” or “vigilant” hypnosis, in which the hypnotized subject engages in actions although he is seemingly fully awake. Several public personalities use their language in such a manner as to induce hypnotic states in their interlocutors. In doing that they pile up their prestige, which on its own is already a hypnotic factor, over some specific linguistic and gesture-based models. We are capable of realizing that by watching how they move their hands and by observing their method of conversing. In some instances, these are abilities which have been acquired spontaneously, whereas, at other times, they represent capacities which have been deliberately mastered.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, whether you are a single individual seeking to improve your communication skills or a trader looking to navigate the unpredictable markets, understanding the power of language and psychology can greatly enhance your success. By mastering the art of hypnosis and attaining self-discipline, one can achieve their desired outcomes and turn the tables in their favor."
