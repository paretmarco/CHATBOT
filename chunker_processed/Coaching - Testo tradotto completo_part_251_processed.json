  "title": "\"What is the ideal frame for our relationships and how does it affect our individuality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the arenas of feelings and interpersonal relationships. The first part of the text describes how our sentimental activity brings us to the depths of individuality and the importance of finding an \"ideal frame\" for our relationships. The last 200 tokens discuss how our social selves change based on our social class and how we should establish specific ways of living when dealing with people of different categories. The author advises us to carefully select the people whose company we keep regularly as joy and sadness are contagious feelings. Additionally, many people have accomplished success by ordering their lives to their advantage.",
  "content": "Relationships with other people Even the social self will change according to whether we respectively belong to the class of people who head matters, those who arrange them orderly, or the ones who are subordinate to their superiors. We will thus end up, socially speaking, with people who are our superiors, equals or subordinates. When dealing with each one of these categories, it will be imperative to establish a specific way of living. Let us conceive in our mind the best possible situation in our interaction with each one of those three categories. When it comes to social encounters in general, every person might be a source of enrichment. Nevertheless, given that both joy and sadness are contagious feelings, we must carefully select the people whose company we keep most regularly. Spending time with a depressed, discouraged and pessimistic individual means you are going to embitter your soul for a whole day. Many people blessed with only a modest talent have accomplished real success by ordering their lives, consciously or otherwise, in such a manner that all the elements were able to converge to their advantage.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fostering positive relationships with others, whether they be our superiors, equals, or subordinates, can greatly impact our overall success and happiness. Choosing to surround ourselves with optimistic and supportive individuals can help us achieve our goals and live a fulfilling life. Additionally, when creating a life plan, it's important to consider the impact of our social interactions and consciously seek out those who will aid in our success. Remember to approach relationships with warmth and trust in human nature, and success is sure to follow."
