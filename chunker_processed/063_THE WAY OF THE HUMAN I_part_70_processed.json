  "title": "What is the Quantum Psychology Principle and how does it relate to the False Core and False Self?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the concept of the False Core and False Self is further explored in the context of quantum psychology. The approach to dismantling the False Core involves observing and studying it without the intention of getting rid of it. This paradoxical approach leads to the realization that we are neither the enquirer-questioner nor the answerer. Through this process, we can go beyond the fixated False Core structure and liberate our awareness to discover our true selves. The text also explains how attempts to heal or compensate for the False Core only reinforce it rather than lead to true liberation.",
  "content": "And soon you begin to see that it is only a concept, and it is not true. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The paradox of this approach is that we must work with it, without the intention of getting rid of it. You work with it to see what occurs. The question often is, \"Doesn't there have to be an intention in order to do it in the first place?\" No. If the processes are done from a No-State State of I AM, there is no intention. Then, study it and dismantle it until it can begin to fall away. You might see it, observe it, the connections tracing back every thought, feeling and fantasy to see how your whole life has been organized around this one thing, and then dismantling it through enquiry. Ultimately, the enquiry continues until \"you\" realize that you are neither the enquirer-questioner nor the answerer. But this understanding occurs much \"later\" when you begin to see how everything is organized around one structure. It is then that you can go beyond the obsessive-compulsive fixated structure which is the False Core, thus liberating your awareness and discovering WHO YOU ARE.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to liberate your awareness and discover who you truly are, it's essential to recognize and work with the False Core-False Self structure without the intention of getting rid of it. By studying and dismantling it through inquiry, you can go beyond obsessive-compulsive fixations and ultimately realize that you are neither the enquirer-questioner nor the answerer, leading to a transcendental understanding of human development and multidimensional awareness."
