  "title": "What is NLP 3 and how does it use logical levels to aid in personal development, sales, and therapy, and how is it complementary to traditional NLP techniques? How can non-verbal communication, multisensory hypnosis, and the use of olfactory and gustatory cues be used in hypnotherapy and selling, and who could benefit most from these techniques?",
  "first_phrase": "ISI-CNV, the International University, focuses its research on Higher Practical Mental Sciences, Neurosciences, Tibetan Mysticism, Scientific Hypnosis, Western and Oriental Esoteric Paths of Power, and Therapy. In this article, we will explore the concept of NLP 3. NLP 3, or Neurolinguistic Programming 3, is the development and widening of the models that originally constituted NLP 1. It allows for a different logical level that aids in joining letters to correct word-groupings using techniques like anchoring or strategies in the dynamic communication-context of everyday life. Using NLP 3 means using the right tools for sales, relationships, therapy, and for personal development.",
  "content": " ISI-CNV THE INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BASED ON AN INTERNATIONAL EURO-ASIAN ACADEMIC NETWORK RESEARCH IN Higher Practical Mental Sciences Neurosciences - Tibetan Mysticism - Scientific Hypnosis Western and Oriental Esoteric Paths of Power and Therapy NLP& NLP 3 — The new logical level of NLP — What’s NLP 3? NLP 3 means Neurolinguistic Programming 3. NLP 3 focuses our attention to a different logical level; it represents a development and a widening of the models that originally constituted NLP 1. Whats a logical level? A logical level is a level of analysis of reality. For example, the term “Forest” is at a different logical level from the term “Trees”; I could walk in a forest, and tell “I see only trees, I don’t see the forest.” Why? Because, in order to see the forest I must be at a different logical level. In the same manner, to a lower logical level a computer is nothing more than a mixture of plastics and metal elements, while at a higher level it becomes all that we think when we say “computer.” NLP 1 allowed to decipher the alphabet of communication; NLP 3 aids us in joining its letters in correct word-groupings —ie: techniques like anchoring or strategies are inserted in the dynamic communication-context of everyday life. Using NLP 3 means using the rights tools for Sales, Relationships, Therapy and for personal development. Some history The original title of the book “Neurolinguistic Programming” was “Neurolinguistic Programming I” the “1” meant that subsequent developments of the NLP were to come.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP 3 is an innovative methodology that emerged from the detection of new logical levels of analysis of reality. It involves learning to be a Neurolinguistic Programmer and integrates cutting-edge elements such as pre-verbal symbolism, olfactory and gustatory cues, non-verbal hypnosis, and multisensory intervention therapies. The use of non-verbal communication in multisensory induction enables a profound level of emotional involvement, bringing clients to change their old schemas of reality faster and easier than traditional methods. These techniques are helpful for hypnotherapists, researchers, practitioners of NLP, and anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of neurolinguistics and hypnosis."
