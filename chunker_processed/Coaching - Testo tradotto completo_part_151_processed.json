  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores the physical and psychological effects of acting on impulse during emotional outbursts. However, instead of resorting to destructive behavior, the text suggests various methods of offloading emotions, including a useful exercise. In the final 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of channeling emotions into productive activities and denying the existence of anger and fear for achieving spiritual calm. The text provides an insightful and practical approach to managing emotions for a more fulfilling and productive life.",
  "content": "At that point, verbalize the new, emotion-free state, look at a light for thirty seconds, and repeat the name assigned to the regained emotion of calm. Thereafter, close your eyes for about a minute and a half. The preceding exercise will further help you redirect the energy to new and more useful areas 45. You must constantly keep on thinking that emotion is but concentrated energy having the sole need of being re-orientated. The best option consists in fact in channelling energy to the task of briskly tackling the pending matters which demand rapid decisions and which, in normal conditions, one does not dare to complete. This is the cure founded on emotional release. It is however necessary to continuously persuade oneself that anger and fear are the two most powerful generative sources of the dispersion of forces. We are thus enjoined to uproot anger and fear from our innermost core, as we would then suddenly attain a vast spiritual calm. It is not enough that we should distance such twin emotions from us. We must move further from there to the actual denial of their existence in the soul of an educated, sensible and virile person.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, emotional release can be achieved through the redirection of energy towards productive tasks and the denial of anger and fear. By gaining an imperturbable equanimity and a healthy self-attention, one can overcome foolish manias and free oneself from prejudices and false sentimentalities. Through consistent practice, this spiritual calm can be attained, leading to a more fulfilling life. Remember to verbalize the new emotion-free state, look at a light for thirty seconds, repeat the name of the regained emotion, and close your eyes for about a minute and a half to further redirect your energy towards the task at hand."
