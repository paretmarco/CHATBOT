  "first_phrase": "This text explores the impact of pranayama and yoga on various physiological functions. It lists authors and titles from different scientific articles discussing the use of these breathing techniques in the treatment of asthma, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and smoking addiction as well as their effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and higher functions of the brain. The last 200 tokens discuss a study on how Bhramari Pranayama, a yoga breathing technique, affects EEG gamma waves.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the combination of pranayama and meditation can have significant benefits for patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome during rehabilitation. Additionally, the practice of yogic breathing exercises has shown potential in reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms in smokers, improving cardiovascular and pulmonary function, inducing gamma waves during Bhramari Pranayama, and enhancing mindfulness and respiratory variability in a non-anxious population. These findings suggest that the integration of these techniques could be a valuable addition to conventional therapies for various health conditions."
