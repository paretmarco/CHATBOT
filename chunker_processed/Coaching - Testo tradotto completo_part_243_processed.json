  "title": "What is the key to success in one's profession and how can it be achieved?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the importance of health and the general sphere. However, in this final section, the author moves towards a specific issue faced by most people, that is, the problem of earning money. The author argues that every individual must examine their professional occupation before casting an eye on any other. While discussing the idealization of professional activity, the author emphasizes the need to introduce a higher element into one's profession, making it a flight of stairs rather than a road. The author believes that building is the solution to this problem.",
  "content": "Gradually improving one’s own economic conditions, along with an ultimate yearning to be set free from the need to carry out any work which is not a disinterested one; 2. Introducing a higher element into one’s profession. Professional work, in fact, ought not to be conceived as a sequence of acts which are repeated ad infinitum and are perennially the same, but rather as a course of studies which becomes ever more complex and elevated, one, that is, which is able to integrate the relevant person’s originality further and further. Without this superior element, without this desire, a profession metamorphoses into a jail leading one to eventually curse work. Let your profession be a flight of stairs rather than a road. In order to find a subject worth one’s professional study, it suffices if one pays heedful regard to the truth that few people know their job deeply, and he has the concomitant ambition to be among the best. You must also direct the spirit towards creating, perfecting, incessantly searching for pathways enabling your area of specialization to enlarge its activity profitably. We believe that the whole problem is found inside a single word: Building.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to finding fulfillment in our professions lies in constantly striving to improve ourselves and our work, integrating our own originality, and exploring new pathways to expand our areas of specialization. Building, creating, and delegating effectively are crucial skills to master in order to reach our highest potential and make a meaningful impact in the world. Let us aim to live a life where we expend all that we have to give, and achieve our ultimate yearning of doing work that we are truly passionate about."
