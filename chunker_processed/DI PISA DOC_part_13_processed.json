  "title": "What is Instant Fascination and How Does it Work in Healing?",
  "first_phrase": "This part of the text focuses on the fascinating work of Professor Erminio Di Pisa, who developed a method called \"Instant Fascination\" or \"Instant Hypnosis\" which can quickly eradicate physical pains, headaches, and other ailments. He used his mastery of fascination for curative purposes by creating a state of \"non-thinking\" in his patients and resetting their minds. He was able to identify susceptible subjects and used reflected light to aid his technique. Di Pisa was known for his exceptional rate of success in treating various pathologies, addictions, and disorders.",
  "content": "We might for example be captivated by objects or by persons, or even by our thoughts in which we drown. The majority of people is indeed totally gripped, “fascinated” by their own mental mechanisms. This is the reason why the same mechanisms are invariably reiterated, and why a problem is preserved and perpetuated. By means of the look, we thus intervene in the very mechanisms which produce the “fascination” by means of ideas or concepts that beset the subject via these mechanisms themselves. There is yet another way of proceeding: This second method consists in contacting the symptoms directly. The process is termed by some people “curing through the symptom”. Through the patient’s total concentration on his symptom, in fact, we can carve out a path allowing us to speak to that part of the brain which generates such a symptom. We thereby give effect to a mechanism which some healers have already resorted to, namely, \"utilizing the crisis as a cure\" 1. What at that point facilitates the efficacy and, in particular, the rapidity of the process, is the re-enactment of the problem itself. As stated by Rossi (1986), “by asking the patient to experience the symptom (alternatively, even by increasing it, as was for instance Erickson’s wont), we are probably switching on certain processes in the right hemisphere which are gifted with a more immediate access to the encoding of the problem that is related to the state itself” 2.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy of the look, also known as the positive fascination, holds incredible potential for helping individuals overcome negative fascinations and fears. By reenacting symptoms and memories, and utilizing techniques of Trataka, individuals can create a state of void that allows for self-reorganization and a realignment of focus from the outside to the inside. Through exercises such as staring without blinking, controlling impulses, and practicing emotional control, individuals can develop a magnetic look and positive speaking that helps them in numerous aspects of their lives. With continued practice and commitment, one can achieve a greater sense of calm and balance."
