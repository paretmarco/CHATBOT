  "title": "What are the illusions and judgments of the observer in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the nature of the observer in Quantum Psychology and how it relates to the concept of the False Core-False Self. The author explains that there are three illusions that the observer has about itself and must go beyond. Furthermore, the text identifies two types of observers: dissociated and judgmental. In the final 200 tokens, the author elaborates on the concept of the judgmental observer and how it is often in a state of fusion with parental figures. This state of fusion can later lead to the spiritualization of these figures as gods.",
  "content": "You can never go beyond the False Core Driver as long as there is an observer observing it because the observer is part of the system, it observes. Therefore the observer too must be dismantled (see Volume III). THE JUDGMENTAL OBSERVER People often think they are simply observing something, but there is judgment, evaluation or significance placed upon the experience that is being observed. Furthelinore, the observer is often either (1) in a state of dissociation caused by resisting an experience; or (2) in a state of fusion whereby the child fuses with Mom or Dad who is outside of them and observes and judges their behavior as either good or bad. In other words, children dissociate from their body-mind and see themselves through the eyes of a judgmental (this is good, this is bad) Morn or Dad, who later can be \"Spiritualized\" as gods.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly overcome the False Core Driver, one must not only dismantle the observer but also recognize the influence of the judgmental Morn or Dad that resides within. By understanding the internalized observer, we can begin to treat ourselves with the same compassion and understanding that we wished we had received from our parents. This integration leads to a deeper level of self-awareness and the ability to transform our behaviors and emotions without judgment."
