  "title": "\"How can the concept of 'acting naturally' be achieved through mental discipline and utilization of the unconscious mind?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous 200 tokens, the text discusses the exercises outlined in the first part of the book that aim to achieve a state of \"acting naturally\" by being present to one's own self. The quality of acting naturally is founded on the concept of being one's own master, and it involves distinguishing between actions that require logical and rational thinking and those that are a response to the automatic character of life. In the last 200 tokens, the ultimate goal of mental discipline proposed in the book is described as reducing the need for the brain's higher centres across daily actions, hearing the voice of one's unconscious and naturalness, and discovering the voice of one's own \"essential being.\"",
  "content": "In the latter case, one must be cognizant of how to utilize his own unconscious, his natural automatic side, as well as the “spontaneous acting” by the body, in its capacity as a spontaneous partner in the activity, from the premise of utilizing the available time down to the implementation of every single action, with the result that the part thereof which is resolved upon by the higher centres of the brain is circumscribed to the mere initial push. It is indeed enough, for the man who pursues such a discipline, to say “I do”, for everything to then unfold itself \"naturally”. Succeeding in not doing something because of an extreme resolution from the mind, and yet managing to do it, is thus the ultimate goal which is attainable through the mental discipline our method proposes. The effort, the ambition of any disciple, ought to be directed at reducing the need to make use of the brain’s higher centres across the largest possible number of daily actions, and discovering an alternative path for hearing the voice of one’s unconscious and one’s naturalness, and above all, the voice of one's own “essential being”.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, learning how to utilize our unconscious and natural automatic side, trusting in the body as a spontaneous partner, and reducing the need to rely on higher brain centers can lead to a state where we can effortlessly perform our daily actions. By following the ladder of mental discipline and allowing our bodily machine to perform non-intrinsic value actions, we can achieve this ultimate goal. So let us embrace this method and embark on this journey towards unlocking our true potential."
