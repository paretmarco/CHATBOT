  "title": "What is Mesmerismus and How Does It Unleash the True Power of Your Mind and Yourself?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus is on the formation and paths offered by the Mesmerismus® school. It offers various paths like magnetic path, certified hypnoterapist, magnetism and mesmerism trainers, and more. The text also talks about the background and theory behind the school's system, which is based on the development of a person's potential through accessing their subjective reality and complete structure. The system, which uses modern information modalities, like audio and video taped lectures and computer tutorials, also includes traditional techniques and rituals. The updated quantum magnetism/fascination and non-verbal communication techniques offered by the school are particularly useful. Ultimately, the goal is to open up access to the deepest part of oneself and achieve a high state of consciousness.",
  "content": "This has consequence: In an organization it becomes clear how every performance is linked to the \"human factor\" and the \"sense\" that people feels in the organization. Our system is also the key to the realization of a true \"Quantum Coaching\" At therapeutic levels, we realize that beyond the various techniques there is a person with which we operate and resonate and the relationship should take this into account, as well as the fact that we are a person and therefore we influence the results On a personal level, we open up to the two ways of human development: The Two Fundamental ways for the Development of the Person There are two avenues of growth for the human being: path A and path B - The direct path (path A) is the “heroic” path. For those who want to go directly to the deepest of themselves, to get the most high state of consciousness that a human being can live. - The indirect path (path B) also called “magical” path, is for people who do not have the concentration and the energy to do so because they are too distracted by daily life and therefore they want to achieve some goals (eg, success, health, money, relationships) before to have enough energy to follow the path A. We accept the fact that each has his own way of seeing the world. It is a technique of freedom.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the International Network for Knowledge Euro-Asian Academic Network Research offers a unique opportunity for students and researchers to attain high levels of personal development and expand their knowledge in areas such as neuroscience, Tibetan mysticism, scientific hypnosis, and Western and Oriental esoteric paths of power and therapy. By following the path B of human development and utilizing quantum technologies, one can enhance their inner fire and realize their fullest potential. The development of presence and alchemy of the light ultimately leads to a higher self-awareness and access to our true potential. Join our magnetic chain and open a chapter in your country to expand your knowledge and enhance your abilities."
