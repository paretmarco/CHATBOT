  "title": "How does body memory affect trauma survivors and why is body-work recommended for healing?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous passage, the author discusses the importance of body-work in liberating awareness fixated in the body for trauma to be free of body memories. The text also highlights how specific postures can reinforce memories and how physical injuries can become tied up in one's psyche. In the final 200 tokens, the author delves into the Collective Unconscious, which is a condensation of the void and contains the physics dimensions of energy, space, mass, and time, all of which influence our psycho-spirituality. Additionally, the \"NOT-I-I\" is where the \"WITNESS\" observes without an effect.",
  "content": "Part of the reason traumas are so intense is that there's a collapsing of the dimensions. In other words, your external thinking, feeling and biology all get collapsed and stuck together. This is why a trauma, now labeled as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, is so powerful and hard to take apart (see The Tao of Chaos). 51 Chapter II THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS, THE ARCHETYPAL DIMENSION (VOLUME III) The Collective Unconscious is a condensation of THAT VOID. It contains the physics dimensions' of energy, space, mass, time, gravity, strong and weak nuclear forces, light and electro-magnetics. It is the \"ground\" of archetypes, and the birthplace of our \"ruling\" forces which lie far outside of awareness. For this reason, the physics dimensions must be processed too as we see how psycho-spirituality is a br-product of the interaction of the physics dimensions. Finally, the key archetype, the I AM is in this dimension. As Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"The I AM comes from the collective.\" THE NOT-I-I The \"NOT-I-I\" is where the WITNESS WITNESSes the observer-observed dyad with no effect.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to effectively address and heal from trauma, it is important to understand the collapsing of dimensions that occurs, including the external thinking, feeling, and biology. The Collective Unconscious, which contains the essential aspects of physics and archetypes, must also be processed. Ultimately, recognizing the Void and its relationship to consciousness can aid in healing and enlightenment."
