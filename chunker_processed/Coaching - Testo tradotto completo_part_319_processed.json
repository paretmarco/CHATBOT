  "title": "\"What does it mean to 'act naturally' and how can mental discipline help achieve it?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author discussed the concept of \"acting naturally\" and how it can be achieved. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into the idea of being present and how it is crucial to act with our essential inward being rather than our egotistic self. The author quotes \"The Tao Te King\" and emphasizes the need to act without effort but with the help of exercises set out in the book. The quality of acting naturally is based on the capacity to distinguish between actions that demand logical and rational effort and those that respond to the automatic character of life.",
  "content": "This does not mean that, in order for one to attain such a state of “acting naturally”, it might not at times be necessary to carry out a “super effort” capable of sweeping away the “self” and its limitations. The exercises set out in the first part of this book aim precisely at accomplishing that goal. The quality of “acting naturally” is founded on the concept of “being present to one's own self”. One has to act with his essential inward being rather than with his egotistic self. Being present denotes being one's own master, having the capacity to distinguish between those actions demanding a logical and rational effort from the type of action which, by contrast, is a response to the automatic character of life.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, the goal of \"acting naturally\" can be achieved through mental discipline and reducing the reliance on the brain's higher centers. It requires the capacity to distinguish between logical and automatic actions and utilizing one's natural automatic side. By being present, one can act with their essential being and achieve extreme resolution without an extreme effort. The exercises in the book aim to help readers attain this state and hear the voice of their own unconscious and naturalness."
