  "title": "What is the art of fascination through the eyes and how can it be harnessed for personal growth,",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the ancient art of \"fascination,\" the capacity to captivate people through the eyes. The author introduces Virgilio T., the last known custodian of this secret technique, and explains how visual rays emitted by open eyes, coupled with strong imaginative power, can produce a wound in the object of one's gaze, influencing emotions like love, hate, envy, and melancholia. The text delves into the history and benefits of fascination, including its therapeutic abilities, and emphasizes the importance of self-control and self-development. The last section discusses how fascination can improve one's presence, charm, charisma, and leadership skills, concluding with a comparison between modern hypnosis techniques and the ancient tradition.",
  "content": "There have always been tales of snakes gifted with special faculties to cast their charm upon their victim and thereby disable it from shunning its spires; their power reaches such an extreme degree that they cause birds to step down, draw closer, and let themselves be grabbed without being able to offer any resistance in an attempt at self-protection. A similar narration had also been reported to us by our master. The protagonists of that story consisted in a fox and some hens 8. A friend of his owned a hen house, and was astounded by the fact that some of the hens would go missing. Imagine how much did his astonishment escalate when he realized that such hens used to climb over a branch, while underneath, on the ground, a fox used to look at them and wave its head in the process. It appears as if, on their own initiative, the hens would then throw themselves underneath, where they would be devoured by the fox. Fascination is also the historical basis of the classical “give me your eyes, please” of the hypnotizers of yesteryear. Though such a personage is still alive in popular perceptions, he has effectively become extinct by now, given that the techniques of hypnosis which are currently utilized on a preponderant basis are both lengthy and based on the use of words. They mostly derive from a practice strand of American origin which is disconnected from the ancient tradition 9. No one among present-day professional hypnotists, not even among the most celebrious ones, is really capable of making use of the look.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the look and fascination is undeniable and extends from ancient times to modern practices. It can be utilized in everyday life, therapeutic fields, and personal growth, as it allows for a suspension of critical faculties and a natural way to enter into the reality of others. The eye has always been a symbol of knowledge and has been linked to light, space perception, and the development of intuitive faculties. Developing personal magnetism and harnessing the power of the look can make a significant impact on a person's personality and influence."
