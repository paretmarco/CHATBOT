  "title": "How can the belief of being responsible for others' thoughts and feelings negatively affect adults and where does it originate from?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of taking responsibility for others' emotions and experience, and how it relates to dysfunctional family dynamics in childhood. The author discusses the reinforcement process of early childhood development and how it can lead to a belief in grandiosity and magical thinking. The adult problem states of over-responsibility and loss of boundary are examined, along with the pre-verbal assumption that two people are merged. The text concludes by introducing \"spiritualizing\" as a new way of viewing defense mechanisms that arise from the fear of separation.",
  "content": "Adult Problem State: \"I create how others feel about me,\" or the variation, \"I am responsible for what others think or feel about me.\" This begins early and the grandiosity and magical thinking are re-enforced by Mom/Dad making statements like, \"You make me angry.\" The child believes the behavioral and verbal feedback and continues the illusion that he creates how people feel or interact. 128 o The Dark Side of the Inner Child Adult Problem State: Over-responsibility: \"I am respon- sible for others' experience, and I am responsible for what people think or feel about me.\" Adult Problem State: Loss of Boundary: \"It must have been something I did that caused them not to like me. This infantile trance has a pre-verbal assumption that two people are merged. For example, the infant sees herself and mom as one. In a relationship years later when the other wants to be separate, the infantile trance pops up leaving the adult confused and possibly with a fear of separation. Spiritualizing is a new way of looking at the defense system that occurs years later as the infant defends himself from being separate.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the beliefs we develop early in life about our responsibility for others' feelings can have a lasting impact on our relationships and sense of self. Recognizing and breaking free from these beliefs, and creating healthy boundaries can help us regain control of our own lives and emotional well-being. Remember, you are not responsible for other people's experiences or feelings, and your self-worth should not be dependent on external validation."
