  "title": "\"How can we develop a surplus of vital energy and use it to achieve success?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding part of this text, the author emphasizes the importance of developing a surplus potential of vital energy, which is not necessarily linked to muscular strength or physical constitution. The principle of alternation and conjunction of diverse energies is the key to success, and we must strike a balance between the voluntary and involuntary systems. The concept of \"vital erethism\" is discussed as a state of high nervous potential or surplus energy. The text highlights the mental aspect of neuric strength and urges readers to learn how to create and accumulate tension within a balanced organism to increase their capacity to venture into new directions.",
  "content": "Let us make it clear that developing vitality has nothing to do with muscular vigour or with the robustness of one’s physical constitution. The latter are desirable conditions, inasmuch as frequent diseases and muscular weakness represent causative agents of inferiority. Nevertheless, a 70-year old person might have greater vitality than a 20-year old one, since true vitality is a surplus, and as such equated to the scenario where one has in his bank account available cash to spend. What we are saying here, in fact, is that true consciousness of oneself and true will are rooted in a surplus of nervous tension (or neuric strength), which primarily consists in a mental aspect. What it is, then, that we should do? We must learn how to create and store away, how to accumulate tension within a balanced organism. This state is named “vital erethism”. We are immersed in a state of vital erethism whenever our nervous potential is high, in other terms, whenever we have some energy demanding to be released.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing vitality is not only about physical strength, but it also involves accumulating tension within a balanced organism to achieve a surplus of nervous potential or neuric strength. This mental aspect, known as \"vital erethism,\" leads to a state of alertness and activity, which can be experienced through gastric and muscular erethism. Thus, learning how to create and store away tension is crucial for achieving true consciousness and willpower, ultimately leading to a more vital and fulfilling life."
