  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how overwhelming parental expectations can create confusion and chaos within a child, leading to overgeneralization and relationship confusion later in life. The child may feel pressure to perform perfectly in tasks due to confusion becoming an automatic mechanism. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the concept of overgeneralization and how it limits individuals in present time. The overgeneralization made by the observer of the peanut butter and jelly example is stuck to the inner child, leading to limitations in life, such as hiring a cook or insisting a spouse does the cooking. This distortion is often present in relationships.",
  "content": "Confu- sion is placed on automatic by the observer, the observer goes to sleep and the inner child within the individual takes over and then fuses or associates confusion with tasks. 2. Over-generalization In this thinking distortion you make a broad generalized conclusion based on a single incident or piece of evi- Con-fusion â€¢ 97 dence.... A rejection on the dance floor means, \"Nobody will ever want to dance with me.... You are over-generaliz- ing when you absolutely conclude that, \"Nobody loves me, I'll never be able to trust anybody. Words that indicate you may be over-generalizing are: all, every, none, never, always, everybody, and nobody. (McKay, 1981:20) In the above peanut butter and jelly example, \"I always get overwhelmed when making food,\" the over-generalization made by the observer is stuck to the inner child and is frozen in time (age- regressed) and then over-generalized to limit life. Rather than learning how to cook, the child within a man might hire a cook or insist his spouse do the cooking. This limits the adult in present time. 3. Relationship Confusion Over-generalization is often present in relationships.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome confusion and over-generalization, it is important to identify the thinking distortions and replace them with more accurate and balanced thoughts. Recognize when you are using words that may be over-generalized, and challenge those thoughts, in order to be effective in present time. By doing so, you will be able to gain control of your life and achieve your goals with clarity and confidence."
