  "title": "\"How can visualization and mirror exercises help develop intuition and creativity?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we come across two visualization exercises that help to develop intuition and creativity. In Exercise 36, the writer emphasizes the importance of visualizing vivid pictures of our thoughts and how it leads to the emergence of creative ideas over time. Exercise 37 involves looking at a reflected light from a mirror to find inspiration for a given subject in mind. These exercises are based on the idea that during relaxed moments, the mind is more open to ideas that could be overlooked when occupied. In the final part (last 200 tokens) of the text, the writer highlights the significance of making room for higher dimensions and being open to support from the universe.",
  "content": "You might for example say to yourself: “I wonder how many different operational methods I can find which are suitable for this market”. Close your eyes. After a few moments, you might notice a luminous trace. Pay heed to the way the residual luminous light develops until it finally disappears, which should be around two minutes from then (As with the earlier exercise, you will notice the appearance of a luminous halo around). Open the eyes again, and write down now all the ideas that have sprung to your mind. Developing intuition through the medium of a mirror It is important to always make room for higher dimensions. Reflect about the fact that we are never alone and without support in the sea of immensity. Several studies which have been conducted on the subject of creativity have shown how there are some moments in which the best ideas surface, and which are represented by the moments when the mind and our usual ego are relaxed. Believe it or not, five minutes of quiet meditation amid the peace of some hermitage might be able to «produce» far more than what is brought about by many days of febrile activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing our intuition and creativity through simple exercises such as meditation and reflection can lead to amazing results. By making space for higher dimensions and finding moments of relaxation, we can tap into our subconscious and unlock ideas that we never thought possible. Remember, nourishing your soul is just as important as feeding your body, so take time to appreciate the beauty around you and allow yourself to dream."
