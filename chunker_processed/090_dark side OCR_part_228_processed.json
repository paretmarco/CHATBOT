  "title": "How Does the Inner Child Identity Impact Spiritualization and Specialness in Adults?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the inner child concept, and the impact it has on the spiritualizing process. The child creates a feeling of specialness as a way of dealing with neglect or abuse. The defense mechanism of specialness is often re-enforced by society. People on spiritual paths tend to feel special, superior, or chosen. This last 200 tokens provide some examples of how specialness operates in various situations. The text emphasizes the negative effects of this defense mechanism, such as feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and depression.",
  "content": "The child cannot process the chaos of neglect or abuse and so decides there must be a purpose, and as a reaction creates specialness. Specialness is a process in which the child creates a feeling of being special or different from others rather than dealing with her neglect or abuse. The defense of specialness is re-enforced by slogans like, \"You're special.\" Recall on the television comedy show Saturday Night Live, the Church Lady, in a sarcastic voice always said two things; \"Well, isn't that special,\" and \"feeling just a little bit superior.\" Notice how people on spiritual paths feel special, or chosen, or superior to everyone else. Recently at a workshop, a participant asked, \"How do I know if I'm in the inner child identity?\" I responded, \"When you feel special or different from others, you are in an identity.\" A few years ago a well-known therapist asked me, \"Suppose I like feeling special?\" I responded by saying, \"With the identity of feeling special comes the feelings of separation, disconnection, feeling like nobody understands, loneliness, alienation, and possibly depres- sion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the defense mechanisms we create as children to cope with neglect and abuse. While feeling special may temporarily alleviate the chaos we encounter, it ultimately leads to feelings of separation, disconnection, loneliness, and depression. By acknowledging and addressing our inner child identities, we can begin to heal from the traumas of our past and create fulfilling, authentic lives."
