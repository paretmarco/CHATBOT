  "title": "How Can Non-Verbal Communication Influence Multisensory Hypnosis and Ericksonian Hypnotherapy in Sales, Therapy, and Personal Development?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the concept of multisensory induction and hypnosis without words are discussed, showing how non-verbal communication can be used to create a powerful environment for inducing trance. The text also mentions the use of NLP 3, which emphasizes learning to be a neurolinguistic programmer, and how the different logical levels of analysis of reality can affect communication. In this last part, an example of a non-verbal induction is presented, showcasing the power of using sounds and meaningless words to avoid language barriers and allowing even the most rational people to react better to this kind of hypnosis.",
  "content": "Here is an example of a non verbal induction: The hypnotist (to subject): please stay there and don't move subject stay without moving The hypnotist begin to make some gesture and begin to use some strange, (not understable) words and sounds, and after some seconds the subject begin to sway The hypnotist follow him non verbally helping him to sway more The hypnotist catch the subject and place him on a seat The subject having stiff legs, the hypnotist make soothing passes and the subject relax himself The hypnotist begin the hypnotherapy part. We can call this kind of induction \"multisensory\" because we use more senses together and not just the words. It is very usefull to have the ability to use a multisensory induction. If sometime we find people that doesn't like certain words, or that do strange associations to common words this technique is very useful. The big power of the right use of sounds and meaningless words is to avoid such problems, giving each one what really want. The validity of this system is proved by the fact that it is the most ancient existing method of hypnosis. People extremely rational react better to this kind of hypnosis than to any other because they have no more possibility to rationalize what is happening. Obviously, these techniques are very useful too for hypnotist travelling abroad in non english speaking countries. A BIT OF THEORY Dave Elman defined hypnosis as \"the bypassing of the critical factor and the installing of selective thinking\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, multisensory hypnosis offers a powerful and effective method of inducing a deep state of hypnosis and promoting therapeutic change. By using non-verbal communication, such as paralinguistic, prossemic, kinesic, gaze, and digital elements, we can evoke emotional involvement in the client, break old schemas and install new ones, and give non-verbal suggestions. This method is useful for hypnotherapists seeking new ways of augmenting their effectiveness, those working in the spiritual field, and researchers of hypnosis. With the right use of non-verbal elements and submodalities work, we can achieve faster and easier therapeutic results."
