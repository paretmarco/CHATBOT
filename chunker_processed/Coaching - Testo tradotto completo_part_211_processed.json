  "title": "\"What are the exercises to nurture a relationship with the unconscious and develop intuition?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author suggests exercises that help to nurture a relationship with one's unconscious or deep inward essence. The exercises include being in a state of eurhythmy, relaxing deeply, and establishing contact with oneself. The author recommends directing attention to the area of the navel and using a finger to indicate affirmative or negative responses from the unconscious. This exercise can deepen the ability of the unconscious to expand and establish priority between different possible actions. The exercise can also be used to verify the correlation of previously demarcated ideas and ideals with oneself.",
  "content": "Direct your attention to the area of your navel. Ask your unconscious side to give you an affirmative or a negative reply through a slight motioning (by the fingers). Determine beforehand which finger corresponds to the \"yes\" answer. Ask your unconscious now whether it is able to hear. After a while, you will notice in your finger a movement taking place spontaneously. At that point, you might submit some questions to your deep inward being. This exercise might prove to be easy for some persons, whereas other people might need the assistance of a hypnotist capable of guiding them. This is one of the best exercises so as to nurture a relationship with oneâ€™s unconscious. The more, in fact, we develop a dialogue with it, the greater the ability of the unconscious to deepen and expand. The exercise is likewise useful for the sake of establishing a priority between different possible actions. Exercise 41: Verification of ideas and ideals Using again the method of the inner code, you should now verify once more the correlation of the previously demarcated ideas and ideals with your own selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a relationship with your unconscious mind through exercises like the inner code and finger movement technique can be useful in verifying ideas, establishing priorities, and making judgments. Additionally, nurturing the spirit of self-contradiction can aid in discovering truth and achieving balance between the benefits and harms of any decision. Remember, the more you dialogue with your unconscious, the more it will deepen and expand."
