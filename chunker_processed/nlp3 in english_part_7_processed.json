  "title": "How can multisensory induction be used in hypnosis and NLP, and what are the benefits of non-verbal communication in creating a powerful and effective client rapport?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the core of hypnosis, multisensory hypnosis and hypnosis without words. They explain that although hypnosis is often linked with the use of meaningful words, studies show that nonverbal communication is a much bigger part of our communication. The author also dives into the different nonverbal elements that can be used in a multisensory induction. The purpose of this induction is to get clients emotionally involved, change their schema of seeing things and giving nonverbal suggestions. The author categorizes the different nonverbal elements that can be used, including tone, inflection, distance, movement, hand movements, mesmeric passes and the social meaning of gaze.",
  "content": "We find this definition very useful, but we prefer to say, instead of saying \"bypassing the critical factor\" to say \"bypassing the normal schema of references and reactions of a person\". When we are in an enviroment where we don't know how to act properly, we will catch each suggestion we receive very rapidly, and we will adopt rapidly new schemas of action. But, in order to find the old schema unuseful and not sufficient we need to be emotionally involved in the situation. There are a lot of things we don't understand in the world, but we don't accept to say that our schema of analysis is insufficient until we are not emotionally involved. THE USE OF NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION IN A MULTISENSORY INDUCTION In a multisensory induction, we will adopt the non verbal communication for three purposes: 1. getting the clients emotionally involved 2. bringing him to change his schema of seeing things 3. giving non verbal suggestions For sake of simplicity, we can divide in categories the different non verbal elements we can use: Paralinguistic — Tone, inflection, and includes the power of no-meaning words Prossemic — The use of distance and movement in creating a social rapport Kinesic and gaze — Movements of the hands; Mesmeric passes; the social meaning of the gaze Digital — Discover the hidden power of touch Every verbal induction normally use some of the forementioned elements, but the most important thing is to integrate all of them together in a very powerful and strong blend at the same time understanding which is the most useful in a certain moment.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the use of non-verbal communication in multisensory hypnosis is a powerful tool for creating a deep and profound level of emotional involvement. By using elements of paralinguistic, prossemic, kinesic, gaze, and digital communication, hypnotherapists can bring about transformative change in their clients with astonishing results in just 2 to 4 minutes. Whether seeking to augment their therapeutic effectiveness, discover new ways of observing hypnotic phenomena, or sell a product, hypnotherapists and NLPers alike can benefit from incorporating the innovative techniques of Dr. Marco Paret into their practices."
