  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of the text, the concept of \"Trance-ference\" is discussed, which refers to projecting our own past traumas onto others. The author suggests intentionally creating a \"mom and dad\" mask to awaken the observer of the inner child and take charge of this automatic process. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of respecting and appreciating the inner child's defenses as early solutions to prior problems. However, it is acknowledged that waking up can be a painful process, as the trances were created to dull the pain of trauma. The concept of \"Con-fusion\" is also introduced, which occurs when the child is faced with an event that cannot be fully experienced or explained, leading to confusion.",
  "content": "This is 92 • The Dark Side of the Inner Child respecting and appreciating the inner child' s defenses as early solutions to prior problems, which have been dominating the subjective experience of present time. Furthermore, it cannot be overstated that waking up can be a painful process. Why? Because the observer created the trances to dull the pain of trauma. To awaken the observer, the pain of the trauma can no longer be denied or dulled. Hence, in the waking-up of the observer the trances must be acknowledged along with the denied trauma. It is only in that way that the awake observer can become an established state; or better said, an established non-state of trance-endence. • 10 Con-fusion: GettingLost In Spanish, the word \"con\" means \"with,\" so we might say that with fusion comes confusion. Confusion is the trance the observer creates and that occurs when the interaction in the family cannot be understood or inte- grated by the child. This happens when the observer and child are faced with an event, situation, or emotion that cannot be fully experienced. The child either resists experiencing the episode or he has no model to explain its occurrence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to recognize and honor our inner child's past defenses as solutions to previous problems, but it is crucial to awaken the observer's consciousness and acknowledge the trances and denied traumas. Only then can we establish an awakened state of trance-independence and break free from confusion and chaos to live a fulfilling life."
