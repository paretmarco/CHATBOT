  "title": "How can understanding desires as energy improve our relationship with them?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explains how desires arise as a way to resist unfelt experiences and how exploring them without judgment can lead to a deeper understanding. In this last part, the reader is invited to practice focusing on the energy of desire rather than the object being desired, and to delabel and experience it as energy. The author, Singh, answers a student's question and emphasizes that there's neither good nor bad about desireâ€”it is just energy. Through an example, the reader is reminded to work with any desire coming into their awareness, such as the desire for a new car.",
  "content": "Notice what the object or situation or experience looks and sounds like. Feel or notice sensations and feelings, the sensations inside your body associated with that particular desire. Notice its size and shape. Take the label off and see it as energy. Focus your awareness CM the desire inside you, the energy or sensations called \"desire\" inside, rather than on the desired object. Pull your attention inside to the desire itself, delabel it, and experience it as energy, allowing It (the energy) to do whatever it does. Simply watch the desire as energy inside you. A student asked if he should see desire as something negative. I replied that desire is desire. There is no bad or good about it, it's just energy. I would suggest that as you go through your life in the next few days, you work with any desire coming into your awareness. Suppose you are driving your car and you notice a new Porsche, or you might see a Porsche in your mind's eye. For that moment, your desire is called, \"I want a Porsche.\"",
  "last_phrase": "Instead of constantly chasing external manifestations of our desires, try turning your attention towards the desire itself as pure energy. Observe it, de-label it, and simply notice the sensations and feelings associated with it. By doing this, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our desires, enabling us to live a more conscious and fulfilling life. Remember, desire is just energy, there is no good or bad about it."
