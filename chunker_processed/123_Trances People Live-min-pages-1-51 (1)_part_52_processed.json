  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Deep Trance Phenomena can help individuals to better understand and address their behaviors by tapping into emotions and perceptions. By using techniques such as age regression and visualization, individuals can identify patterns that were once created for survival purposes but are no longer benefiting them. A skilled practitioner can guide the individual through the process of exploring their sensations and thoughts, leading to a deeper sense of self-awareness and potential for change."
