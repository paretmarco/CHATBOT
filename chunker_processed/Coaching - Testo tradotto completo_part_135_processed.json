  "title": "How can we overcome the encumbrance of our ego to achieve true freedom and success?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this essay, the author delves deeper into the concept of overcoming one's ego, which is regarded as the biggest hurdle to realizing one's true potential. The author highlights the Tao Te King's view on how focusing excessively on ourselves can consume our mental energy and prevent us from seeing the world. The text emphasizes the importance of being objective with ourselves and our external circumstances, realizing our minimal significance while also being attentive to what lies outside us. The author stresses that in retreating from the self and not turning ourselves into the center of attention, we attain perfection and true success.",
  "content": "Our specific importance is limited to the portion of space occupied by our body in the Universe, and is never too much of a thing, whichever way we turn it to 39. It is therefore absurd to pretend that we also occupy a place in somebody elseâ€™s soul, or demand gratitude, affection, or what is even worse, recollection and loyalty after our death, when our body will have returned to the nothingness it had just now exited for a short while only. True Man advances by Retreating / He is always present by Staying outside / By not turning himself into the centre he attains perfection (Tao Te king) We ought to be objective with our own selves and our external circumstances as they factually exist in time and space, so as for us to perceive our minimal significance while at the same time realizing that precisely due to that fact we are able to do a lot. The state of permanent attention which is predominantly focused on our own selves and circumstances does in fact engender a pronounced neglect of external things, a neglect which accrues to our detriment. The accessing key to true success is to be found instead in being attentive to what lies outside us.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by recognizing our minimal significance in the grand scheme of things and focusing less on ourselves, we can open ourselves up to the world around us and improve our social relationships. True success and a sense of freedom are achieved by being present and attentive to the needs of others, rather than demanding attention and loyalty to ourselves. So let us retreat from our egos and embrace the outer world, for it is there that we can find our true purpose and fulfillment."
