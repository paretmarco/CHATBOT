  "first_phrase": "In the first part of this text, we discussed the concept of computational propaganda and the methods used to influence public opinion on social media. The second part explored the ethical implications of these tactics, particularly in the context of the 2016 US presidential election. \n\nIn the final 200 tokens of this text, we examine how the use of computational propaganda has evolved in recent years. Specifically, we discuss the use of \"deepfakes\" and other forms of manipulated media to spread disinformation. We also explore the potential consequences of these tactics for democracy and suggest ways in which we can protect ourselves against their harmful effects. Throughout this section, we reference the work of researchers and scholars in the field, including Joan Donovan and Yochai Benkler.",

  "last_phrase": "In summary, over the course of five days, we have explored a variety of techniques for emotional and mental wellness, including body scans, visualization, light therapy, and self-hypnosis. We have learned about different ways of working with emotions and attachments, past lives, and parallel lives. We have practiced fusion and defusion, worked with the Polyvagal theory and the endocrine system, and learned about the three main types of trance. We have also explored techniques for setting and achieving goals. With these tools, we are better equipped to improve our emotional and mental well-being and lead more fulfilling lives."
