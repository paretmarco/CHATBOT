  "title": "What is the importance of acknowledging human limitations and ordinary nature in true spirituality?",
  "first_phrase": "This section addresses the issue of premature merging in spiritual teachings and practices, and how it reinforces narcissism and infantile beliefs about the self. The author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and integrating all aspects of the self, including the animal and emotional nature. They also argue that true spirituality involves awareness of the underlying unity and ESSENCE of being, as well as the external world. The author believes that the narcissist's salvation comes from realizing their human ordinariness and expressing their gifts from that place.",
  "content": "It is at this difficult juncture when the individual first fully appreciates his separation, deals emotionally with the impact of that reality, and is called upon to integrate his magnificence with his vulnerability. This rapprochement with reality represents the individual's first attempt to reconcile an idealized dream, which includes the illusions of symbiosis and grandiosity, with the realities of existence, which include separateness and limitation (Ibid., p. 41) The narcissist's salvation is not in his accomplishments, specialness, or uniqueness. The \"drama of the gifted child\" (Miller, 1981) is in his discovery of his human orditiariness. In that ordinariness is his ability to feel real human feelings unaffected by his internalized (or externalized) parents' acceptance or rejection of his feelings. Once his ordinariness is realized, he can express his gift as just that--a gift. His gift is not who he is but humanness is who he is. (Ibid. p. 49) ________________ Special Section In Quantum Psychology, true spirituality is to be aware of the underlying unity, aware of your ESSENCE, aware of your psycho-emotional nature, aware of your animal nature and aware of the external world, etc.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve true spirituality in Quantum Psychology, one should be aware of their psycho-emotional, animal and external nature, as well as their underlying unity with humanity. It is essential to transition from the merger with Mom to one's ordinariness and vulnerability, or else we risk seeking spiritual solace in objecthood."
