  "title": "How does self-hypnosis benefit traders in managing stress and improving intuition in the unpredictable markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, we learned about the power of self-hypnosis in dealing with stress, anxiety and improving oneself. In this section, the author explains how self-hypnosis can be a useful tool for traders in understanding the markets. The markets cannot be analyzed accurately by a linear model due to the convergence of individual psychologies belonging to multiple traders. However, by \"becoming related\" to the market through self-hypnosis, traders can develop intuitions and achieve results that would not be otherwise possible. The author emphasizes the importance of creative personal improvement over mere competitiveness with one's external environment. This way of thinking will allow traders to access their own resources and to use them in novel ways.",
  "content": "The direction which personal improvement takes, as far as the trader is concerned, is always a creative direction, that is, a direction of accessing our own resources: It is absolutely necessary, therefore, to ensure that every effort is aimed at creativity, as opposed to a mere spirit of competitiveness vis-à-vis the external environment. The truth is in fact that forcing ourselves to move along a direction of mere competition with the world (as with the person who says, ‘I want to fare better than my colleague X!’) has only the effect of letting us employ the resources which are already available in a different manner, without taking us, however, to the point where we might create novel resources. Given that the process of utilizing resources which are already there is essentially rational and conscious, that process distances us from the possibility of finding a successful outlet for our subconscious resources: Though we might no doubt manage to achieve temporary results, we simultaneously risk focusing upon erroneous directions, thereby laying waste to several possibilities.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, personal improvement for traders should always aim towards accessing their own creative resources rather than a competitive spirit towards the external environment. Through self-hypnosis, traders can reduce stress and improve their psycho-physical balance, ultimately leading to greater efficiency in the market. Defining guiding objectives and staying in harmony with oneself should always be the first priority for any self-improvement techniques."
