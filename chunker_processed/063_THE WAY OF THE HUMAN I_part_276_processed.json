  "title": "How does the belief of controlling our animal urges affect our sense of self and the external world?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the false beliefs formed by the brain which lead to the formation of the \"False Self Compensator.\" It talks about the belief that controlling one's animalistic urges will lead to getting what one wants from the external world and that the collapse of this belief can lead to chaos. The last part of the text explains the False Core Conclusion #2: \"I am Crazy,\" and the compensation method of trying to prove sanity and virtue. The text highlights the importance of identifying and challenging these false beliefs to achieve self-awareness and growth.",
  "content": "\"I am in control\" or \"I have to be in control\" is a solution based on a false conclusion which covers and hides this and/or does not let it (the animal) show itself. In this situation, you project the animal out onto another and try to control them, or I'm going to be the animal and I imagine (project) they are going to try to control me and hence resist them. CHAOS Chaos occurs when we try to control basic animal urges that have been defined by society or religion as inappropriate. In this way, unwanted chaos and conflict get fused with our Animal Nature. 169 The next biological False Conclusion formed by the newer brain. FALSE CORE CONCLUSION #2: \"I am Crazy.\" FALSE SELF COMPENSATOR: I Have to Prove I am not Crazy and be Sane, Clear, Healthy, Virtuous, etc. False Core Conclusion #2 is, \"I am crazy\" because I have these sensations, urges, drives, etc. The False Self Compensator tries to prove you are not crazy and attempts to \"act sane,\" rational, and \"healthy,\" \"virtuous\", etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to acknowledge and embrace our primal urges and animal nature, rather than suppressing or controlling them, as it can lead to chaos and a false belief that we are crazy. By accepting ourselves fully, we can avoid false conclusions and live in harmony with our biology, ultimately leading to a healthier and more fulfilling life. Remember, you are in control, but true control comes from understanding and accepting all aspects of ourselves."
