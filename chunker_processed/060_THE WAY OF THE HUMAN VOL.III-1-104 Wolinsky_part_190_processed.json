  "title": "\"What are ideas that the 'I' has about 'mine' in a therapeutic context?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Wolinsky and Paula explored the concept of \"me\" and \"not-me\" using the idea of \"emptiness\". They found that there is a cosmic superimposition whereby the \"I\" becomes \"me\" and \"void\" becomes \"not-me\". In the final 200 tokens, they continued to dismantle the ideas around \"me\" and explored the concept of \"no-state-state of I AM\" and the \"NOT-I-I\". By differentiating and switching the Not-\"me\"-\"me\", they were able to open up the No-State-state of I AM.",
  "content": "Just for fun, notice that there is no me, and decide that the me is me and the EMPTINESS is NOT-ME. Paula:Okay. Wolinsky:Now, stop believing that and realize that that EMPTINESS is me and the me is not me. Paula:(no response) Wolinsky:No words? Paula:I can say but it won't really say it. Therapeutic Note She let go of the concept of \"me\" by first differentiating and then switching the Not-\"me\"-\"me\". You have ideas about \"me\", \"me\" being your \"me\". So you are bringing into awareness and dismantling the ideas you have about \"me\" and what happens is this opens up the No-State-state of I AM and the NOT-I-I. What happened was that at \"some point\" EMPTINESS condensed down and created a concept of \"me\" and itself (VOID) as Not-\"me.\" So all we are doing is reversing the process so you get that the EMPTINESS is \"me\" and this is not \"me\".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, letting go of the concept of \"me\" can be liberating as it opens up the No-State-state of I AM and NOT-I-I. By dismantling the ideas we have about \"me\" and realizing that EMPTINESS is \"me\" and this is not \"me,\" we can free ourselves from limiting beliefs and embrace a more expansive sense of self."
