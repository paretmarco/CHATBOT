  "title": "\"How can intentional creation benefit the inner child stuck in anxiety during a divorce settlement?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses how the inner child within us can create anxiety and fear during times of change or stress. Using a case example, the author suggested intentionally creating the inner child and its accompanying fears to awaken the observer's creative aspect. By doing so, the observer can take charge of the panicked inner child and realize their role as the creator of their reality. The author also introduced the concept of \"Planning\" as a form of futurizing that occurs when the child cannot express their feelings to their parents. The last part of the text delves into a famous writer who put down his father in his book.",
  "content": "After creating it intentionally, she took charge of the panicked inner child and realized that she was the observer/ creator of it, hence she could stop creating it. The most important task of the observer is to create the inner child intentionally. This is the reason noted physicist John Wheeler changed the word observer in physics to the word participator. Why? Because the observer not only observes; the observer also participates in the creation of internal subjective reality. The intentional creation of the experience makes it possible to choose. You awaken the observer to its creative aspect by asking the observer to create intentionally and knowingly, that which they are creating unknowingly. The observer has been sleeping and is hypnotized. By having the observer create his own trance, the observer awakens to its creative aspect. 3. Planning \"Planning\" is a form of futurizing that occurs when the child cannot tell her parents how she feels. She imagines a time in the future when she tells her parents how she feels and the parents understand and admit they were wrong. I saw a very famous writer in Santa Cruz, who wrote a book putting his famous father down.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, awakening the observer to its creative aspect is a powerful tool for intentional creation and shaping of our internal subjective reality. By gaining awareness and taking charge of our thoughts, we can prevent unconsciously creating negative experiences. The most important task is to create the inner child intentionally and knowingly to choose the reality we desire. Planning, as a form of futurizing, can be harmful or useful, depending on the intention behind it. Ultimately, intentional creation empowers us to shape our reality and live a fulfilling life."
