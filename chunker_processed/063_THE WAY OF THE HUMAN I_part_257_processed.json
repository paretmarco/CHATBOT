  "title": "What are the Pitfalls of Repressing Biological Urges for Spiritual and Social Acceptance?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author clarifies that sleep and sexuality are basic biological needs that cannot be denied, and suggests that the repression of such needs can lead to psychological disturbance. The author points out that spiritual systems often promote the idea of enlightenment through deprivation of basic biological urges. However, this concept of spiritualization by repression can lead to a distorted understanding of spirituality. In the final 200 tokens, the author discusses the idea of substitution in therapy, where repressed biological drives are substituted for socially acceptable behaviors. The author warns against this approach, highlighting two major pitfalls: a lack of satisfaction or completion, and the emergence of suppressed impulses in other ways.",
  "content": "In Quantum Psychology we are not talking about \"acting it out\" as if imagining expressing sexuality equals liberationâ€”as some gurus suggest. We are not talking about the repression-expression continuum. We are talking about taking the label off and being with the energy of it. Many forms of therapy consider substitution a \"good\" thing. For Quantum Psychology, substitution can be repressing some basic animal drive and substituting it for some socially acceptable behavior. For example, let's say when you expressed sexuality as a child, you were rebuked by your parents but when you expressed interests in achievement and success, you were rewarded. You then substitute sexual impulse for achievement. Some say this is \"good.\" Quantum Psychology suggests two major pitfalls: That the achievement never reaches a state of satisfaction or completion (climax). 2.The repressed-substituted sexual impulse comes out in other ways. First of all, substitution yields no satisfaction, it only yields more escalating substitution (i.e., driving for more and more success). Secondly, as homeopathic medicine suggests, sexual and other impulses do not go away with substitution but create a supression and sometimes a perversion of symptoms, since the energy must come out in some way.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Quantum Psychology challenges the notion that \"acting it out\" or substituting basic animal drives for socially acceptable behaviors is beneficial. Instead, it advocates for being present with the energy and taking the label off. The pitfalls of substitution include the achievement never reaching a state of satisfaction or completion and the repressed-substituted impulse surfacing in other ways. By understanding these concepts, one can avoid falling into the trap of substitution and find true fulfillment."
