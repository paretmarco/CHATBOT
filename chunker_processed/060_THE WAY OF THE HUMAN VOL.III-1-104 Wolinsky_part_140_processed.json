  "title": "\"What is the Difference Between a True Archetype and a Repressed Spiritualization in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author explains the concept of false archetypes and how they are a result of repressed spirituality. The author draws a distinction between true archetypes, which come from the void of undifferentiated consciousness, and false archetypes, which arise from a more solidified and defended place. The author notes that spiritualized people may appear spacious but are actually rigidified and defended. The author also explains the idea of universal psychological dissociative defenses, which become false archetypes. All of these concepts are explained within the framework of quantum psychology.",
  "content": "Those Archetypes which express repressed dissociative spirituality move from conscious or unconscious solidity to the illusion of spirituality, which is even more solidity. In other words when we move from the bottom to the illusion of up going to the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, we are actually moving down and becoming more solid and defensive.' This is why spiritualized people are so rigidified. They appear more spacious when actually they are more rigidified and defended. This explains why people who are more spiritualized have so many rules and regulations and such a rigidified life. 'It should be noted there is no top or bottom. Here we are saying top meaning less solid, thinned-out or pure VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Quantum Psychology is only discussing it in this way as a discussion. Because whether it is solid, thinned-out or more solid, it is still only the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (see Chapter V, the VOID). ________________ Chapter HI Then why we are certain things are so universal? Because there seems to be universal psychological dissociative defenses which become spiritualized False Archetypes. This, of course, is only true if we as the VOID use the lens of Archetypesâ€”NO LENSES NO ARCHETYPES.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey towards spirituality can often result in rigidity and defensiveness, stemming from the creation of false archetypes formed as dissociative defenses. It is important to remember that there is no top or bottom, only varying degrees of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. By understanding and acknowledging these universal psychological defenses, we can work towards true spiritual growth and understanding."
