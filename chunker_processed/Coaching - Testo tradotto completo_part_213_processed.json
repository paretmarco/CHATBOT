  "title": "How can we develop the faculty of observation and discover new opportunities?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author describes different exercises one can perform to improve their self-awareness and ability to make better decisions. They suggest developing the faculty of judging things through a single glance, nurturing the spirit of self-contradiction, and focusing on a task with deliberate attention. Additionally, it is emphasized that organizing one's time can lead to discovering new opportunities and achieving one's goals. The author advises being interested in as many subjects as possible, which can help develop the imagination and lead to seeing things from multiple perspectives. This way of thinking might potentially bring about meaningful changes in one's life.",
  "content": "If one wants to be an achiever, if the discovery of new ways is something desired, it is then imperative to keep the eyes constantly open. Be present to your own selves and to the reality around you. Read, watch, observe, and reflect. Enlarge the scope of your mental interests. Seek information about every kind of subject. That is the path leading to a simultaneous increase in knowledge and power. The most potent incentive to observe is having an interest. Being interested stimulates the imagination. Whoever is interested in a matter does not limit his self to seeing the thing in itself, but moves from there into the further step of discerning all those aspects which are related to it. A certain object, the most mundane situation, might then offer several perspectives which are pregnant with potential results.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve success and discover new opportunities, one must keep their eyes open to the reality around them. By being present, reading, observing, and reflecting, individuals can broaden their mental interests and seek information on every subject. A potent incentive to observe is having an interest, which stimulates the imagination and allows for discerning different aspects related to a subject. Rediscovering wonderment and asking why in every situation, as well as learning from everyone, are essential strategies for improving one's faculty of observation."
