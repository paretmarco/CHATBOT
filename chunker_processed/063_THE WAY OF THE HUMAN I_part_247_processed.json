  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, Quantum Psychology principle of spiritual experience was discussed, stating that any ideas we have about spirituality are not spirituality, which is a no-experience experience. In this final part, the author introduces the concept of biological core yoga, a natural yoga that happens once the awareness is restored, and the core is accessed from the inside out. The author also highlights the importance of not practicing yoga from the outside to appear a certain way, but to move from the BIOLOGICAL CORE.",
  "content": "Because of the awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE, there is a natural walking around, daily awareness a free no state-state, which means that there is No-I. Actually there is no meditation because there is No-I meditating. There is no longer any internal considering, no voices or internal dialogue and no more interruptions in emotions, i.e., the outward motion. That is core yoga. It is Taoist yoga. It is Buddhist yoga and with it, the you you call yourself ends. There Chapter VIII are no more trances or, better said, TRANCE-ENDING occurs naturally, In other words, when you are ready to meditate, meditation is not necessary. Unfortunately, sometimes people practice yoga from outside of themselves so that their bodies can look a certain way, appear a certain way, or act a certain way. This is not core yoga. Core yoga is about moving from the BIOLOGICAL CORE which is from inside out. If you have Yoga teachers who are trying to get you in particular positions or postures so that you \"look\" a certain way, you are doing yoga from your sleeve and the postures are dissociative postures.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, core yoga is about moving from your biological core, inside out, and eliminating the false identities that lead to a noisy mind. The purpose of Hatha Yoga is much deeper than just improving physical health or looking a certain way. It is a way to achieve inner peace and tranquility, without the need for external validation or achievement. So, focus on the core and let go of external distractions to achieve true yoga practice."
