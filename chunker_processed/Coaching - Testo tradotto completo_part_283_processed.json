  "first_phrase": "In this section, the importance of managing energy efficiently is outlined. The text explains that each day has its own unique emotional color that is influenced by various factors including physical disposition and aspirations for the future. To effectively manage energy, it is essential to accurately assess the availability and type of energy throughout the day. The text also suggests adopting a cyclical system of energy management rather than linearly expending all energy until exhaustion. By implementing these strategies, individuals can attain a higher degree of productivity and efficiency.",
  "content": "Managing energy in the course of the day In order to reach our daily objectives, a further essential requirement is to accurately manage our energy. The plan will have to take that factor into consideration. It is imperative, for the sake of attaining the highest degree of efficiency, that the different actions we are called upon to carry out should in fact be programmed in such a way as to bear in mind the energy that is factually available to us, as the level of that energy is never the same, nor is it of an invariably similar kind. Energy in cyclical form Many people work indefatigably, until they feel tired and cannot go on any more. This is, however, nothing other than an improper use of forces, one which, moreover, occasions a significant waste of time, given that, when we are worn out, our productivity becomes progressively lower. Too often we spend energy in a linear way, that is, without subsequent recoveries, until we reach breaking point. It is instead necessary to espouse a CYCLICAL system of managing energy.",
  "last_phrase": "To maximize efficiency and productivity, it is important to manage your energy levels throughout the day. Instead of working until exhaustion, adopt a cyclical system of managing energy. Incorporating the principles of oscillation and effort into your plan can help you achieve your daily goals without burning out. Remember: energy is not constant, so plan accordingly."
