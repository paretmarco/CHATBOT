  "title": "What is the role of focal and ambient vision in object recognition and spatial orientation, and how can peripheral vision be affected to alter perception and attention?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the role of focal and ambient vision in our visual perception, with focal vision being responsible for object recognition and ambient vision for spatial orientation. It also explores binocular function and the use of peripheral movements to affect the perception of body position. In the last 200 tokens, the author focuses on how observing fast movement with alternate eyes can alter binocular function, and how using hands as a visual cue can increase attention and affect balance. Additionally, moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can also have an impact on the sense of body position.",
  "content": "The same can happen when flying an aircraft and performing a task such as interpreting radar contact information on a HUD. Focal vision is used to consciously decipher task-oriented information while peripheral information is subconsciously used to maintain spatial orientation.\" GOING BEYOND THREE DIMENSIONAL REALITY Altering binocular function Binocular functions refer to the ability of the eyes to coordinate their activity so that we can merge the visual fields of both eyes into one distinct image. The most commonly observed aspects of binocular functions include convergence (the ability of the two eyes to team and focus on the same object), and accommodations (the ability of the eyes to shift their focus from near point to far point or vice versa). Each eye can have normal acuity (20/20 vision) but unless the eyes team, visual functions are impaired; <in observing very fast one eye after the other it seems that we alter binocular functions. AWAKENING LEFT SIDE OF VISION - WORKING ON THE LEFT EYE HANDS AS VISUAL CUE TO INCREASE ATTENTION USING PERIPHERAL MOVEMENTS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF BODY POSITION Moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can result in affecting the sense of balance.",
  "last_phrase": "Try incorporating peripheral movements into your daily routine to improve your peripheral vision and sense of balance. By awakening your left side of vision and increasing your attention, you can alter your binocular functions, resulting in enhanced visual functions. Don't forget, in some professions, such as flying a plane, being able to use your peripheral vision is crucial for maintaining spatial orientation."
