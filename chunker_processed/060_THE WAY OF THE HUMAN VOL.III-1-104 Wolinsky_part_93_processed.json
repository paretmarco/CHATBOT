  "title": "How is the \"personal self\" related to the Physics Dimensions and Forces in Hindu Yoga tradition and modern physics?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, the author explores the idea of the \"play\" or interaction of physics dimensions and forces, and how they ultimately manifest as archetypes and \"a personal me\" or \"a personal you.\" This idea is not new, and it has been reflected in the Hindu Yoga tradition through the \"play of the elements\" and the \"play of the gunas (forces).\" Ultimately, everything we are and everything we think we are is subject to and made from these interactions, but they are ultimately made from THAT ONE SUBSTANCE or NOTHINGNESS.",
  "content": "In the Hindu Yoga tradition, they refer to the world and what you call \"you\" as a \"play of the elements\" (i.e., air, earth, water, fire and ether). The forces, which they call gunas, contain Tama Guna (force) representing the inert force Sattva Guna (force) representing purity, and Raja Guna, (force) representing activity. According to Hindu Yoga everything (including us) occurs through the \"play\" (interaction) of the elements and the \"play of the 86 Chapter III gunas (forces).\" The Bhagavad Gita says that we are all subject to this play or interaction. Nisargadatta Maharaj once said to me, \"Even the physical form of the Guru is subject to the play (interaction) of the Gunas (forces).\" In other words, we, our bodies and all we think we are, are subject to, and part of, and are made from these interactions, but which ultimately are only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE not two (hence, Advaita).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, whether we describe the universe and ourselves as a \"play of the elements\" and \"gunas\" or as a \"symphony\" of vibrating strings containing the Physics Dimensions, the concept remains the same: all is interconnected and made of the same substance. Understanding and embracing this truth can enable us to live more harmoniously and purposefully in the world."
