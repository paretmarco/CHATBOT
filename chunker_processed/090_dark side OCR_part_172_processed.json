  "title": "What is the importance of trance dreaming and interrupting the inner child's hypervigilant identity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the focus was on how one's hypervigilant inner child can hamper trance dreaming. Further, people continue to live versions of their unfinished childhood themes. This last part delves deeper into identifying the critical shift required to bring the dream into reality. It discusses the therapist's role in distinguishing between what is real and what is not in present time. It also highlights the importance of developing the skill of trance dreaming to interrupt the inner child's hypervigilant identity. The author highlights how some creative ideas come out of this new skill and how not dreaming or interrupting one's dreaming undermines one's ability to dream.",
  "content": "Years go by and she forgets that she is a little child in the dreams. Now she is 30 and not ready to live the dream. A critical shift in viewpoint is required; the old dream puts her in conflict with the reality of today. At this point the therapist starts bringing the dream into a level of reality organiza- tion, i.e., what's real and what's not real, in present time. If you do not dream or have interrupted your dreaming, it' s critical to work with yourself to develop the skill of trance dream- ing; this interrupts the inner child's hypervigilant identity. Some creative ideas will come out of this new skill. Self-interruptions, invented in childhood, undermine peoples' ability to dream. Parents give many suggestions when they say, \"Be realistic,\" which means, \"See the world the way I see it.\" The child stops himself from ever really going into his own dream state.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, tapping into the skill of trance dreaming can interrupt the hypervigilant identity of our inner child and open the door to creative solutions. By challenging our old dreams and bringing them into present reality, we can shift our viewpoint and live a more fulfilling life. It's never too late to embrace your dreams and create a new identity, one that is aligned with your true self."
