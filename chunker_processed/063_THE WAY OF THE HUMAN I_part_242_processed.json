  "title": "\"What is the Quantum Psychology principle of the Biological Core and its importance for multi-dimensional awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of the BIOLOGICAL CORE in Quantum Psychology, stating that the greater one's connection to it, the more one experiences unity and pure being at a biological level. The text explains that the BIOLOGICAL CORE is the vehicle for the thinking and feeling dimensions, and that working with it is essential for maintaining a connection to the unity that moves through it. The last 200 tokens delve into the archetypal meaning of the BIOLOGICAL CORE as the meeting place between heaven and earth, which represent father/God and mother archetypes respectively.",
  "content": "Quan- 149 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness turn Psychology says that the degree to which you cannot be in your BIOLOGICAL CORE is the degree you get more into random thoughts, more into breakages, more imbalances, more energetic interruptions, more trancing-out, more into spiritualization and more disconnected from the other dimensions of your humanity. For this reason, from a Quantum Psychology perspective, the BIOLOGICAL CORE is a core dimension that needs to be worked with, acknowledged, and explored so that wherever your awareness is, i.e., ESSENCE, thinking level, etc., you can stay connected with the underlying unity which moves through the BIOLOGICAL CORE. Without this, your connection becomes disjointed, there are breakages and your realization of THAT becomes an idea, a concept rather than pure IS -NES S. ARCHETYPES AND THE BIOLOGICAL CORE When Quantum Psychology suggests that the BIOLOGICAL CORE is the meeting place between heaven (the sun) and earth, this can also be seen archetypically. The sun (metaphorically and archetypically) represent the father or God and the earth (metaphorically and archetypically) represent the mother.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, maintaining a connection with your biological core is essential for developing multi-dimensional awareness and achieving unity consciousness. Working with and acknowledging this core dimension is necessary in order to prevent disconnection and imbalance in your spiritual journey. Remember, honoring both the sun and the earth, and maintaining a straight posture from the core in yoga, are practical ways to stay connected with your biological core."
