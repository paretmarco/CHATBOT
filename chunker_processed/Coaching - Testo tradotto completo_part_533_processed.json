  "first_phrase": "This text teaches us how to attain control over ourselves and focus our energy towards achieving our goals. It advocates for understanding our specific ideal and arranging our actions logically in conformity with their necessity, urgency, and importance. It also stresses exercising an automatic control over our actions, carrying out indispensable actions consciously, and perfecting the system until we can derive maximum benefit from the universe. The last part, divided into sections, discusses suitable tactics for interpersonal relationships, contractual transactions, financial markets, and developing intuition generally. The method espoused by this text is the art of mentally discovering the shortest straight line that connects desire to result.",
  "content": "There can only be a single straight line to get to a point: All the other lines are indeed longer. Divisions of the work 1) Part One: Attaining self-control It is important to know how we can achieve control over our own selves. Many activities that we undertake are simply useless, when they are not in fact actually counterproductive. They are the actions which result in a dispersion of that energy that might be otherwise used in a more profitable way. The first step, therefore, consists in attaining consciousness over what we do. Every action that we carry out represents in fact the utilization of some part of our vital force. We must learn how to focus that energy. In order for us to do this, we must be capable of getting to the centre of our own selves. Thereafter, having located our centre, we should then move to the demarcation of all the rest, for us to set out once more on our journey.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving self-control is the key to success in life. By learning to focus our energy and simplify our thoughts and actions, we can avoid becoming dispersed and make the most of our vital force. Through conscious awareness and deliberate practice, we can attain mastery over ourselves and reach our goals with greater clarity and purpose. Remember: there can only be one straight line to get to a point, and it's up to us to choose the path that will get us there most efficiently."
