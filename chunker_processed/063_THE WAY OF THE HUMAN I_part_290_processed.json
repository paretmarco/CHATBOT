  "title": "What is the significance of internalizing suppressed energies and how can they be dealt with?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Nancy explored her thoughts and emotions related to her False Core belief. Now, in a session with Wolinsky, Nancy is asked to focus on the energy in her body and notice the energy inside the buffer of the numbness. After feeling the sparkly energy in her genitals, she is asked to absorb the energy from her little girl image to release the containment and allow the girl to have the container. Nancy suggests sharing the container and energy with the little girl through an energetic link between them. This exercise is a part of \"The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness\" by Wolinsky.",
  "content": "Let this little girl have this \"dance\" with your mother and for you to absorb the energy that she had to hold and repress. Nancy:Yes. Wolinsky:How do you feel? Nancy:Contained again a little bit but it's more diffused. Wolinsky:Do you feel the energy in your body? Nancy:The containment around my energy is more dif- fused but it feels good, it feels safe. And there's a feeling of concern for the little girl who doesn't have that. Wolinsky:Who does not have the container? 182 Chapter VIII Nancy:She doesn't have the container because I have the container. Wolinsky:How would it be if you gave her the container and let her have the container and you take the energy? Nancy: Wolinsky: Nancy: Wolinsky: Do you suppose we could share it? The container, the energy or both? Both. Okay. Have like an energetic link between you in present time and over there at three or four. So have an energetic, link between you both.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of sharing and dispersing the container and energy between the little girl and Nancy allows for healing and growth to take place. It highlights the importance of recognizing and breaking patterns of emotional suppression that can be passed down from generation to generation. By acknowledging and releasing buried energy, we can lead a more fulfilling and authentic life."
