  "title": "\"What is the difference between dissociation and witnessing in spiritual and psychological contexts?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This part of the text explores the idea of dissociation versus witnessing and how they relate to spirituality. Before this, the writer discussed dissociation in children and how it is an unconscious protection mechanism from negative emotions. They also mentioned how meditation can be misused as a way of dissociating from uncomfortable feelings. In this section, the author discusses the schizoid's adaptation to an insufficiently nourishing environment, which involves internal migration and distance from accessible living. They suggest that body work and yoga can help the schizoid feel their body before dismantling identities. The section concludes with the idea that resistance to separation and individuation can lead to a desire for unconscious union, often manifesting as a spiritual trance.",
  "content": "And it is certainly true that many abused people have found solace in meditation because the disidentification that is the goal of many Eastern approaches seems so similar to the patterns of dissociation underlying their own emotional lives. The schizoid's adaptation to an insufficiently nourishing, indeed punitive, environment is to internally migrate. The false, compensatory self of the schizoid person is characterized by distance rather than by grounded, accessible living. (Johnson, 1987, p. 19) In Quantum Psychology, the schizoid must do lots of body work, such as Rolfing and Feldenkrais, coupled with an ongoing practice of yoga. This will enable them to feel their body first, before moving onto dismantling identities. In fact, in Quantum Psychology workshops, I always suggest that people get ongoing body work, as a way to integrate the Quantum work into a daily walking-around, integrative experience. ________________ THE DESIRE FOR UNION It is the resistance to the natural biological merger-separation process, particularly separation and individuation that causes the spiritualized trance of trying to return to unconscious union, often with the mother later spiritualized as God or a relationship (soulmate).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the journey towards healing and wholeness requires a willingness to face the patterns of dissociation and resistance to separation that underlie our emotional lives. For those struggling with the schizoid's adaptation, incorporating body work and yoga into daily life can be a powerful step towards dismantling false identities and embracing grounded, accessible living. Recognizing the difference between the drive to merge with a partner or guru and the true no-me state of samadhi is key to avoiding spiritualized dissociation and instead experiencing authentic union with self and others."
