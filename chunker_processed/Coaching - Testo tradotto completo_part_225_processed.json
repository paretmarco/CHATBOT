  "title": "How can we use self-suggestion to achieve desired outcomes and create a logical life plan?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author emphasizes the importance of taking a small voluntary initiative towards achieving one's goals. Using the example of meeting a person who instills fear, the author suggests that prior visualization of the conversation through fantasy, concentration, and spiritual prayer can confer near-mathematical certainty of success. However, if one fails to make the effort to leave the house and meet the person, the auto-suggestion would result in an undiluted loss. The author also suggests developing alternative imaginations to deal with unexpected situations. Overall, the text highlights the significance of having different ideals for each person and a logical life plan that enables living each day as if it were the last.",
  "content": "Were I, however, not to decide in favour of making this small voluntary effort of setting out of my house for the sake of meeting this individual, the conversation would never tale my place, and my auto-suggestion would have been an endeavour resulting in an undiluted loss. Lastly, we can ready ourselves to deal with unexpected situations: In addition to dreaming up the means pursuant to the aforementioned specifications, we might be able to develop two additional directions, one in the event that something does not unfold itself according to expectations and the other when something pans out better than we anticipated. Exercise 47 – Alternative imaginations Create for yourselves an “as if” movie comprising an alternative to the previously identified means; thereafter, create for yourselves a second “as if” imagining that everything is going to turn out better than expected. Different ideals for each person, Objectives and the life plan A logical life plan must enable one to live every day in his life as if it were the last.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to take small voluntary efforts that can lead to meaningful conversations and experiences. Additionally, creating alternative imaginations and developing a logical life plan can help us prepare for unexpected situations and achieve our objectives. While not everyone may have a clear perception of their purpose, it's possible to formulate a program that's connected to one's self, and having an excellent friend can be a great ideal at any stage of life."
