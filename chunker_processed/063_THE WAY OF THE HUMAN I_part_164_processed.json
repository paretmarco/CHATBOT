  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text explains the principle of Differentiated Consciousness and the importance of making distinctions. The author offers an exercise to cultivate the second dimensional awareness of consciousness. The basic principle of Kashmir Shaivism, Jnanam Bandhah: \"Knowledge is bondage\" is also introduced. The text concludes with a discussion on the VOID of undifferentiated consciousness. The author discusses these concepts to help individuals understand themselves better and to have a clearer idea of what is happening around them.",
  "content": "Step II: Withdraw your attention from the thought or feeling prior to any knowledge or information about what the thought or feeling is. CULTIVATING THE SECOND DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS ASPECTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS2 Differentiated Consciousness involves the making of distinctions. It is that subtle something which makes distinctions.' It is that subtle something which makes distinctions.' For example, differentiated consciousness lets us know the difference between a table and a chair, your arm and my head. On a more subtle level, it lets us know the difference between a thought and a feeling, a sound and a vision, a memory and present time. Unfortunately, however, consciousness frequently muddles these distinctions, which causes chaos and confusion as to what is occurring in the present time, what occurred in the past of which we have a memory, and in an even more subtle way, which are \"my\" feelings and which are \"your\" feelings. Before we can appreciate the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, it might be helpful to distinguish the different aspects of consciousness and what they are. I discussed this approach in relation to trances in Trances People Live (1986) and The Dark Side of the Inner Child.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, cultivating differentiated consciousness involves making distinctions between different aspects of consciousness, including thoughts and feelings, sounds and visions, and memories and present time. To appreciate the void of undifferentiated consciousness, one must first understand the different dimensions of consciousness. Withdrawal of attention from thoughts or feelings before knowing them is a helpful step towards achieving this. Through this, we can tap into a state of consciousness that is voider than the void itself and has no separate \"I.\""
