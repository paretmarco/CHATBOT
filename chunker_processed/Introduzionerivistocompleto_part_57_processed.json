  "title": "Can Neuro-Linguistic Programming Help You Consciously Work on Yourself?",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on the various techniques used in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) for personal development, therapy, and business. Before diving into the techniques, the importance of relaxation techniques and a positive state of mind is highlighted. Anchoring is explained as a technique to intentionally or naturally connect an image or sound to our minds. The significance of our psychophysical condition and the power of our minds to reprogram negative learning are emphasized. The text mentions the use of instructive stories, anecdotes, and riddles to expand people's minds, as done by the renowned therapist Milton Erickson. The Symptom Prescription method, used by Erickson, is also discussed as a way to make small changes that lead to significant improvements.",
  "content": "The person can decide which behavior to modify, having at hand all the necessary tools with which to change. Although when necessary, especially at the beginning, this should be done with the help of the operator. Erickson, the best hypnotist of our times, never solved a problem in the traditional way. His way of applying therapy was astonishing. He used revolutionary techniques that were extremely efficient and he used different methods on different people, so that for a long time it was not possible to write anything about him or identify him with a particular type of therapy as had happened with other psychoanalysts. He agreed that he did not have a particular method; he compared himself to an artist and said, “When an artist paints he needs to be inspired. The same thing happens to me when I find myself faced with a problem. I decide in that moment what to do”. In each case the most important element in Erickson’s therapeutic practice was his use of instructive stories, anecdotes and riddles, for example, to overcome habitual limits, he used stories to expand peoples’ minds. THE BASIC METHOD USED BY Erickson in therapy was the “Symptom Prescription”, creating the way for small changes that were seen as the problem uptil that moment. It is something that prevents development, therefore, a behavior that springs up independently from will is prescribed at this point. Thus, the mind processes everything in a different way and the symptom or block goes away.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP offers a unique approach to therapy and self-improvement with its focus on practical tools and techniques to overcome challenges and achieve personal growth. Through the use of instructive stories, anecdotes, and the powerful \"Symptom Prescription\" method, NLP empowers individuals to consciously work on themselves and take control of their lives. By recognizing the importance of empathy and communication, NLP and INSTANT RAPPORT provide the most effective instruments for intervention on an individual and social level. Through NLP, individuals can choose to modify their behavior while respecting their unique individuality, unlocking the full potential of their mind and innate ability to control their own destiny."
