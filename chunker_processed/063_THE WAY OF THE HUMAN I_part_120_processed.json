  "title": "\"How can multi-dimensional awareness improve our perception of reality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The following text is about the development of multi-dimensional awareness and the external dimension of manifestation. Earlier, the text introduced Quantum Psychology, which focuses on developing awareness so that it is not limited by habitual fixations. The last 200 tokens explain how the external dimension of manifestation can limit our awareness of the present. The text describes how our tendency to generalize the present with the past can lead to losing our sense of present reality. The text also highlights a process called Associational Trance, which occurs when the nervous system assumes past and present are the same. The author emphasizes the importance of gaining choice over where we place our awareness to avoid being limited by the external dimension of manifestation.",
  "content": "To illustrate the difficulty of this, let's say I meet someone who reminds me of someone I once knew. \"I\" begin to relate to \"my\" internal memory and go \"self' to \"self,\" in the process losing my sense of present time reality. In other words, (as mentioned in Trances People Live), I go into a trance. I lose the external NOW and present time reality. This problem of going self to self can be seen when I say that \"you remind me of (fill in the blank)\" or \"this (situation, event, therapy, etc.,) is just like (fill in the blank).\" The tendency to imagine that the present time is the same as the past is a generalizing survival function of the nervous system, and in Quantum Psychology we call this process the Associational Trance. The Associational Trance occurs when the scanning and searching device of the nervous system generalizes automatically in order to maintain its survival by assuming that the past is exactly like the present. \"You\" are no longer able to see differences between people, situations, or events.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Associational Trance is a survival function of our nervous system that can hinder our ability to experience and respond to present time reality. Being aware of this tendency to generalize from past experiences can help us recognize and overcome the Associational Trance, enabling us to develop a more multi-dimensional awareness and fully engage with the world around us."
