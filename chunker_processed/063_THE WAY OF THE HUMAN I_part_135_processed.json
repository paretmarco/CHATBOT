  "title": "\"What is the Thinking Dimension and how does it affect our interpretation of reality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of understanding the second dimension of manifestation, which involves our thoughts, fantasies, beliefs, and perceptions. In order to deepen our awareness of this dimension, we must focus internally and learn how our internal world creates our subjective experience of external reality. The author references Nisargadatta Maharaj, who emphasizes the importance of knowing the inner world through meditation. The text concludes with a conversation in which the author advises against trying to figure out the meaning of life, and instead allowing the mind to seek it out while we witness. The text highlights the point that what is true at the Thinking Dimension may not hold true at any other dimension.",
  "content": "It involves not only our thoughts and images but also fantasies, values, beliefs, concepts, ideas and perceptions. In order to understand this dimension, it is necessary to deepen \"our\" internal focus and develop our awareness of what is happening inside our psyche. Otherwise we will never see present time, never experience people or situations or objects in the here-and-now. Thoughts and images do not create external reality, a point often misunderstood. However, they do create our interpretation and our internal subjective experience of our external reality, if we believe them. And hence our subjective experience of the internal gets projected onto the external. For example, if I change my thought called \"You do not like me\" to \"You like me,\" \"I\" internally might have the experience of, \"You like me\" but whether you like me or not might not be affected. Why is it important to know how the internal thinking world works? Nisargadatta Maharaj was once asked, \"Why should we meditate (enquirer\" He replied, Of the outer world, we know a lot. Of the inner world, we know very little.",
  "last_phrase": "To truly experience the present moment and interact with the world around us, we must understand the complexity of our internal thinking world. Our thoughts and beliefs create our subjective experience of reality, but they don't necessarily reflect external reality. By meditating and deepening our self-awareness, we can free ourselves from unknown material in our consciousness, and develop a multi-dimensional awareness that helps us navigate both our internal and external worlds with greater clarity and freedom."
