  "title": "What are the tendencies of the void in quantum psychology and how do they shape the \"I\" structure?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the concept of \"NOT-I-I\" and pure awareness. The last 200 tokens dive deeper into the tendencies of the Void and how it affects the mind's organization. The author explains that the contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS creates major constructs that solidify the mind, namely time and future. However, in the NOT-I-I, there is neither past, present nor future. The last part of the text delves into the \"I\" structures and how the belief of needing a reason to do, be, have or create perpetuates and justifies the structure of the \"I.\"",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Being here now is not being in time, or location. The now is not in time, it is in NO-TIME-NOW. \"I\" STRUCTURES The next VOID tendency is the belief that you have to have a reason to do, be, have or create. In the \"NOT-I-I\" there is neither reason nor purpose. The nervous system has an automatic part of the new brain which creates reasons and stories to justify experiences. Reasons, justifications and purposes only perpetuate and justify the structure of the \"I.\" Much of the \"I's\" self-talk is about having reasons, imagining you should have reasons, and imagining reasonable \"answers\" to questions another might ask you. This occurs in childhood because parents insist on reasons. Reasons are like a virus that infects us all, eating away much of our awareness. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The External dimension, Thinking dimension, Emotional di- mension and Biological dimension, are all a unit which arise 153 Wolinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Woiinsky: Michael: Wolinsky : Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: Michael: Woiinsky: Michael: Wolinsky: ________________ That's an interesting idea.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing the principles of quantum psychology can help us break free from the limiting beliefs and structures of the \"I,\" including the need for reasons and justifications. By living in the no-time-now, we can fully integrate the external, thinking, emotional, and biological dimensions of our being into a unified whole, and let the energy of life move us towards greater awareness and fulfillment."
