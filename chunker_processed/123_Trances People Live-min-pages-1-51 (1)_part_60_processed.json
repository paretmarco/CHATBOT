  "title": "What is the paradoxical nature of therapeutic trance according to Gilligan and Erickson?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous tokens, passages by Gilligan on the hypnotic state and trance were examined, with an emphasis on the latter's ability to allow individuals to detach from certain attachments and return to a basic sense of identity. This last part of the text delves into the paradoxical nature of therapeutic trance, with a focus on Erickson's \"no-trance\" state, which allows patients to enter a more natural and relaxed state of mind. The text discusses the implications of worsening a patient's symptomatology in order to demonstrate their ability to change it, and how this approach relates to state-dependent theory in hypnosis.",
  "content": "i.ations come and go in a state of de relaxation and comfort.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, paradoxical interventions and the state-dependent theory provide valuable insight into effective therapeutic methods for treating symptomatic states. By intensifying the experience of narrowed focus, therapists can lead patients into a state of relaxation and comfort, ultimately leading to deep and lasting change. Using the symptom itself as a tool for creating a more therapeutic natural state is a powerful approach that can help patients overcome a wide range of issues."
