  "title": "How can we break free from our programmed responses and face the concept of death?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the conversation continues between Barbara and Wolinsky. They discuss the experience of losing someone suddenly and the shock that comes with it. They emphasize the importance of acknowledging and going through the feeling of loss to feel better. The concept of death and finality is separated, and the experience of nothingness is explored. The text explores the idea of questioning our programmed responses and finding a deeper understanding of ourselves.",
  "content": "Barbara:Shock that just like that, she's gone. Wolinsky:Create that. Probably just about everybody. Give me an example. I think I do it with Bob (her husband). Chapter I Create the idea that there must be a feeling there that I'm resisting. Then create the idea that you have to go through that to find out what that is, then you will feel better. Oh yeah, it takes up an inordinate time and energy and consciousness, or lack of it. It has to do with, you don't exist. If you didn't exist, you don't have to do all of this. Create the idea that there is a feeling there, you must be resisting it so you don't have to experience nonexistence. Okay. If you separate the concept of final from the concept of death, they are separate concepts, what's the experience like? There's nothing. There's just death. The body stopped. There's nothing. Death, the body stopped, there's nothing. There are no words. So if you separate death and final, they are separate concepts, what doesn't get created? Nothing comes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to acknowledge the concept of final and death as separate entities. By accepting the notion of nothingness and resistance, one can eliminate the fear of nonexistence and experience a freeing sensation. By being aware of the size and shape of the idea called final, we can let go of our attachments to life and embrace the unknown."
