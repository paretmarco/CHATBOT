  "first_phrase": "This text is the final part of a larger piece that discusses how to create a life plan by accessing one's intuition and understanding time. In the previous part, the author explains how predetermination and free human choice can work synergistically, and how focusing one's energies is the first foundational layer for the creative process. This last section explains that the life plan itself must come from one's essential being and cannot be a \"cut and paste\" plan. It is refined through the frames of the self, which analyze the dimensions of our being such as health, success, relations, and culture. These frames act as a vehicle for understanding our ideas, affections, and actions.",
  "content": "Said differently, you will live in two times simultaneously: A projected time (chronos) and a real time (kairòs). Understanding time and its two dimensions: planning and opportunities The plan itself must be borne out of our most intimate essential being. As it happens to every architect, our plan — meaning our life plan — is already in us, as a living kernel, even before we have decided to jot it down on paper. Precisely for that reason, it never consists in a \"cut and paste” plan. Fixed and immutable recipes cannot work. Each one of us has a set of aspirations differing from those of his neighbour, as well as a different life: It is precisely such aspirations, such predilections, which form the guidelines of our LIFE PLAN. This plan shall be studied and refined through the help of the FRAMES OF THE SELF which analyze the dimensions of our being. LIFE PLAN Frames of the SELF: Health Success Relations Culture Etc. These frames of the self are nothing other than a thread, as complete as it can possibly be, which is bound to act as a vehicle for us to understand our ideas, affections and actions.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, creating a life plan based on our unique aspirations and refining it through analyzing the dimensions of our being can lead to a fulfilling and harmonious existence. Incorporating Frames of the Self, such as Health, Success, Relations, Culture, etc., can act as a vehicle for understanding our ideas, affections, and actions. Having an ideal direction that acts as a fulcrum for our actions is crucial to reaching our desired destination."
