  "title": "What is the False Core in Quantum Psychology and How Does it Affect Your Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is an excerpt from Trances People Live, focusing on Quantum Psychology principles related to the False Core and the Observer effect. The author emphasizes that the False Core is the organizing principle that shapes our entire psychology, and to access the ESSENCE, I AM, and VOID, the False Core must be dissolved. To trace the False Core, the author suggests asking oneself, \"What is the worst of that or what about that is so bad?\" The text highlights the importance of the Observer effect in Quantum Psychology and explains how the observer is inseparable from the observed. Ultimately, the author suggests that to go beyond the observer-False Core-False Self complex, one must enter into ESSENCE-I AM and the NOT-I-I.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: There is not one observer but an infinite number of them. With each experience a different observer-experiencer-experience arises and subsides. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: As in Quantum Physics so in Quantum Psychology, you cannot separate the observer from the observed or the knower from the known. The observer or knower is part of the observed or known experience; each is inseparable from the other. 39 The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THE OBSERVER IS PART OF THE OBSERVED A pivotal part of Werner Heisenberg's theory of Quantum Physics is the fact that the observer cannot be separated from the thing being observed. In the beginning phases, it is important to develop and observe, to realize that you are the looker and not what you are looking at, and that anything you can observe, you cannot be. Next, \"you\" see that the observer of the False Core Driver and the False Self Compensator itself are really one solid unit. In other words, the observer is part of that which it observes. Ultimately, you go beyond the observer-False Core-False Self complex and enter into ESSENCE-I AM and the NOT-I-I.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the principles of quantum psychology remind us that the observer cannot be separated from the observed, and that the observer is part of the experience that is taking place. By developing multi-dimensional awareness and recognizing the interconnected nature of all things, we can move beyond the limitations of the ego and access a state of pure awareness, witnessing the observer-observed dyad and ultimately transcending it."
