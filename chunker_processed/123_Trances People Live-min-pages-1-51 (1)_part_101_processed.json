  "title": "\"How can a therapist move beyond rigid role definitions for personal growth and better help their clients?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text explore the idea of \"moving beyond an identity as 'therapist'\" and emphasizes the importance of a therapist's own growth in addition to their clients'. The author argues that therapists should acknowledge their own feelings and perceptions, rather than conforming to rigid role definitions. They mention the concept of \"co-transference\" introduced by Carl Whitaker, which emphasizes the idea that everyone is trying to grow and learn from each other, including therapists and clients. The author concludes with the idea that there is no difference between the therapist and the client, except for the fact that the therapist gets paid.",
  "content": "Pioneer family therapist Carl Whitaker (1989; Whitaker & alone,1987) first attempted to dispel this polarity by introducing Mtheconcept of \"co-transference\" (as opposed to the traditional dyad, transfcrenceicountertransfcrence). His message was, We're all in this together, we all project on each other, we all try to hide, we all try to manipulate, we arc all trying to grow. Now in his mid- seventies, Whitaker uses his lecturing circuit to \"go crazy as the patient\" for the audience, Whitaker's best times occur when he fully allows himself to \"share his own craziness.\" Perhaps the most profound way fora person earning a living as a therapist to expand his or her inner context is to integrate and own the understanding that there is no difference between the therapist and the client. Ina training group in which I was discussing this idea I was asked,\"Then, how do you know who's the therapist and who's the client?\" My answer: \"The person who gets paid is the therapist.\" That drew laughs, but I really did not intend it to be a humorous communication. On the contrary, 1 was quite serious.",
  "last_phrase": "To fully embrace the concept of \"co-transference\" and expand your inner context as a therapist, it's vital to acknowledge that there is no difference between therapist and client. Don't fall into the trap of fitting clients into preconceived models or roles. Embrace the shared growth and be willing to challenge and be challenged."
