  "title": "How can language and hypnosis be used to influence others and how does self-presencing play a role in the success of a trader?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the concept of hypnosis was explored, highlighting the various ways in which individuals can be induced into a trance. This last part focuses on the figure of the Trader in the context of online trading platforms. It emphasizes the importance of self-control, self-discipline, and a deep understanding of market psychology for those who seek to make a profit in trading. The section discusses the irrationality of the markets and how they are influenced by the attitudes of millions of people. In other words, success in trading requires more than mere access to markets; it involves mastering the art of self-control and understanding market psychology.",
  "content": "This book plays the role of an aid enabling you to become aware of those tools, and to learn how to practically turn hypnosis to your advantage rather than allowing the opposite to take place. The Trader The figure of the trader has developed owing to the emergence of Internet and online trading platforms. The ease with which, nowadays, one can access markets and invest his own money at once in whatever he might desire has caused and is still causing many rich people to hope to earn large sums quickly, while remaining comfortably seated in front of their personal computers. This is no doubt possible, and yet the keys to be able to remain operative in the markets are located first and foremost inside our own selves: In the control over oneâ€™s mind, in self-discipline, and in the percipient understanding of a series of elements produced by the sum-total of psychological attitudes from millions of people. The markets, in fact, are not fully rational, given that their behaviour is conditioned on the interlaced effect of so many individual psychologies. Therefore, a person who decides to invest money in trading without having a profound working knowledge of the laws governing the markets will have extremely thin chances of succeeding.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you're considering trading, remember that success lies in your mind, not just in the market. This book can be a great aid in helping you develop self-awareness and the ability to master your own psychology, which is essential for turning hypnosis to your advantage and demystifying the markets."
