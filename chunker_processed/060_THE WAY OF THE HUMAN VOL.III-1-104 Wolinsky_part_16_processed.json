  "title": "\"What is the Essential Dimension Exercise and how can you experience your False Core and Essence?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this exercise, participants are guided to explore their False Core and understand the associations connected to it before shifting their attention to their Essential Core. The Essential Dimension exercise is a part of the teachings of the Diamond Approach by Hameed Ali. The last 200 tokens describe the final step where the False Core is asked about its ultimate desire and participants are encouraged to experience it through their Essence. This is meant to show them that what they were seeking in their False Core is actually present within themselves.",
  "content": "Step 8:Ask your False Core (and allow it to answer), \"What is it that you are seeking more then anything else in the 8 Chapter 1 world.\" (Now, you may not get a quick response but I want you to stay with it for a little while. Get a sense of what your False Core is really seeking.) When you get a sense of what that False Core is seeking more than anything else in the world, experience that quality of ESSENCE. For example, if your False Core is seeking peace, experience the peace. )` Notice what, if anything, happens to your False Core as you go into this essential experience. From inside your ESSENCE, notice the size and shape of your False Core, as well as the BIG EMPTINESS the False Core is floating in. From inside your ESSENCE, notice the intensity of the False Core and the associational chains that it contains. Have the False Core and its associations turn around so that they can know that what they were seeking is in ESSENCE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the Essential Dimension Exercise #2 and experiencing the spaciousness inside your physical body, you'll be able to notice what your False Core is seeking and to feel the essential quality of it, which will help you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotions in different situations."
