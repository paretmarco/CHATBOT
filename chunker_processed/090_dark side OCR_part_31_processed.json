  "title": "\"What is the Dark Side of the Inner Child? Understanding the Role of the Creator and Observer in Healing\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking article, the author emphasizes the need to dismantle the old-world view of the wounded inner child. The article explores the quantum understanding of the self and how it relates to the creation and maintenance of the wounded inner child identity. The author highlights three important points and argues that true healing can only happen when one realizes that they are the source of their identity. The last 200 tokens touch on the importance of understanding the dark side of the inner child identity and how it can be leveraged towards true healing. The author shares insights from an Indian teacher and invites readers to empower themselves as the observer, rather than the inner child.",
  "content": "It is 16 + The Dark Side of the Inner Child time to take the next step and dismantle this old world view. Last month, I was invited to give a presentation to a group of about forty psychotherapists on the East Coast. I asked the group, \"Have any of you healed, or know anyone who has healed the wounded inner child?\" There was no response. What we must find out is who is observing this inner child. In this way you the observer is empowered rather than the inner child. I said to the group, \"Once you create a wounded child identity and decide to heal it by creating some other identity to say the right things to, combat it, re-assure it or champion it, you (the observer/ creator) must always keep the wounded inner child identity in your psyche so that you know what it is that needs to be healed. In order to take the next step and go beyond the inner child you must know its' dark side. My Indian teacher, Nisargadatta Maharaj, would say, \"First, you must know what something is in order to give it up.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial to understand and dismantle the old world view of the inner child, both its light and dark sides, in order to empower ourselves as observers rather than let the wounded inner child identity rule our psyche. By recognizing the dark aspects of the inner child, we can work towards healing and moving beyond it, creating healthier relationships and a more fulfilling life."
