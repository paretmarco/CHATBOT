  "title": "What is the Quantum Psychology Principle and how does it relate to dissociation and survival trances?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of observer-identities and trance states in the context of Quantum Psychology. It explains how dissociative observers can lead to personal grandiosity and a loss of humanness and connection to humanity. The article also discusses the formation of observer-identities as a survival mechanism to resist trauma, such as being punished for being wrong. The last 200 tokens delve into how children may absorb their parents' identities as a survival trance. It includes the example of people growing up to vow not to be like their parents.",
  "content": "Survival trances come in many different forms. For example, when you are growing up, if your parents say you're wrong and they're right, then being wrong is something that is bad and generally a child 213 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is punished for it. A child may be punished by being spanked or sent to their room (which is labeled as a devastating experience, something to avoid at all costs). It's like a mini-death, which becomes fused with the idea of being wrong, and must be avoided in order to survive. This is part of the trance process. Children fixate on this mini-death of being wrong, and thus fuse together the idea that being wrong = punishment = death. Being wrong becomes a trauma. Thus, to resist the trauma, an observer and an identity are formed to defend against the experience of that mini- death. Another survival trance occurs when the child fuses with and becomes the parent, and takes on the parent's identity. For example, many people vow when they grow up they will never be like mom or dad.",

By recognizing the trauma and creating a new identity and observer, we can move past the limitations that have been holding us back and create a brighter future for ourselves."
