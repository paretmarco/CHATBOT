  "title": "How Does Tranceference Impact Our Present Relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, we delve into the concept of transference, the projection of past feelings and attitudes onto present situations. The implications of transference are explored in relation to collapsing levels of consciousness, including age regression and a disconnection from present-time reality. With reference to the works of Marshall and Marshall and Ichazo's Fourteen Pillars of the Perfect Recognition, this section illuminates the ways in which our past experiences continue to influence our present perceptions and behaviors.",
  "content": "Quantum Psychology sees seven major effects of collapsing of the levels which help to create trance-ference. First, the trance of trance-ference requires that the individual age-regress, acting younger than they are. For example, recall a time in your relationships when you felt powerless, helpless or trapped. These are all red flags that you are age-regressing and collapsing the levels. Second, the individual who is age-regressing will generally not be aware of what is occurring. For example, recall a time you felt powerless or trapped in a relationship and you could not find your way out of the situation. Unfortunately, more often than not, we remain unaware of our age-regressions while they are occurring, not realizing that we are collapsing the levels. Third, the individual who is age-regressing is not in present time, but rather moves from a present-time experience of self-to- 209 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness other, to a past-time experience of self-to-other. For example, recall a time in your relationship when you felt angry that your partner was not available to fill your needs, or where you expected your partner to want to do what you wanted to do and then felt angry when they did not.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, collapsing the levels is a common phenomenon that occurs when an individual age-regresses, moves away from the present-time experience, and re-enacts past-time experiences. Unfortunately, we often remain unaware of our collapse, and as a result, we treat the present-time other as a past-time other, which can lead to relationship problems. Recognizing this trance-ference can help us break free from age-regression and develop a healthier understanding of our relationships."
