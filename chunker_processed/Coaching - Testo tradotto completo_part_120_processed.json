  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the key to achieving self-mastery and power over different situations lies in being conscious of one's own being. One essential step towards this is to remove useless thoughts and to acquire consciousness of the self by pronouncing the words \"I am\". By detaching the self from ideas that are not truly belonging to it, one can create a state of mind that enables them to choose and act towards specific purposes. Thus, one's authentic reality comes before any label they might add to \"I am\".",
  "content": "This is an existential itinerary which can only derive from an inward choice, and from an urge which the person concerned feels inside him. Therefore, the essential aspect in respect of every one of us is to reach the point at which he is able to create within himself a state enabling him to choose, to decide, to act with a view to attaining his specific purposes. Exercise 28: I am Let us simply try and acquire consciousness of our being. Let us pronounce inside us the words \"I am\". Which is the sensation that is thereby engendered in your body? Accepting the \"I am\" by detaching it from all the ideas that are linked to it and which do not belong to it, is the foundation for developing any capacity. Sometimes we say, ‘I am a doctor’, ‘I am a student’, and so on. However, our authentic reality comes before any term which we might suffix to the verb “I am”. If we realize that, we will likewise realize that all possibilities lie in front of us and are simply choices to be made.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving self-awareness and self-presencing is not only a philosophical concept, but a practical reality that can be attained through conscious efforts. By detaching ourselves from the labels society imposes on us and becoming present to our authentic selves, we can make conscious choices to attain our specific purposes and transcend beyond the limitations of mere linguistic identification. Let us take the necessary steps towards this inward journey to truly experience the vast possibilities of our existence."
