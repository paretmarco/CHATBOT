  "title": "\"How can one develop a powerful presence through exercises like walking and enumeration?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses a technique that allows practitioners to have a deeper sense of awareness and presence in their daily lives. The author explains that by reaching this level of consciousness, individuals become powerful and can better understand their relationships with others. The last 200 tokens provide two exercises that can be used to develop this level of presence: The March and The Enumeration. The March exercise involves walking without mentally guiding one's march, while The Enumeration exercise requires the individual to enumerate whatever action they are currently performing. The author notes that these exercises should be approached in the initial stages to increase consciousness and perception, but encourages stopping talking while acting to avoid materializing thoughts.",
  "content": "We can observe how this exercise encompasses two levels of coenesthetic perception 105: The first one, comprising sensations, is pure, whereas the second one is located in the body which manages to find its balance and true position. Finally, this kind of presence might become connected to energy sensations. Exercise 54 – The enumeration Another interesting exercise consists in enumerating whatever one is doing 106. For example: I am turning the steering wheel to the right, I am pressing on the accelerator, etc. This exercise must be embarked upon at the initial stage, so as to augment one’s consciousness, not only the perceptive one but even the consciousness of what one is busy doing. After such initial stage, one should of course stop talking while he acts. We must of course take care not to confuse this exercise with a form of materialization. We are in fact dealing here with primary descriptions rather than with reflections, with concrete facts 107.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises like enumeration can enhance one's consciousness and help maintain mental control in various situations, preventing the mind from wandering and the attention from jumping. These exercises add a new level to the usual exercises centered on presence, making one more present and less likely to lose focus during business negotiations or communication. It is important not to confuse these exercises with materialization but to see them as concrete facts that lead to true presence and awareness."
