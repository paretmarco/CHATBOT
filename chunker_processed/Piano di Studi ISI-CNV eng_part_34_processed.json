  "title": "How can you use hypno-selling and non-verbal communication to enhance your effectiveness and charisma?",
  "first_phrase": "In this course, participants learn how to enhance their effectiveness and charisma by using gaze and nonverbal communication. Additionally, they will work with the \"hypno-selling\" system, a method that combines NLP-3 and other elements to increase persuasion skills. The two-day program covers topics such as the Enneagram, nonverbal commands, magnetism, and relationships. The last 200 tokens of the text focus on real hypno-mentalism and hypno-magnetism, where people can alter the reality of others with nonverbal communication. The course offers international certifications for professional coaching, NLP-3, and quantum coaching. Its innovative approach includes quantum mechanics, which enables the creation of models and predictions for controllable quantum behavior.",
  "content": "I wrote down, “La jambe gauche.” He then, standing about two yards from the girl, made an effort of will, after which he told the girl to move about: upon which she moved every limb except her left leg, which had become perfectly rigid. In the same way the girl’s right leg, and then one of her arms, were paralyzed. But the most curious thing was when I desired that the girl’s head might become motionless. It was literally stuck to the wall by the silent will of the Mesmeriser. Her arms, her legs could move, but not her head; so that she could only walk forward as far as the attachment by her head would permit. On forcibly separating her head from the wall, it went back with a stiffness which seemed to me inimitable by voluntary muscular action.” In our courses we explain these feats. In the future we will even activate a complete course of study in these phenomena. Actually some of these teaching are in the course “train the trainers” It is a discipline that creates effects that are impressive many times not only for the subject but even for the experimenter. In real hypno-mentalism we can have contact mind reading, thelepatic effects based on the “psychic atmosphere” we create with the subject, reading people based on physiognomy and other elements, and having the subject reacting hypnotically to the non verbal orders of the operator. The subject has always the eyes open and no trance or post hypnotic suggestion is used.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, real Hypno-mentalism and Hypno-magnetism are powerful techniques that can be used to better understand people, communicate with the unconscious mind, and improve intuition and creativity. These techniques can be combined to create even more striking effects and must be practiced in a participative and realistic way. The Hermetic Magnetism course offered by the school can help awaken the magnetic force within us and increase our ability to communicate at multiple levels. The school also offers continuing education and certification for those interested in becoming professionals in these fields."
