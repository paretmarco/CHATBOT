  "title": "\"How Can One Turn an Ideal into Reality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the article emphasizes the importance of defining an ideal in order to channel one's mental energy towards achieving it. It introduces two minds that exist within a person- the limited, programmed ego and the vaster, essential inward being- and suggests using the latter to define one's goals in relation to the universe. The article also highlights the significance of concrete and feasible action to turn ideals into reality. The concepts of results, ideal, vitality, essential, and individualized being are touched upon.",
  "content": "Likewise, willing is the consequential confluence of two underlying elements: Possessing a valid ideal, and a sufficient reserve of mental energy. We truly want something when we have the ability to canalize our energy towards an ideal. But in which manner are we going to define an ideal? There are two minds operating within man. Some label them the conscious and the unconscious. We prefer to define them as follows: 1. A limited ego (the \"I\" that is replete with mental chattering), which is also a programmed ego – the automatic mental pilot –, i.e. the totality of habits, the ostensible logic which makes up our daily being and which engrosses most of our time; 2. A vaster mind, the essential inward being we get access to when we are being creative. We should use this larger mind as the departure point so as to define our ideals, our ultimate goals, in relation to the Universe.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve our ideals and direct our energy towards them, we need to transcend our limited ego and tap into our essential being's vaster mind. By doing so, we can overcome our fears and access a broader level, where we can find the source of all our energies. To achieve this, we must shelve aside any useless things and focus on pursuing our earnest goals in life."
