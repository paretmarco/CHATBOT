  "title": "What are the Three Gates to Higher Consciousness and How Can We Access Them?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, we discussed the three gates of the temple of Solomon and the Graal. The Graal was symbolized by the head of the Stag, and when we change our level of consciousness, we may feel a tempest in our being, created by our illusory attachments. This prevents us from accessing the enlightenment that is in front of us. In this concluding part, we will discuss two bridges towards the \"not-I\" and the ninth castle. We will also explore the crystal palace, which is a connection between the pineal gland and the pituitary gland in the eastern traditions.",
  "content": "In some way is a moment where you can have a “passage” at another level May be the first time you do these meditations you will just feel it But progressively an opening will be there The Glass Bridge You are going on a glass bridge It is a strange bridge Immediately after you having passed the bridge breaks down in thousands of pieces But is only an illusion In reality if you have courage you can go through the bridge But if you have fear, you will never go through it. This bridge is letting go all of our former reality Let your ideas thinking memories going away as bubbles Stay before your memories, associations At the end only the I The Rotating bridge Perceval continues his magical path He meets Briol and the White castle The white is the spirituality and the transcendence But after the white castle we have the rotating bridge. The rotating bridge means a change in consciousness. We are on another level. The Rotating bridge brings back energy to ourself and we prepare for the Tournament. In some way energy comes back to the body. We learn to be at two levels at the same time. We touch the infinite and after we connect again to the here and now in the reality Go back on lesson 1 and practice again PRESENCE the whole week Be aware of yourself, of your body IN EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY We will continue on the next lesson ! Be PREUX! Neurophysiology The crystal Palace is the name given in the eastern traditions to the connection between pineal gland and pituitary gland.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the journey towards transcendence and self-discovery involves traversing bridges of fear and illusion. The Crystal Palace, the connection between the pineal and pituitary gland, is activated during the journey, allowing for transcendental vision and a heightened sense of awareness. Practice presence in every moment to prepare for the transformative experience ahead. Remember, with courage and openness, you can cross the glass bridge and rotate the bridge, transcending former realities and connecting with the infinite."
