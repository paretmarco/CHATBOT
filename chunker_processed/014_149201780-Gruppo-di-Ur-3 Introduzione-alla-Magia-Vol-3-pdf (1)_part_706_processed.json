  "title": "Is Jung's interpretation of psychology a distortion and degradation of scientific theory?",
  "first_phrase": "This passage is a critique of Carl Jung's interpretation of psychoanalytic theory. The author asserts that Jung's work is a distortion and a degradation of the theory's principles. The text describes Jung's association with the mythologist Kerényi and his interpretations of classic myths. Additionally, the text discusses Jung's works on alchemy and Paracelsian theories as well as his own psychoanalytic theory. Finally, the text explores the idea of the unconscious mind and its relation to consciousness. The last 200 tokens focus on the concept of the collective unconscious as an autonomous entity that transcends the individual. It argues that Jung believed the unconscious cannot be fully understood or resolved in the conscious mind.",
  "content": "Questo inconscio assume i tratti di un ente autonomo a carattere collettivo (), che trascende l'individuo: è una totalità, di cui la persona cosciente non è che una se- zione arbitraria. Da un lato, di tale inconscio si afferma l'impenetrabilità (\").",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Jung's concept of the collective unconscious may take on mystical and irrational aspects, but at its core, it represents the primal and ancestral foundations of the human being. Despite its ties to biology and materiality, the collective unconscious remains impenetrable to conscious attention and serves as a necessary reminder of the limits of our subjective experience."
