  "title": "What is NLP and how does it work to improve our lives?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the three main components of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and how they impact our perception and processing of the world. It then delves into how NLP can help individuals organize their thoughts, improve their strategies, and transform their lives. The last part of the text focuses on various NLP techniques and how they can be applied in different areas of life, including anchoring, metaphors, and phobia techniques. The author also emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, communication, and positive thinking in achieving success. This guide has been created by students of the ISI-CNV institute and serves as an introduction to the subject matter taught during the “basic practitioner” course.",
  "content": "Following this internal effort, each one of us responds to stimuli with his/ her own language which can be of two types: verbal and non-verbal. Non-verbal language which is immediate, unconscious, automatic and symbolic is very important, and it often represents a way of achieving effective and real communications. “The secret to having a successful life is inside of you!” ATTITUDES TO INTEREST US IN NLP When we approach NLP, we need to be pushed by a strong desire to participate in life and a curiosity towards exploring what is new, wishing to challenge ourselves in something unexplored in order to achieve and live our dreams. How many of you have projects that are blocked by fear of failure, thinking of all the difficulties you might meet? This behavior runs the risks of becoming counterproductive.......We are the first difficulty that we need to overcome. You yourself need to focus on the results that you want to achieve and, moreover, dedicate all the energy you can give to your projects. Many people think that NLP is simply a group of techniques; instead, it is the study and modeling of success strategies, animated by the winning positive thought of those that have achieved great goals in all aspects of their life. WE ARE GREATER THAN WHAT WE THINK WE ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! An example of this greatness was the American psychiatrist Milton Erickson who, notwithstanding his handicap, managed to develop the small amount of sensibility he had in order to be able to have better contact with others.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP is not just a set of techniques but also an attitude towards positive living. It is an effective means of transforming difficulties into opportunities for progression and helps us to concentrate on our objectives and achieve them. Instant rapport is an important technique in building and maintaining good interpersonal relations with trust and agreement. Non-verbal communication is another fundamental language that allows us to relate to others and express our deepest emotions. By understanding and utilizing these techniques, we can improve both our personal and professional relationships and achieve success in all aspects of our lives."
