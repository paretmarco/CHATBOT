  "content": "When people asked her a question, she always said \"The body thinks or the mind thinks,\" rather than \"I think.\" The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness THINKING DIMENSION EXERCISE #4 Focus: Each time a thought arises ask, \"Where does that thought subside to?\" This teaching is from Ramana Maharshi, the 20th century sage and teacher of self-enquiry. A thought arises and subsides: notice where that thought subsides. Is there is an answer to this question? NO. We're noticing the space. Once you're in that space, there won't be anything. There will be nothing. Then another thought will arise called, \"I don't know if I got it or not.\" Notice where that thought subsides to. A student asked for a comment on images coming in because he found them to be the only thing that he was aware of He thought perhaps he should be analyzing the images. Ramana Maharishi used to say, \"When you're cleaning your house, you do not need to analyze the dirt.\" I told this student to slow the process down so that each image was like a movie frame.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this exercise of multi-dimensional awareness by Ramana Maharshi encourages us to detach from our thoughts and become aware of the spaces between them. By practicing this exercise, we develop the ability to witness our thoughts instead of analyzing them, ultimately becoming more present in the moment and finding peace in the spaces between our thoughts."
