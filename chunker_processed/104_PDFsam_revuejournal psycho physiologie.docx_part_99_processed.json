  "title": "What are the notable deaths in France in 1888, including a journalist and two famous graphologists?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the lack of imagination exhibited in certain experiments. Moving on, the piece announces the death of Louis Simonin, an esteemed journalist whose biography is yet unknown, but who was known for his elevated thought on science and economics. The author also notes Simonin's connection to magnetism. The text goes on to mention the recent deaths of two famous graphologists, M. Desbarolles and M. Adrien Varinard, giving a short tribute to each.",
  "content": "Ce dernier était le continuateur de l’abbé M icbon, le créateur de la graphologie. Dans son journal, La Graphologie, qui en était à sa quinzième année, il dépensait une somme de talent vraiment considérable. Alexandre Dumas a prononcé un beau et profond discours sur la tombe de Desbarolles. Nous en reparlerons. M. Varinard est mort le 27 mai.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the passing of Claude-Marie-François-Adrien Varinard des Cotes, a prominent figure in the field of graphology and a respected member of various scientific societies, is mourned deeply by his family and colleagues. May he rest in peace."
