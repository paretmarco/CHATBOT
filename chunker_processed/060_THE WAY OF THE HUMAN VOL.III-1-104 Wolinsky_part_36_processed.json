  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text discusses the concept of ESSENCE and its relationship with the heart. The author emphasizes that ESSENCE is a being-to-being or ESSENCE-to-ESSENCE connection that is beyond personality and can happen at any moment. Additionally, the text includes a meditation exercise focused on visualizing the physical heart of an enlightened being inside one's body. By doing so, one can tap into the energy of this being and experience a deeper sense of intimacy. The text doesn't mention any specific names or concepts apart from ESSENCE, and the meditation exercise is suggested to be performed individually or in a group.",
  "content": "ESSENCE has that as one of its most tender \"interpersonal\" ESSENCE-to-ESSENCE experiences. It is beyond personality and can happen at any moment. I know for myself that it is always there. What makes it exceptionally wonderful is when another (ESSENCE) is available and answers back. In other words they are in ESSENCE and you are in ESSENCE. This greatly magnifies the experience and makes ESSENCE a place for real intimacy-beyond the persona. Practice: This meditation can be done in a group as well as. Let your eyes close. Very gently focus your attention on your physical heart. Feel your heart beating, feel it and see it, get a good deep sense of the beating of your physical heart, and listen or feel or see your physical heart beating. Keep your attention on your physical heart, feeling or hearing or seeing it pumping. Imagine that inside your chest is the physical heart of an enlightened being. That her or his physical heart is beating inside your body. Feel his or her heart pumping, hear it pumping. Feel the beating inside your body, feel the blood rushing through your veins. Feel all the energy of this being's heart inside your body.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the essence meditation exercise into your daily routine can lead to genuine intimacy and deeper connections beyond one's persona. Practicing this with a partner or a group elevates the experience even more as you focus on the physical heart beating inside an enlightened being. Try it out, and you might find it brings a new dimension to your interpersonal relationships."
