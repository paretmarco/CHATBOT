  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section of Chapter VIII, Wolinsky leads a therapeutic session in exploring the relationship between external environment and the False Core. The conversation revolves around a client, Denise's experience of losing control in the face of someone's manic behavior. Denise describes feeling an energy rising from her thighs to her head and how she clamped down in response. The conversation highlights Wilhelm Reich's principle that repressed animal energy moves upward into thoughts, triggering a psychological and energetic process.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:(To group) So we are going to look at it in terms of an energetic process as well as a psychological process. (To client) So this no control thing, I want to call it almost like a roaring, energyâ€”it's an energy moving underneath. Denise:Something coming at me or coming up in me, ris- ing. Yes, I know that one. Wolinsky:Where do you feel that? Denise:I would have to back up before my tightening. I feel it in my thighs. I feel it in my legs. Wolinsky:Take a look and see how far up. Denise:There's two levels. First, there is like a front first. It's in the inner thighs like a wash of energy coming up and then afterwards it's like there is a following, something on the backside of the calves. Like a little gentle, pulling, tugging thing. 172 Wolinsky:What did you create in response to his manic re- sponse to you? Denise:I clamped down' and got cooler instantly. I could feel the energy in me but what I do with it was, phew.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, when facing intense emotional responses, it's important to recognize the energetic and psychological components involved. Pay attention to where you feel the energy in your body, and instead of clamping down or suppressing it, try to explore it and find healthy ways to respond to it. Don't forget to trace the event to avoid falling into the False Core Conclusion-False Self Solution cycle."
