  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the benefits of relaxation on both the body and mind. It cites the works of Prof. Clifford Saron, who noticed improvements in concentration, anxiety, and emotional awareness among those who practiced relaxation mentally. It also references Prof. Benson's book, \"The Relaxation Response,\" which suggests that daily relaxation can reduce psychosomatic diseases. The last 200 tokens focus on the concept of physical and psychological tensions, and how relaxation can help eliminate them. By relaxing muscles that have no role to play and adopting a \"state of flux,\" it becomes possible to work in a relaxed state and achieve perfect coordination of movement. The key to attaining perfect relaxation is to have an interest in the work at hand, which helps in working with the utmost efficiency while being perfectly relaxed.",
  "content": "It is indeed possible to work in a relaxed state. Some of the scholars have referred to a “state of flux”. In order for us to understand the idea, it is enough to remind ourselves of the motionlessness bordering on ecstasy which seizes us during the scant moments of intense psychological work. What is required for the sake of fully comprehending the meaning of our precept is to remember the perfect coordination of movements (and the resultant elimination of any move that is alien to the purpose to be accomplished) by which the intelligent manual worker carries out his job. The physical tension which constantly endures in the adult man when he is in a wakeful state corresponds to an equivalent amount of wasted energy. Once the learner grasps the entire scope of the method, he will discern that the prior orientation 23 towards having an interest in the work to be implemented will then turn into the surest condition for attaining perfect relaxation. In other words, it will become exceptionally easy to work with the utmost efficiency while at the same being perfectly relaxed.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving a relaxed state while working requires discipline and a conscious effort to eliminate any unnecessary movements. Once this habit is established, the coordination of movements will improve, and wasted energy due to physical tension will decrease. By avoiding small tics or tensions and maintaining absolute silence, one can maximize efficiency while being perfectly relaxed."
