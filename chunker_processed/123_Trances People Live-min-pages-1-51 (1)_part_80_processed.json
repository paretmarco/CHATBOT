  "title": "\"How can depotentiating habitual frames of reference help patients recognize and overcome their limitations?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the concept of habitual frames of reference and its impact on a patient's consciousness is explored. The author argues that altering these frames can lead to depotentiation of personal limitations. In the last 200 tokens, the author introduces the idea of misidentification as a common problem faced by patients in therapy. This problem takes up significant space in their consciousness and often leads to fear of intimacy. However, the author suggests that by becoming the knower of the problem and observing it objectively, patients can detach themselves from it and create more space for other experiences in their inner world.",

  "last_phrase": "In order to overcome the fear of intimacy and create a larger context for personal growth, it is important to observe and identify the problem as separate from oneself. By developing an awareness of the problem and shifting focus to the space in which it arises, one can begin to diminish its hold and transform their perception of themselves and their experiences. Consider exploring the principles of Eastern philosophy or the concept of Quantum Consciousness to aid in this process. Remember, you are not your thoughts, but the context in which they occur."
