  "title": "What is Periodicity and Quantum Psychology? Exploring the Connection Between Neurological Processes and Multi-Dimensional Awareness.",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the principles of Quantum Psychology, emphasizing that changing inferences and maps only impacts the thinking dimension. The \"I\" trying to make the changes is part of the nervous system and the thought itself. The author then explains that to experience the Quantum level, one must go into the Nonverbal I AM, the silence, and Beyond. In the Appendix of The Tao of Chaos, the author wrote an article called \"On Compassion,\" where stages within the biological dimension are discussed. This text provides insight into how the nervous system works and how we can understand our thoughts and beliefs in a more profound way.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Changing inferences and maps only impacts the thinking dimension. The \"I\" trying to make the changes is part of the nervous system and thought itself. This is why change is so hard. Within each thought or belief (since it is a by-product of the nervous system) is the survival mechanism (fight/flight) of the nervous system itself. So each thought and changer of thought is part of the thought itself which is a by-product of the nervous system. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE To experience the Quantum level, one must go into the Nonverbal I AM, the silence and Beyond. With all of this in mind, in the Appendix of The Tao of Chaos, \"I\" wrote an article called \"On Compassion\" where I spoke about possible \"stages\" within the biological dimension. The first stage is the \"grounding\" in one's body, the second stage, the realization of the body being made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE as everything else. It should be noted that the body is ultimately not a vehicle of the soul. As will be discussed later, the body-soul are one and are made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the interconnectedness of our body and mind is essential for personal growth and development. Quantum psychology principles teach us that changing our thinking patterns only impacts the thinking dimension, but to experience the quantum level, we must go beyond the verbal and connect with the nonverbal I AM. Practicing body work such as yoga and Tai Chi can help link together all dimensions and increase our multidimensional awareness, ultimately leading to a more fulfilled life."
