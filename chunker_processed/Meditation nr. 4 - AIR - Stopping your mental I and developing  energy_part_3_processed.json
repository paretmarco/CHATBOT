  "title": "\"What are the Secrets of the Chivalry of the Grail in Perceval and how can we achieve a higher level of awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discussed the power of mindfulness and staying in the present moment. The author emphasized the importance of being aware of every part of the body, including the lungs and the air we breathe. The text concludes with a reference to a Celtic mystery initiation involving the fifth castle - the castle of the air. In this part, the protagonist, Perceval, encounters a dead corpse with a sword in his head and must let go of thinking to free the blood from passions. The last 200 tokens provide a powerful exercise that helps to strengthen the mind and body, leading to inner power.",
  "content": "You have everything. But you don't notice it.",
  "last_phrase": "Congratulations, preux chevalier! By winning the four elements and achieving a higher level of awareness through the meditation of the air and merging body and heart, you can now stay in the world with a greater sense of control and understanding of your physical, emotional, and mental self. Remember that you have everything you need, and it's important to stop and notice it. Keep practicing awareness to continue growing on your path."
