  "title": "What is the Enneagram and How Can it be Used for Communication and Personal Growth? Hypnosis and Self-Hypnosis Techniques Explored.",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the concept of the enneagram, which describes nine different personality types. The enneagram can be used as a communication tool and can help us understand ourselves and others on a deeper level. The author also touches upon the use of hypnosis in communication and how it can be used to alter behavior patterns. The last 200 tokens focus on the different enneagram types, ranging from the Challenger to the Peacemaker, and how each personality type interacts with others in different ways. The author provides key motivations and channels of representation for each type, making it easier to understand them.",
  "content": "In the mysterious world of emotions, that many of us refuse, escape from or do not understand, there are deep mechanisms by which people lose responsibility for their actions that are automatic, so that they suffer or enjoy the results of their behaviour without realizing, until they get to the point where, if they are suffering, they attach the blame to somebody else according to their own strategies. Hypnosis is, therefore, a natural state that Man finds himself involved with in the act of living; s/he is able to bring it on or induce it in others, or s/he may experience it without knowing that it is called hypnosis. All kinds of efficient communication are hypnosis. It is a road that takes us to our mind, a fast path, sometimes rapid and sometimes steep. Hypnosis is the deep communication that you establish between two individuals. A hypnotist is a type of pilot who is able to alter a collision course in any of his passengers’ needs. The hypnotized individual is someone who allows himself to be hypnotized. In this state of consent, the left hemisphere becomes “surrounded” and in such a case, suggestions can be uncritically accepted by the subject and, consequently, translated into concrete actions. In a state of hypnosis, the subject’s will is not eliminated, it is as if the subject concedes a privileged audience to the hypnotist, lending him/ her maximum attention to what is being proposed, totally conserving his freedom to do or not do whatever is being suggested to him/ her.",
  "last_phrase": "Hypnosis is a natural state of the human mind that can be induced to achieve deep levels of relaxation and create internal processes for personal transformation. While it is a powerful tool for personal growth, it is important to approach hypnosis with a clear objective and understanding of the processes involved. By using hypnotic communication models and inducing a state of deep relaxation, it is possible to create a hypnotic induction that can be used to alter habits, increase energy, and achieve specific goals. Learning self-hypnosis is also an effective technique for resolving everyday problems and increasing personal abilities. With practice, anyone can master the art of hypnosis and unlock the power of their own mind."
