  "title": "\"How does Prof. Erminio Di Pisa's fascination technique help overcome fears and anxieties?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of mental therapy, particularly through the use of ocular concentration and fascination, as developed by Professor Erminio Di Pisa. The previous sections discuss the connection between fear and anxiety disorders and the mechanisms that produce negative fascination. In the final part of the text, the author provides three exercises to develop magnetic power, positive speaking, and a magnetic look. These exercises help improve circulation and endurance, and they encourage practitioners to focus their attention on one thing only. The article emphasizes that nothing is achieved without effort, but with self-straining, the training can lead to significant benefits for one's health and well-being.",
  "content": "In addition, these exercises improve the circulation of blood and help one endure cold better. We set out here three compound exercises aimed at securing magnetic look and positive speaking for your persons. 1. While in a half-lit room, let your look fall upon any point whatsoever, provided it is at the same level as your eyes, and stare at it intensely, without beating your eyelids, for some fifteen minutes. You must practice this exercise on a daily basis, so that you can progressively extend its duration. NB: You will accomplish your goal more rapidly if, when you read or write, you refrain from beating your eyelids. 2. Every day you must read a few pages, speaking slowly as you do so and getting accustomed to stress every syllable gravely, without however straining your voice. You should remind yourselves that an exact, energetic, firm and resolute word which is uttered properly produces very strong reactions in other people’s minds. 3. When you are alone, place yourself in front of a mirror which is able to reflect the image of your whole person. At that stage, verbalize a suggestive formula (e.g. : ‘Look at me in the eyes ...’). Imagine yourself in front of a subject, and accompany what you say by gestures. Try out several possible formulas, so that you are finally able to choose the one suiting you the most. Repeat this exercise many times, scrupulously and attentively, until you experience the sensation your action would have to produce on the subject.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing these compound exercises consistently can help you achieve a magnetic look and positive speaking, as well as improve your circulation and cold endurance. Remember to practice daily and gradually increase the duration and difficulty of each exercise. Find the formulas and techniques that work best for you and strive for emotional and mental control. As with any exercise, it takes patience and persistence to see results, but the benefits are worth the effort."
