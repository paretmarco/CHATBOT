  "title": "How can you effectively operate in trading markets as a professional instead of relying on intuition alone?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned that trading is a profession and requires a well-defined strategy to operate effectively. The successful trader operates on both a linear level of cause and effect and a higher intuitive level. In the last part (200 tokens), the text emphasizes that a balance should be maintained between these two levels, and self-fulfilment should be the driving force behind the decision to become a trader. The importance of utilizing methodologies of self-hypnosis to access the intuitive level is discussed, and the dangers of solely relying on intuitive acumen or linear thinking are highlighted.",
  "content": "For this level, the utilization of methodologies of self-hypnosis will prove to be highly beneficial, and in fact almost an indispensable necessity. Accessing such a higher level is premised, however, on the prerequisite of being balanced and following an orderly line in the choices one makes. What that essentially entails is the fact that the choice of practicing a trader’s activity should be based on a specific decision to attain self-fulfilment rather than on the mere advantage of working from home or earning quickly. In the realm of actual reality, it is impossible to function purely in a linear sense, since by operating that way we would be neglecting several elements, and would fail to make use of our intuitive acumen. If there existed, in fact, an automatic way for scoring gains, it would have been converted, sooner or later, into a software which all the traders in the world would have come to possess after a short while, whereupon we would be thrown back to our initial departure point. However, it is likewise impossible to operate only on the basis of “intuitive acumen”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving success in trading requires a balanced approach that balances intuition with logic. Utilizing self-hypnosis techniques can aid in accessing higher levels of intuition, but it's important to make deliberate decisions based on self-fulfillment rather than quick financial gain. Developing a trading system and defining positive objectives can also greatly benefit traders. Ultimately, it takes a combination of experience, intuition, and strategy to succeed in the world of trading."
