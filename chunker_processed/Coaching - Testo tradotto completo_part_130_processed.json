  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the concept of being trapped in a trance, when we're on autopilot and not fully present in the moment. In this final section, the author discusses the technique of \"presence\" as a means of breaking free from trances and living a more conscious life. The author argues that by maintaining a direct sensory reference, we can perceive reality as it truly is, rather than being caught in worries and automatic reflexes. This transformation simplifies living and makes it more immediate. The author cites the example of being present during a trip to a foreign country as a metaphor for this experience. By being more present, we become more ourselves and more capable of truly making decisions.",
  "content": "It is then that reality appears to be livelier, and it is then that we become capable of truly making decisions. It is only at that point, therefore, that we might become able to determine our purposes and bring them to fruition. The average man is \"devoured by the mental side\", i.e. he is caught in worries, cogitations and automatic reflexes. Yet a deeper basis does exist. This basis consists in a state in which we perceive reality as it truly is. We might draw a simile with the way we feel during a trip to a foreign country. In such a context, in fact, we are usually more present than is the case when we are in our own motherland: Sounds appear to us to be stronger and sensations more real. We are more ourselves because of the fact that the new environment stimulates our sensory aspect. When people speak of man utilizing only a part of his true potential, they have this in mind. Pressing forward entails a transformation of oneâ€™s own being which simplifies living and makes it more immediate, as it becomes more conscious.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by being more present and conscious of our surroundings, we can tap into our true potential and transform our being, simplifying life in the process. It is only by centralizing and being present to ourselves that we can understand the relativity of everything, and ultimately, control our own personal power. Don't rejoice or despair about worldly dominium as it is nothing in the grand scheme of things."
