  "title": "What is The Way of the Human and how does it explore our connection to our body, mind, and the universe?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final portion of the text, the author explores the concept that denying our connection to our body and animal nature leads to isolation, alienation and misunderstandings. By exploring The Way of the Human, we are encouraged to have a different kind of discipline and focus of attention, one that involves looking at our limitations and how we dissociate from our bodies and minds. The text questions the idea of dissociation from our animal and emotional nature, pointing out that denying our connection to the world is ultimately a denial of our Quantum Consciousness.",
  "content": "This disconnection from our body and our animal nature leads us into more isolation, aloneness, alienation and misunderstandingsâ€”in short, our False Core (to be discussed in Volume II). Ultimately, to deny our connection to our body denies our connection to the world. To deny our connection to the world is to deny our connection to the universe and to the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness. In the past, oftentimes yoga in the form of mantras, yantras, and tantras has taken us out of the world. Spiritual philosophies have claimed, \"You are not your body,\" and that sex and emotions are to be avoided. Yet, as many a fallen guru and spiritual master might now finally concede, this is not possible. The question is why would anyone want to? If there is only THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, what is there to get rid of? Why would you even want to get rid of your animal or psycho-emotional nature, or as you might say, \"As you judge, so shall you be judged.\" Or in Quantum Psychological terminology, \"As you judge yourself, so shall you judge others.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To deny our body and our animal nature is to deny our connection to the world and the universe. The Way of the Human includes and embraces it all, recognizing that everything is made of the same substance. By recognizing and including our psycho-emotional and animal nature, we can deepen our realization of the underlying unity of Quantum Consciousness and experience the present moment fully. This understanding can help us overcome isolation, aloneness, alienation, and misunderstanding, bringing us toward a more stable and integrated state of being."
