  "title": "\"How can we attain mastery over our mind and body to eliminate useless emotions and actions?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the importance of eliminating useless automatic activities and moral eradication of emotions that act as a hindrance. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the need for individuals to analyze their problems and desires to determine if they need immediate solutions or if they are arbitrary. Moreover, the author sheds light on how acts generated by carelessness are bleak and colorless, whereas voluntary acts are determined by a well-defined psychological coloration. To be intelligent, one should look for the shortest route to arrive at the result and study the manner in which they can accomplish their goals with minimal effort. Material and moral readiness is essential to engage in purposeful activities.",
  "content": "Assuming the decision we reach is a negative one, we should put an end to any thought about it; as for the scenario where an affirmative answer is given, the problem has to be tackled. Useless acts, words and gestures are all generated by carelessness, and by lack of a genuine interest in and sincere desire for any thing. These acts are carried out under the influence of a bleak, colourless state of mind; whereas voluntary acts are those which are determined by a neatly defined psychological coloration. Being intelligent Always look for the shortest route to arrive at the result. When you have finally resolved upon doing a particular thing, you should pause once more, this time in order to study the manner in which you are going to accomplish it with the minimum possible effort. This truly means to be intelligent. You must therefore ready yourself, both materially and morally, in such a way that all the surrounding circumstances favour your engagement. From a material point of view, you should pay heed to your physical disposition and to the tools or persons who are required in order for your purpose to materialize.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we should strive for a genuine interest in our pursuits and engage in actions that are purposeful and intelligent. By mastering our minds and bodies, we can avoid useless acts and tensions and conserve our energy to achieve our goals with minimal effort. It's important to be vigilant and flexible in our thinking, clearing away unnecessary thoughts that hinder our progress. With the right tools and mindset, we can streamline our paths to success and avoid wasting our time and resources."
