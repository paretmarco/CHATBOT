  "title": "\"How can one develop the capacity for spontaneous actions and positive habits?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of this text dive deeper into the practical application of the modus operandi discussed earlier. The author suggests that by delegating control over certain actions to the unconscious mind, we can focus on being present and observant of ourselves. The natural prerequisite for this is a clear connection with oneself and the acquisition of positive life habits. It is also important to create a positive image of how we will feel when we follow these habits, but this is only necessary at the beginning. The author emphasizes the simplicity of this approach once it becomes a habit. The concepts of unconscious mind and positive life habits are important to understand this text.",
  "content": "For example, at the time of eating, all that is required would be to send a simple question to one’s body, by which we ask it to choose what is actually beneficial, without indulging in any additional thoughts, but rather taking care to keep on being present to our own selves. The natural prerequisite of such modus operandi, of course, is to have a clear connection with ourselves, and the acquisition, either spontaneously through one’s inbred nature or as a result of learning, of positive life habits, which are hygienic and beneficial, together with having conscious awareness of such nice habits. We are, in other words, enjoined to gain prior access to that particular inward “sense” whereby our own body flexibly replies to us and tells us what benefits it. In the beginning, we might make the path for such bodily response smooth by resorting to the creation of a positive image showing us how well we are going to feel if we followed the rules. The image thus conjured up and visualized is, however, especially necessary at the initial stage only. Thereafter, everything is going to unfold itself in a simple way.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by cultivating a clear connection with ourselves, adopting positive habits, and staying present in the moment, we can create a smooth path for our body to tell us what benefits it. Similarly, in our relationships with others, leaning on our unconscious and staying in touch with inner harmony can lead to greater spontaneity and positive interactions. So take the time to listen to your body and practice mindful communication for a happier, healthier life."
