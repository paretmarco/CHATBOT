  "title": "How to Work with Age Regression: Recognize, Observe, and Unfold the Inner Child Trance in Present Time.",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the concept of age regression and how it can create inner child trance experiences. In the last 200 tokens, the author advises on how to work with age regression by allowing resisted experiences to unfold and identifying the trance. The example of a woman who developed a trance experience called \"being cute\" to survive her childhood environment is given. The job is to awaken from the inner child's trance and become an observer/creator of present-time experience. The author underscores the importance of recognizing when one is in an inner child trance and identifying it as the first step in getting out.",
  "content": "In order to survive the childhood environment, she had developed a trance experience, called \"being cute.\" It worked in that situation, and certain episodes in her present-time adult environ- ment triggered the child within to hypnotize the adult in present time. The Next Step Working with Age Regression Remember. Re-member. To re-member is to become a member of present time reality. When handling age-regressed states completely and totally, allow the resisted experience to unfold. In other words, you need to look at whatever chaos (trauma) or memory caused the observer to \"stop action\" or push \"pause\" on the film. It was the resistance to looking at what was occurring that placed the movie on \"hold,\" to be reviewed again, and again, and again. Step I: Identify the trance. The most important step in getting out of an inner child trance is to recognize you're in it. Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) would say, \"In order to get out of a jail, first you must realize you're in one.\"",
  "last_phrase": "To break free from the inner child trance and age regression as an adult, it's essential to recognize and acknowledge its presence. By stepping out of the trance and becoming an observer, you can start working with age regression by identifying the trance and answering the associated questions. As you do so, embrace the resisted experiences to allow them to unfold and enable yourself to become a member of present-time reality. Remember, awareness is the first crucial step towards healing the dark side of the inner child."
