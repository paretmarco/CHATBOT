  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the author takes us deeper into the VOID and allows the EMPTINESS to condense down into various configurations with no subject/object. These configurations include connection, observation, thinking, balance, will and strength, value, and completeness. The author emphasizes that everything is equally valued and rooted in ONE SUBSTANCE. The configurations are allowed to be reabsorbed into the EMPTINESS as the label is taken off. The author invites readers to explore the truth and wisdom in these configurations beyond subject and object.",
  "content": "Allow the EMPTI. NESS to condense down and form a configuration of balance with no subject/object, everything in balance. Take the label off allow that to be absorbed back into the EMPTINESS. Allow the EMPTINESS to condense down and to form the configuration, as it condenses down, of will and strength, strength with no subject/object, will with no subject/object. Allow awareness to go further and further back into the EMPTINESS and allow the EMPTINESS to condense down and create the configuration of value in that we all belong to THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Value with no subject/object. Because everything is equally valued, hence, no significance. Finally, allow THE EMPTINESS to condense down and form the configuration that we all have the same roots,. That everything is rooted in THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. Take the label off, allowing this to be reabsorbed into the EMPTINESS. Going further into the VOID, allow the EMPTINESS to condense down and form the configuration of things being complete, whole, with no subject/object, just complete in and of themselves, complete just as they are. Take the label off, allowing that being complete in and off itself to go back into the EMPTINESS.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing the idea of emptiness allows us to see things as they truly are, without the burden of labels and subjective judgement. By allowing the void to condense down into various configurations, we can tap into the strength, value and completeness that exists in all beings. Appreciating the non-essentiality of the universe helps us find balance and recognize our connection to the one substance, ultimately leading to a richer experience of life."
