  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to observer-created reality and Deep Trance Phenomenon?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the impact of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle on modern physics and the philosophical interpretations it has given rise to. The author, Nick Herbert, identifies eight different schools of thought in the scientific community, including the Copenhagen interpretation, which is the center point of Quantum Psychology. In this interpretation, there is no reality in the absence of observation and observation creates reality. This has led to the idea that consciousness alters the world itself, as our subjective experience is observer-created. The text concludes by suggesting that we, as the knowers of our experience, have an active influence on the reality we experience.",
  "content": "(p. 17) In amplifying the Copenhagen interpretation of Heisenberg's Uncer- tainty Principle, Fred Wolf (1981) cites another physicist's view: Eugene Wigler, Nobel prize-winner in physics, believes that our consciousness alters the %%forld itself, because it alters how we appraise the future. That is, we experience the world the way we do because we choose to experience it that way. (p. 211) Wolf speculates: \"How could there be a mechanical universe out there if the universe changed every time we altered how we observe Because of the active influence exerted by the observer in this Quantum universe, quantum theorist John Wheeler has added a significant refinement by changing the word observer toparttopa- or, stating that \"no elementary phenomenon is a real phenomena until it is observed\" (I lerbert, 1985, p. 18). Translated into Quantum Psychological terminology, this means that how we subjectively experience events, interactions, and our own inner self is observer-createdâ€”created by us. This realitY suggests a further one: that we as the knowers of our experience.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the observer-created reality theory suggests that we are the knowers of our experience, and our consciousness alters the world around us. This theory has practical applications in therapy, where recognizing and understanding Deep Trance Phenomena can help individuals overcome their symptoms and create positive change in their lives."
