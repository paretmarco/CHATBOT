  "title": "How Can We Break Free from the Law of Least Resistance and Develop Our Creative Potential?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explains how our mind is limited by the law of the \"least resistance,\" causing us to repeat the same thoughts and restrict our creative potential. This is problematic in a world that rewards those who can come up with innovative solutions. In the final part, the author introduces the concept of freedom from automatic mechanisms, which prevent us from realizing our potential and rob us of our time and pleasure. This freedom is essential for developing one's creativity and finding original solutions. The author encourages the reader to break free from their mental chains and live a fulfilling life.",
  "content": "Accordingly, in this book, and through this type of coaching, we will not only convoy you to success (provided you want it for yourselves), which shines on whoever has the ability of finding original and effective solutions, but also, at the same time, to true freedom, freedom, that is, from a series of automatic mechanisms which divert you from your own selves by clouding the geniality of your mind, and which rob you of your life and your time, to such an extent that it is legitimate to say, with regard to some people who have always spent their existence steeped in a “routine”, ‘Though he officially lived for eighty years, in reality they were some twenty years at most’ 16. How does that come about? Man manufactures with his own hands the chains which fetter him and despoil him of his own life. These chains are represented by his thoughts and habits, which not only subtract from him time, but take away his pleasure as well. That is so as this quality appears to be captive to some phantasmal future, though man is unable to recognize it in the present.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to break free from the automatic mechanisms that cloud our minds and rob us of our time and pleasure. By avoiding a supine attitude towards social dictates, conventions, and societal norms, we can take control of our lives and achieve true freedom. This book and coaching aim to guide you towards success, but more importantly, towards a fulfilling life, free from the chains we manufacture for ourselves."
