  "title": "How does the absence of a significant person challenge one's sense of existence and structure of self-validation?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, a person discusses the finality of death and the impact of losing someone. They reflect on how the absence of a particular person challenges their sense of existence and makes them question the significance of their life. The concept of needing someone as a witness to validate their experiences is explored. The individual speaks of their past need to constantly create and maintain the presence of their father for 18 years, to validate their love and prove their existence. The current state of the individual is unknown.",
  "content": "How will I know that I exist if this person isn't witnessing me, what significance does my life have? And where it's come up around my mother. I don't have her to call up and say, \"Oh boy this is what it was like going through the past and all that.\" In the past, I think there would have been more sense, did I really experience that if I couldn't have that person as a witness. So if we go with this, \"how do I exist if I don't have this person there?\" Is that correct? Yeah, there's an element of that. How do I exist if this person is not there? What have been the consequences in your life to have the structure that says \"how do I exist if this person is not there?\" I had to keep that person right here all the time. I had to keep creating them. I did that with my father for 18 years. Constantly having that person there to prove my existence and to prove my love for them or to prove their importance of their existence to me. It's both ways. What's happening now?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize that our existence and significance aren't dependent on another person's witness. Over-relying on others to validate our existence can result in putting unnecessary pressure on them and ourselves, leading to the creation of false narratives or images. It's crucial to develop self-awareness and find internal validation, which can help us build more authentic and sustainable relationships."
