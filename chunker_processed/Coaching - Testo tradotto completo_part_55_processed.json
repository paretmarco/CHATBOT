  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, the text explores the idea that individuals can attain fulfilment by assuming control over their attention and becoming active and magnetically sound. The author notes that true personal magnetism requires individuals to be in harmony with their true beings and master their own thoughts. The text also highlights that individuals who achieve successful results without being in agreement with their true selves will always be dissatisfied. The concepts of Thought and Action and True and False varieties of Personal Magnetism are further explored.",
  "content": "Said in other words, such a person is ordinarily present to his own self and perceived by the other people as being “magnetic”, due to his ability to gather his vital energy together. When he acts, the action follows the thought at once, without any break. Assuming control of one’s own attention = Thought ? Action True and False Varieties of Personal Magnetism NB: It is also possible to get pathological magnetic individuals who somehow manage to achieve successful results in life. If they are not in harmonious agreement with their true beings, however, they will always be dissatisfied. The type of person we are concerned with in this book, however, is the active and magnetically sound individual The active and magnetically healthy person is indeed the one who is the master of his own thoughts. When he creates them, he neatly creates them in his mind. His state of presence and awareness shapes up the basis, the blank screen onto which the mental images the active and magnetic individual is able to give attention to of his own accord are projected from time to time.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, being a master of your thoughts and directing your attention to your true being is the key to becoming an active and magnetically healthy person. While some may achieve success through pathological means, it is only by following the path of nature that you can attract things that truly represent what you want. Don't exhaust yourself by trying to create an artificial magnetic charge; instead, focus on being present and aware of yourself and your surroundings."
