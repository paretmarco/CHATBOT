  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, various techniques and exercises are discussed, including self-hypnosis, the Campanelli Method, and how to deal with burnout. The section also delves into Hermeticism and quantum physics, exploring the symbols and elements and how they relate to our consciousness. Specific exercises are provided for creating change, balance, and harmony within ourselves. Additionally, the Trabona Method and Modified Akstein Method are introduced as ways to move and work on problems, respectively. Overall, this section offers a comprehensive approach to healing and self-discovery.",

Implicate and explicate exemples the double slit experiment example of the light exemple of elections We can speak of quantum systems Even our mind is a quantum system Your body is an implicate order We will see now an exercise to understand it Quantum exercise to put away an emotion We continue exploring ourself Notice now the space between thoughts Explicate and implicate again? Who is behind your thoughts? Now we come back to the symbols and we see the symbols of the elements, one arrow up fire arrow down water etc...

Do attention on the space between each breath What is between each breath? There is YOU Hermeticism and quantum physics are linked.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, hermeticism and quantum physics intertwine in their understanding of symbols, and there is a relationship between our inner psyche and the symbolism we express in our physical touch. By exploring the symbols of the elements and understanding the archetypal and derivative nature of symbols, we can work on de-identifying and breaking patterns of behavior. Through exercises like the Enneagram and Indian Self Hypnosis, we can learn to access our inner senses and increase our sensitivity to the universe, ultimately leading to a greater sense of freedom and self-awareness."
