  "title": "How Does Multi-Dimensional Awareness Integrate Self-Actualization and Self-Realization in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author describes their journey from feeling self-defeating to feeling more in touch with their body and feelings through psychology. However, they still felt unfinished and decided to seek self-realization in India through yoga and Buddhist practices. The author soon realized that to attain this level of consciousness meant giving up the world, which was impractical and unrealistic for most people. They struggled with compartmentalizing the spiritual from the material and eventually discovered multi-dimensional awareness, where self actualization meets self-realization. This concept is incorporated into Quantum Psychology which integrates the self-actualization of the West with the self-realization of the East. The author emphasizes the importance of accepting our biological-animal selves and understanding that qualities of essence are not limited to just our thinking or emotional dimensions.",
  "content": "I had compartmentalized the spiritual or quantum world, on the one hand, and the thinking, emotional and biological, on the other. It was \"as if one dimension of The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness manifestation negated the other. If I were in one dimension—for example, the emotional—the awareness of the EMPTINESS or underlying unity or interconnected fullness was lost or, at best, became a memory. I soon realized that I was compartmentalizing, separating the \"spiritual\" from the material. Multi-dimensional Awareness, therefore, is where self actualization meets self-realization. It is where the external, thinking, emotional and biological-animal are no longer separate from the underlying unity. In short, Quantum Psychology incorporates and includes the self-actualization of the West with the self-realization of the East through Multi-dimensional Awareness. For this reason it is important to let go of idea of \"health\" at a thinking or emotional dimension—such as always being unconditionally loving or always forgiving—and understand that this is a not a quality or function of the thinking or emotional dimensions but is a quality of ESSENCE. In this way, we can begin to accept our biological-animal, our thinking and emotional dimensions and their \"limitations.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In order to develop a multi-dimensional, functional awareness and reach the underlying unity of our quantum nature, it is important to let go of the compartmentalization of the spiritual and material world. Embracing our biological, emotional and thinking dimensions, while understanding that unconditional love and forgiveness are qualities of essence, not just the thinking or emotional dimensions will allow us to discover our true self without losing any part of our human nature. This integration leads to the meeting of self-actualization and self-realization and enables us to uncover the depths of our quantum consciousness."
