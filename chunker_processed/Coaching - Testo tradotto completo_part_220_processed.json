  "first_phrase": "This text is about the process of goal setting and achieving success in various areas of one's life. The author emphasizes the importance of focusing on positive aspects and available resources rather than negative ones. The text is divided into three phases: identifying positive features and available resources, envisioning the ideal state, and dreaming up the means to achieve it. The last 200 tokens provide two methods for exercising the third phase, one involving visualization and the other involving writing down ideas. The methods help to overcome worries and obstacles and to develop a logical sequence of phases towards achieving one's goals. The author provides practical exercises that readers can follow to achieve their desired outcomes.",
  "content": "Exercise 44 – Dreaming up the means - method 1 Look at a light – Close your eyes and “dream up” your aim. See it inside the light, or behind it, in any event within a setting in which this light is present (It might even consist in a lamp). Proceed as if you were retracing your steps, immersed at this stage in your imagination, and letting yourself feel somewhat certain of arriving at destination. Open your eyes, and enjoy the feeling of satisfaction by linking it to your body (in a state of self-awareness thereof). This exercise is also good if one wants to conquer his worries. Exercise 45 – Dreaming up the means - method 2 This exercise is quite similar to the previous one, the only difference being the fact that, instead of releasing a slight conviction that we are going to reach the goal, we are going to repeat the act of observing the light a number of times (ranging from two to three), and each time we are going to record in writing whatever idea might occur to our mind. We will notice that a logical sequence of phases will manifest to us.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises provide practical methods for generating ideas and overcoming worries to achieve your goals. By visualizing your aim through a light or mirror, and recording your ideas, you can establish a logical sequence and make progress towards your desired outcome. Remember to stay open to new opportunities as your planning evolves."
