  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, we delve into the experiences of Donato, a man who revolutionized the practice of hypnosis through his rediscovery of \"Fascination\". Donato's techniques were so successful that he could hypnotize hundreds of people within four months. He introduced changes to the method to make it even faster and more effective, and he used brutal actions to produce a stronger encephalic congestion. Donato's techniques caused sensation and controversy, and even attracted the attention of academics such as Professor Morselli.

  "content": "Ele introduziu alterações no método do mestre, melhorá-lo no processo com o objetivo de garantir o hipnose ainda mais rápido. Ele conseguiu isso por tê-lo precedido de uma ação brutal ter o efeito de produzir um forte congestionamento encefálica. Ele provocaria o assunto para relaxar em frente a ele, com os braços soltos pendurado pelos lados e, em seguida, pegando-lhe de repente de trás, ele iria fazê-lo girar em torno de si o mais rápido possível para aumentar, assim, a sensibilidade hipnótica.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by implementing changes to the master's method and improving it during the process, our expert was able to effectively achieve a faster and stronger hypnotic state through the use of a brutal action that produced a strong cerebral congestion. To induce relaxation in the subject, he would prompt them to hang their arms loosely by their sides and suddenly spin them around to increase hypnotic sensitivity.
