  "title": "\"How can breaking up conscious thinking benefit our mind and reconnect us with reality?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explains a procedure to break all conscious cerebral undertakings and attain a state of zero-ideation. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of achieving the state of consciousness of the void, or zero state. The key lies in shattering logical thought and breaking the representation of images that arise in our mind. The author provides examples of how different people might attain this state using different mono-ideation techniques. The author also discusses how our life is constantly pulled by opposites, and true wisdom only materializes beyond our thoughts. Ultimately, the goal is to utilize our forces together and direct their strength towards a single point.",
  "content": "Yet another individual might accomplish the purpose more successfully by “denying his attention to any conscious thought”, and by driving ideas away from his self with the same calm persistence by which a horse would swing its tail in order to chase out the flies. The one who wants to go even further might seek to reach the absolute zero. It consists in the consciousness of the void, of the zero (0) state, namely, what Plato used to call the idea of all ideas 34. Our life, by contrast, is constantly pulled by the opposites which are symbolized by the pair plus (+) and minus (-). Such an essential underlying sapience can only possibly materialize beyond our thoughts, as the latter screen us from perceiving reality. To sum up, if we want to accomplish some immediately attainable practical purpose, we would say that our constant concern must consist in the art of utilizing our own forces all together, by directing their whole strength towards a single point.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of utilizing our own forces by gathering our mental energy towards a single goal is a fundamental war strategy that allows us to resist formidable collisions and launch our own attack against fortresses. However, to truly establish a real life plan and attain happiness, we must also aim to reintegrate and connect with ourselves and reality, which can be achieved through the exercises presented above."
