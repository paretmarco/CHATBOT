  "first_phrase": "In this section, we explore the next developmental phase - Practicing Phase, which is observed from 10 to 16 months. During this phase, a child feels grandiosity and starts walking, gaining independence. In contrast, \"spiritual trance\" presenting \"I create my reality\" is a characteristic of those who are stuck in this phase. Referencing Ouspensky's work on self-remembering, the author discusses the developmental skill of moving from the inward to the outward world and vice versa, which is crucial for well-rounded multi-dimensional awareness.",
  "content": "(p. 1 19) THE NEXT DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE PRACTICING PHASE 1O MONTHS TO 16 MONTHS This period marks the time of huge grandiosity, the feeling of \"I can do anything.\" This is the time the child begins to walk and be independent and gets great joy from his or her accomplishments. This is the time of grandiosity. This is the place of developmental stuckness we see in seminar leaders who sell their workshops with \"You can have anything you want.\" These seminar leaders could be viewed through the lens of developmental psychology as grandiose or psychopathic. They're either grandiose because they believe \"You can create it all\" and are thus stuck in the practicing period. Or perhaps they're pathologically narcissistic and think they're the center of the universe and can do anything.Or they might know it's not true but care only about making money and being rich and famous, with no thought about the people they are taking advantage of. ________________ Special Section SPIRITUAL TRANCE \"I CREATE MY REALITY\" In New Age circles, this is the cry of people who are developmentally arrested at this stage.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to understand that the developmental phase from 10 to 16 months is a time of grandiosity and practicing new skills. However, it is crucial not to get stuck in this phase and to recognize the limitations of our ability to control the external world. It is essential to have a realistic view and take responsibility for our internal experiences and emotions."
