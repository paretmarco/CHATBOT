  "title": "\"How can we achieve effective action by minimizing mental effort and tapping into the power of 'taste'?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, we learned about effective action and how it is best achieved when we minimize the mental effort involved. Now, we delve into the importance of the human will and how it is connected to our sense of taste, both literally and metaphorically. The author emphasizes the need for a uniform intent and presentification of future states to achieve our goals. They also explain that pre-visualization can be useful at the beginning, but ultimately we must establish contact with the deepest layers of our mind. By following the techniques presented, we will be able to fully experience the taste and wonder of life.",
  "content": "We simply “know” that at an inner level, we know it motion-wise. Pre-visualization might be of benefit at the beginning of our process to develop presentification. At a later stage, however, we will have to establish contact with the deepest nuclei of the mind. It is important, for the sake of exploiting such force, to understand the following psychological truth: The will is a power which is linked to the “taste” of what we accomplish. Put it in different terms: A particular reason turns into an energy component, and as such into an originator of actual efforts, when an element of “taste” becomes superimposed on it, with the result that the personality of the individual concerned is grabbed and struck by it. In the same way that an animal will head towards the food with a foreknowledge of its taste, we will be more effective in moving in one direction whenever we possess a more direct sensory perception of the “taste” of what we are going to attain. The techniques we are about to present here will lead you to fully experience the taste and wonder of life.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to fully exploit the power of our will, it is crucial to develop a sensory perception of the taste of what we wish to accomplish. By establishing contact with the primal motion of the cerebellum, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and our goals. Nonverbal communication, such as an increase in salivation, can indicate true involvement in a particular activity. As mentors, we should be aware of these phenomena in our apprentices. These techniques will guide you towards experiencing the taste and wonder of life."
