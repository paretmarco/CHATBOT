  "title": "What is the importance of understanding time and having an ideal direction in creating a fulfilling life plan?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is about understanding time as having two dimensions, planning and opportunities, and how we can use these dimensions to create a life plan that aligns with our aspirations and predilections. The LIFE PLAN is studied and refined through the help of the FRAMES OF THE SELF, which analyze the dimensions of our being: Health, Success, Relations, Culture, etc. Having an ideal direction is also essential, as it acts as a fulcrum for our actions. This last part of the text discusses how we can discover our ideal direction through practicing the method presented earlier.",
  "content": "They intersect along with the totality of life, and enable us to inject variety and harmony into our existence. They are like different colours which jointly contribute to create a unique image. Having an ideal direction If we are unaware of where to go, how can we possibly reach that point? Those who fail are the persons who do not know how to will. They lack some dominant ideal, one capable, in other words, of acting as a fulcrum for their actions. What therefore happens in their regard is a dispersion of energies: Most of such energies are dissipated in habit-driven actions, and devoured by emotions which are often unwanted. The good news, however, is that, at any given moment, we are able to take the decision of taking charge of the rudder of our ship, and that it is frequently less exhausting to steer it that way than to leaving it anchored by the harbour. Once we have elected to take that wise route, we would then have the capacity to head naturally for our ideal direction. One's ideal might be discovered through practicing our method.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, discovering and pursuing our own ideals through the discipline of our will can give direction and purpose to our lives. Our ideals are like colors that add variety and harmony to our existence. By establishing a connection with ourselves and setting coordinated aims, we can create organized mental representations and become autonomous centers of interest and activity, leading to a fulfilling and meaningful life. Remember, taking charge of the rudder of our ship may be less exhausting than leaving it anchored by the harbor."
