  "title": "\"How can we develop multi-dimensional awareness and go beyond our inner work to understand our larger context?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this chapter of \"The Way of the Human\", the concept of manifestation is explored from a Quantum Psychology perspective. The author discusses THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or EMPTINESS, and how it condenses down to form the pure Awareness, Witness, and the collective unconscious. The chapter also delves into the development of multi-dimensional awareness, which can help individuals maintain their humanness while spiritually connected. The principle of Quantum Psychology is emphasized, which highlights that what is true at one level may not be true at another level.",
  "content": "\"When\" THAT ONE SUBSTANCE contracts you get the universal concept of archetypes a by-product of the physics divisions which is that which archetypes of the collective unconscious are made (Volume III). The Collective Dimension forms and creates our deepest Archetype, the Archetype and concept of the I AM. As the No-State The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness State of I AM contracts further ESSENCE appears. With further contraction the personal unconscious, the body (nervous system), the external world, and the personal conscious mind are made manifest. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: What is true at one level may not be true at another level. So let's begin by differentiating so that we can go beyond each dimension of manifestation in order to liberate awareness (which had become fixated) within each dimension and then to go beyond even awareness and the awarER itself (to be discussed later). DEVELOPING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS As mentioned earlier the most frequently asked question is, \"How do I maintain my humanness and awareness of my body while keeping spiritually connected?\" The possible answer might lie in the ability to develop and maintain multi-dimensional awareness. This means first becoming aware of how and where you place your awareness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing and maintaining multi-dimensional awareness is essential to balancing one's humanness and spirituality. By becoming aware of how and where you place your attention, you can gradually move beyond each dimension of manifestation, liberating awareness within each dimension and going beyond even awareness and the awarer itself. So, strive towards developing multi-dimensional awareness to attain a deeper understanding of the self and the universe."
