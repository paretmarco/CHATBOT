  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, we discussed the impact of AI on the healthcare industry. Now, let's shift the focus to the ethical considerations when implementing AI in healthcare. In particular, we'll explore the case of Dr. Smith, who developed an AI system that could accurately diagnose patients with a rare disease.

Let's delve into this complex topic and consider the implications for the future of healthcare.",
