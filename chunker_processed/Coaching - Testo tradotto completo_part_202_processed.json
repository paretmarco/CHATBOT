  "title": "How do temporal sequences affect our self-expression and decision-making?",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens build on the concept of time introduced earlier. The text explains how the time of the self and the time of becoming exist side by side and how becoming is structured in a sequence of events. It also touches on the temporal horizon, sequences of events shaping our self, and the existence of our inward being beyond time. The text mentions examples of incongruous durations affecting self-expression outwardly. Overall, the text aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between time and self-expression.",
  "content": "This structuring in accordance with time sequences is a mental construction which is automatically worked out by our mind. While some people have a long temporal horizon, the temporal horizon of other people is short. Our self, our acquired personality, is made up of such sequences. As for our inward essential being, it is, by contrast, normally located beyond time. Sometimes our self might actually be based on a sequence marked by an incongruous duration, such that it might even prevent us from attaining our ideals and expressing ourselves outwardly. This is for instance the case of the person who, in order to make an impression on his friends (“self” characterized by too short a time sequence), fritters away all his assets; or even, on the other end of the same spectrum, the condition of the miser who does not spend on himself, and who is unable to realize that his life is subject to a temporal duration and is thus shortly drawing to an end.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding our temporal horizon and how it affects our behavior can help us better manage our lives and achieve our goals. By detaching ourselves from static notions of self and selecting appropriate time sequences, we can channel our energy and take small steps towards success. It's never too late to reevaluate our temporal horizon and make small changes that can lead to great results."
