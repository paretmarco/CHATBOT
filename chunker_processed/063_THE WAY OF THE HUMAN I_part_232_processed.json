  "title": "\"What is Korsybski's structural differential and how does it relate to identity and the nervous system?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores how the nervous system creates an individual's reality and psychology, and how the 'I' or 'observer' is part of this neurological process. The text notes that the psychology or 'I' is a by-product of the nervous system's fight/flight survival mechanism and is formed as an attempt to order and explain constant deprivation or over-stimulation. The text also emphasizes that the ego or 'you' is not in control and that the nervous system has already made all of the decisions, actions and claims before the ego comes into play.",
  "content": "Because the one that wants to get rid of (fill in the blank), the one to be gotten rid of and the \"observer\" of both are all by-products of the nervous system and contain the same fight/flight survival mechanism. \"It should be noted that \"you\" do not create or select out your own reality. The idea of \"you\" is a by-product of the nervous system which has formed this idea of a \"you.\" The idea of creating or selecting out and the \"you\" which follows have already done ALL of that choosing, creating, deciding etc., long before the you (which comes later) claims you did chose or created this or that. Thus, the ego, or what you call \"you,\" comes after the fact, event, etc., and creates explanations of choice, claims ownership of actions, justifications, motivations, preferences, volition and willâ€”when, in fact, it has none. 143 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness he I or ME is the name the body gives to and calls itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that the idea of \"you\" or the ego is a by-product of the nervous system can help you realize that you do not entirely create or select your own reality. The purpose of the nervous system is to organize chaos, and the shock of realizing separation and deprivation can lead to a break in your awareness of your biological core. It's essential to note that separation is a theory that explains what or why, and not what is. By understanding this, you can develop multi-dimensional awareness and have a better grasp of your psychology."
