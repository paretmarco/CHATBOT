  "title": "\"How can a reality check help to overcome illusions and effectively deal with feedback?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the concept of illusioning and how it affects individuals in therapy. The author shares how Dr. Herzberg, a noted industrial psychologist, describes how people define things based on their own needs. The text explores how reality checks can help determine if someone is illusioning and that it requires taking responsibility for transferred feelings. The author also discusses how feedback from the world can help individuals let go of illusions and integrate into present time. The final 200 tokens provide examples of how illusions may form in children and how lack of feedback can solidify illusions.",
  "content": "She was already in her age- regressed-child trance. The only way the small child could handle the bombardment she had to deal with was for the ob- server to develop a trance called illusioning, futurizing, and fantasizing. The child said, \"Someday, it's going to be better.\" A similar example might be a young boy who wanted to be a professional football player, but by the time he was 13, had given it up because of feedback from the world, i.e. he didn't make the team. He then wanted to be a basketball player. Since he was too short, he gave that up. He accepted feedback in present time a connection to the world, and integrated. When a person is in present time, he can allow and integrate feedback from the world. The individual will let go of illusions. Lack of feedback solidifies illusions. When the child cuts off feedback (family or world) to survive, illusions become more solid Illusioning â€¢ 87 and the intensity of the need not to see the family situation increases.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to let go of illusions and integrate feedback from the world, it's important to stay connected to present time. By doing so, we can accept and adapt to feedback, and pave the way for growth and development. Remember, illusions solidify in the absence of feedback, so always stay open to the world and let go of limiting beliefs."
