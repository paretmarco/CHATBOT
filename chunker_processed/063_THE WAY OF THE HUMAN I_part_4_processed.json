  "title": "What is The Quantum Psychology Notebooks and How Can They Help You Develop Multi-Dimensional Awareness?",
  "first_phrase": "This text is an introduction to the special section of Part I: Trances People Live Revisited, Part II: The Trance-ference: The Ultimaj E, Trance, and Part III: The Symbiotic Trance. The author explains that these three volumes are a series called The Way of the Human and were created as notebooks to be studied by the reader as they require previous background knowledge. The author also mentions a major influence for the work, Peter Madell, a doctor in Northern California, who called him after the release of Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology in 1990.",
  "content": "These books are therefore designated as notebooks, to be used as notebooks, with the assumption that the reader will study them and go back to the earlier Quantum Psychology Volumes since this present work in many respect might require some previous background. I decided to place the introduction prior to the dedication and acknowledgments because I wanted to be clear about who and in which \"book\" (of the three) the dedications should go. In other words, each Volume has different dedications and major influences. When this Quantum event \"began\" to solidify, the possibility of writing a three Volume series called the Way of the Human had not quite occurred to \"me.\" In this, the first of three Volumes, Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness, I wanted to encapsulate a major focus of Quantum Psychology the development of multi-dimensional awareness as a \"possible\" step in the discovery of Who You Are. MAJOR INFLUENCES As I was writing the introduction to The Way of the Human trilogy, I recalled that shortly after Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology was released in 1990, I received a phone call from Peter Madell, a doctor in Northern California.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these notebooks, designated as volumes in \"The Way of the Human\" trilogy, are a gateway to developing multi-dimensional awareness and discovering oneself. With influences from renowned Quantum Psychology experts and spiritual teachers like Nisargadatta Maharaj, this work is a valuable resource for those seeking self-discovery and personal growth."
