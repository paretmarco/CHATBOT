  "title": "\"How can intuition be understood as a physiological phenomenon and developed through experience?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author delves into the concept of intuition and the physiological phenomenon behind it. They discuss the research by Prof. Jeffrey Schwartz, which reveals how the human mind works when unveiling new solutions. In the last 200 tokens, the author talks about how intuition can be developed through building an \"informed instinct\" based on accumulated experience. The author also gives an example of financier George Soros, who uses his vast experience to act in an informed manner. The two essential aspects of the intuitive process are also explored.",
  "content": "How intuition can be developed Modern analysis says it is possible to learn how to develop intuition. That depends on building what has been termed an \"informed instinct\" 116. What it fundamentally means is that we do not rely on the most primitive instinct, which is the instinct of the inexperienced person. We rely on a higher level of functioning of the brain, one which does not take place in a wild fashion, but rather as a result of a specific process of development that is basically related to the experience one has accumulated. This experience is then processed in a special manner by our unconscious mind. Famous experts make use of this process. The financier George Soros recounts for instance the fact that, when the time for selling sets in, he perceives a \"specific sensation\" along the back, whereupon he comes to know that that is the best time for acting. Soros' experience in the field is vast. This large quantity of accumulated experience has enabled him to act in terms of very subtle “distinctions”, which allow the unconscious mind to function in an “informed manner”. Let us examine now the two essential aspects of the intuitive process.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing intuition is possible, and it requires building an \"informed instinct\" that is based on accumulated experience and processed in a special manner by our unconscious mind. To train our mind to work out distinctions, we should focus on building the necessary experience and knowledge. Remember that an \"observable\" is essential in defining a possible result, making intuition a valuable skill to cultivate."
