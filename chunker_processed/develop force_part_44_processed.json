The exercises include visual and auditory exercises, as well as physical practices like clapping and walking.

The last part of the text delves into exercises that cultivate the connection between seeing and watching, ultimately helping individuals practice both the first and second attention. The author highlights the significance of developing the concept of \"being there for yourself\" and using techniques such as penetrating gazes to achieve our goals. Exercise 21, which involves counting without counting, is discussed along with its significance in improving mental functioning.",
  "content": "Later you can check this list confronting it with the words on the page where the needle was plunged and if you do not match will be a sign that you were not be following exactly the prescriptive instructions and it would be good to repeat the exercise. In this case, it will be advisable to choose a different page. Exercise 21 â€“ count without counting Watch a series of slats or vertical elements and without counting how many there are. This exercise does not interest as memory. As Virgil says: \"when I see everything as a unity, I have more power\". Therefore, virtually we need to count objects without counting. This technique leads our minds to work better, eliminates mental difference between \"background\" and \"foreground\" expressed in Gestalt terms, namely between part and whole. Further comments on the last two exercises Virtually the last two exercises above mentioned will help us to connect the \"look\" with the \"watch\". This is a typical attribute of a person who is present. Normally this man combines two elements: the watching, which is the act of observing giving attention, and the seeing, which is the act of global perception. The two moments can also be defined as the first and second attention. First attention: it stands on the particular, on the item. Second attention: it defines the so-called global attention that can reach up to the so-called Ganzfeld (in German, unique field) where there are no more contours.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing exercises to improve our presence, focus, and perception can lead to a more powerful and complete vision of the world. By integrating our sub-sensorialities and developing our ability to see and watch simultaneously, we can connect different areas of our brain and increase our sensitivity. Remember to follow prescriptive instructions and check your progress regularly. If you encounter difficulties, repeat the exercise or choose a different page. Keep in mind that with practice and patience, you can awaken your magnetism and achieve a deeper level of consciousness."
