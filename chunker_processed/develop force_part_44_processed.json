  "first_phrase": "This text presents a series of exercises aimed at developing concentration and presence of mind. These exercises range from focusing exclusively on a single noise to counting the grains of a necklace without thinking of anything else. The final 200 tokens introduce Exercise 21, which focuses on counting objects without actually counting them in order to unite the mind's foreground and background. Through these exercises, the text aims to help readers cultivate a sense of presence that can be applied to everyday life, enabling them to better focus and connect with their surroundings.",
  "content": "Later you can check this list confronting it with the words on the page where the needle was plunged and if you do not match will be a sign that you were not be following exactly the prescriptive instructions and it would be good to repeat the exercise. In this case, it will be advisable to choose a different page. Exercise 21 â€“ count without counting Watch a series of slats or vertical elements and without counting how many there are. This exercise does not interest as memory. As Virgil says: \"when I see everything as a unity, I have more power\". Therefore, virtually we need to count objects without counting. This technique leads our minds to work better, eliminates mental difference between \"background\" and \"foreground\" expressed in Gestalt terms, namely between part and whole. Further comments on the last two exercises Virtually the last two exercises above mentioned will help us to connect the \"look\" with the \"watch\". This is a typical attribute of a person who is present. Normally this man combines two elements: the watching, which is the act of observing giving attention, and the seeing, which is the act of global perception. The two moments can also be defined as the first and second attention. First attention: it stands on the particular, on the item. Second attention: it defines the so-called global attention that can reach up to the so-called Ganzfeld (in German, unique field) where there are no more contours.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises are a great way to increase your presence and sensitivity. By practicing them daily, you can improve your ability to observe without counting, integrate your sub-sensorialties, and develop a stronger sense of unity between your body and mind. Additionally, the hot water/cold water exercise can help you overcome polarities and build your own reality. Remember to follow the prescriptive instructions carefully and later check your progress by confronting the list with the words on the page where the needle was plunged. If there are mismatches, it may be a sign to repeat the exercise or choose a different page."
