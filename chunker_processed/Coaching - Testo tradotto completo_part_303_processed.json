  "title": "\"What is the Substitution of Personality and Can it Help Improve Your Life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"substitution of personality\" and how it works. The process involves imagining an action being carried out by someone else, whose spirit and abilities we incorporate into our own selves to perform an action in the best possible way. This \"magical\" procedure actually has a scientific basis and is based on the physical-psychological correlation. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses how we can shape ourselves to fit different scenarios, envisioning ourselves as skilled acquaintances to excel where we might otherwise struggle. Overall, the focus is on learning and growing through substituting our own personality with new, more effective traits.",
  "content": "If the context in question is the conclusion of a business deal, what one of us would attempt to do is to shape himself up, in his inner envisioning, as if, in that moment, he actually was the friend of his regaled with the shrewdest commercial mind. In the event of a sentimental situation where he runs the risk of appearing clumsy, he would imagine himself to be his most adroit acquaintance, the most skilled one in the field of sentimental liaisons. As for the scenario where eloquence must be resorted to, he would conceive himself as being a great orator; and if he is called upon to put up a show of some energetically strong or violent person, he would envision himself to be his briskest companion. How would any of such substitutes act? Let us properly put up a warning that we are not dealing here with any issue of taking as oneâ€™s model either this or that acquaintance of ours. The issue is to successfully cause our own inward being to learn. It is a bit like shedding off the garment of our own personality by going to the length of replacing it with the new personality.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by studying the characters of people who inspire us and envisioning ourselves as them in different situations, we can improve our own personality and overcome timidity. It takes constant effort and a willingness to shed our own persona and adopt a new one, but the benefits are worth it. However, it's important to note that this technique won't turn a monster into a handsome person or a fool into a witty individual, but it can help us become the best version of ourselves."
