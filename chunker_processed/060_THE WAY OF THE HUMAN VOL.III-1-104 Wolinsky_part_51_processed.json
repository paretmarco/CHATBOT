  "title": "How Can We Expand Our Understanding of Death?",
  "first_phrase": "In the first chapter of \"The Way of the Human: Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the concept of death is explored through a conversation between Barbara and Wolinsky. Barbara struggles to come to terms with the idea of her mother's death and the meaning behind it. Wolinsky guides her on a journey of visualization and self-reflection to help her connect with her essence and the void beyond it. In the final 200 tokens, Wolinsky asks Barbara to imagine a condensed emptiness called Barbara, which is experiencing pain because she is the \"me,\" while her mother is the \"not me.\" The exercise helps Barbara face the discomfort of her own mortality.",
  "content": "Take the BIG EMPTINESS and condense it down and make it into another concept called mother. And then thin it out and make it back into BIG EMPTINESS. How are you feeling now? Real vibrating, lots of energy. So now I would like for you to be in your ESSENCE. This part you might want to do eyes open or eyes closed. You decide as we go along. So go into your own ESSENCE, then I want you to fall further back into that VOID beyond the ESSENCE. What's happening now? There's no separation. Go into it and take some VOID and condense it clown and make it into a mom and take some VOID and condense it down and make it into a Barbara. Now, decide that the Barbara is me and the mother is \"Not Me.\" Now, again, very slowly, intentionally decide that Barbara is me and mother is the \"Not Me.\" The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter 1 Barbara:It's hard to do right now. Wolinsky:Then imagine there is pain inside of this condensed EMPTINESS called Barbara because she's the me and mother is the \"Not Me.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by practicing the technique of condensing and thinning out the void, you can access your essence and go beyond it to experience the oneness of all things. By seeing the \"Not Me\" as made of the same substance as yourself and creating strategies to align with it, you can reduce pain and increase harmony in your life."
