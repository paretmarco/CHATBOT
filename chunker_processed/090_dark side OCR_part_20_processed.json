  "title": "\"How does the inner child's past hypnotize the present adult into problem states?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text delves into how the inner child can hypnotize the adult into problem states. The child internalizes the suggestions made by parents and other authority figures, which can continue into adulthood. The text explains how self-hypnosis and trance occur in our daily lives, and how individuals act as both hypnotist and subject in relationships. The purpose of the book is to awaken the individual behind the trance, leading to a clearer understanding of the self and avoiding problems resulting from trance states.",
  "content": "In our culture we all go in and out of trance states, and each of us acts as both hypnotist and subject, through most of our relation- ships. The purpose of this book is to awaken the you behind the trance, so that problems that are caused by trance states no longer can occur. Self-hypnosis and trance happen daily. If you notice the move- Where It All Began for Me + 9 meet of the mind, you are continually offering suggestions to yourself about how to be, what to do, and what to have. For example, you might suggest to yourself in your relation- ship, \"He really loves me,\" creating a relaxed \"He really loves me\" trance. You might suggest to yourself, \"She never gives me what I want,\" creating an angry trance. You might suggest to yourself, \"I know what that (boss) wants; he wants to \"cheat me,\" creating a self-righteous trance. All of these tapes are played by the inner child within the adult. The child within takes on the voices and suggestions of parents, and years later the child within the adult hypnotizes the adult. How does this occur?",
  "last_phrase": "To take control of your life and break free from harmful trance states, it is important to become aware of the suggestions you give yourself each day. By learning to recognize and change these patterns of thinking, you can liberate the \"you behind the trance\" and live a more fulfilling life. Remember that self-hypnosis and trance happen daily, but with practice and conscious effort, you can become the master of your own mind."
