  "title": "What is the teacher or guru trance and how does it relate to spiritual detachment and dissociation?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the idea of trance-ference in spiritual practice, how some individuals may prematurely detach themselves from their bodies as a defense mechanism, and become over-observers. This can occur when the internalized identity and omnipotent mother are transferred onto a spiritual figure. The author has encountered many spiritual aspirants exhibiting this process while living in India for six years. The schizoid personality, as referred to by Palmer, may appear spiritual but feel like they have nothing and are nothing. Dissociation or premature observation is a defense mechanism that protects one during trauma but may lead to detachment in spiritual practice.",
  "content": "They appear spiritual, but deep clown they feel as though they have nothing and are nothing. (Small nothing as in a lack.) This premature detachment actually is a defense. In other words, they look detached, but it is a defense against feeling. After living in India for six years and traveling and visiting with almost sixty teachers, ashrams, and gurus, I met many spiritual aspirants who were acting-out this schizoid process. They oftentimes had high cheekbones, a brittle bony structure and, in extreme cases, a film or coating over their eyes. When I looked into their eyes, even though they kept making lots of eye contact, I was unable to pierce through this covering. Very dissociative, and aloof, and appearing spiritual, the schizoid individual is terrified of engulfment, remaining very defensively detached as a defense against their underlying age-regressed fear; hence, to defend against feeling, they become over-observers. A by-product of meditation is dis-association, but it can be used as a way of \"spiritualizing dissociation, and using meditation as medication.\" Dissociation or premature observation is an automatic defense that protects you during trauma.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to understand that detachment and dissociation can be a coping mechanism against trauma, but if it becomes overused, it can hinder our ability to truly connect with ourselves and others. It's crucial to recognize and address any underlying fears and emotions, rather than relying solely on spiritual practices or external distractions. By doing so, we can cultivate a healthier and more authentic sense of spirituality and well-being."
