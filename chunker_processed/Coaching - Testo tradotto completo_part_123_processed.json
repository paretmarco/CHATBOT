  "title": "\"What are the Reference Point Exercises for self-awareness and freedom?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, various exercises related to self-awareness and the development of Presence as a path to freedom have been discussed. These exercises have been given numbers from 16 to 20, and the last exercise in the series is Exercise 21. Exercise 21 involves being aware of one's speech, which is an important aspect of self-awareness. The exercise is aimed at enhancing one’s consciousness of their words, thereby leading to greater self-awareness and self-improvement.",
  "content": "Let go of any thought about the focal point. Now you should merely gaze at your own selves in the mirror without blinking your eyes. Look intensely at yourselves between the eyes. By carrying out this exercise, you will come to notice a number of different sensations, and at some points you will lose self-consciousness. When that occurs, try to regain presence through the means of sensory attention. Exercise 19 – Constant awareness of one part of the body Keep a continuous awareness of one part of your body (such as one hand). Over a period of time, this exercise might be accompanied by focusing one’s attention on one of your feet (if possible the one located on the opposite side). The aim of these exercises is to start “remembering ourselves”. The goal is the further development of Presence as a path to freedom. Another interesting exercise consists in being conscious of your breathing while you are eating. Exercise 20 – Awareness of one’s breathing while eating. You should now extend your concentration to your breathing while you are busy eating. You must be conscious of the fact that you are eating. Exercise 21 – Awareness of one’s speech.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating these exercises into your daily routine can help you develop a constant state of awareness and presence. By focusing on various parts of your body, breath, and speech, you can improve your ability to be mindful of the present moment, leading to a greater sense of freedom and clarity in everyday life. So, let go of distracting thoughts and try incorporating these simple yet powerful practices into your daily routine today."
