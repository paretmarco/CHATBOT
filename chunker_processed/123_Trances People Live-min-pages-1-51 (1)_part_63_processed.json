  "first_phrase": "This text explores the intersection between Erickson's therapeutic trance state, the philosophy of Tao, and the Eastern meditation tradition. It emphasizes the paradoxical change principle, which entails increasing or amplifying problematic emotional responses to achieve healing. The concept of \"symptom as cure\" is illustrated through the Zen experience, where students use intense focus to enter an expanded state. This final part further elaborates on the principles of paradox and subtle wisdom in the Tao, providing a philosophical context for the practical application of these concepts in psychotherapy and meditation.",
  "content": "In the words of Lao-tzu (195ric: In order to contract a thing, one should show his standard first; in order to wea.ken, one will surely strengthen first; order to overthrow, one will surely exalt first; in order to take, one will surely give first. This is called \"subtle wisdom\" in the Tao, and it also reflects what contemporary clinicians call the law of paradoxical change: to change something, increase it rather than trying to undo it. if attention is already shrunken. shrink it more; amplify problematic emotional responses rather than trying to make them decrease. By doing this, you will become part of the Tao (according to Eastern wisdom, Tao-te Ching, Chapter 36), you will enter Erickson's state of therapeutic trance, and you will enter what I call the no-trance state. They are all similar, in essence. The paradox of \"symptom as cure\" as it relates to Eastern traditions is perhaps best illustrated in the experience of the Zen Rossi and fichaku describe the paradoxical process by which a Zen student uses the intense focus of the koan to enter an expanded sue (Rossi & Ryan, 1991): 40 .",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, paradoxical change suggests that to bring about change, focus on amplifying the issue rather than diminishing it. By doing so, one can enter a state of heightened awareness and become open to new possibilities. This approach is in line with Eastern wisdom and has been observed in the experiences of Zen students. Embrace subtle wisdom and find your way into the no-trance state, all by accepting the paradox of \"symptom as cure.\""
