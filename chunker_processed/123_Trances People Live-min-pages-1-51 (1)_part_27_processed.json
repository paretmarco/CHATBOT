  "title": "How do Pseudo-Orientation in Time, Post-Hypnotic Suggestion, and Age Regression interplay to shape our identities as trance states?",
  "first_phrase": "In this section, we delve deeper into the realm of Deep Trance Phenomena, which often lead us to recreate our past in the present. This is illustrated by the case of Jack, who suffered emotional distress triggered by a post-hypnotic suggestion during a feedback session with his boss. His attention quickly narrowed, causing him to regress to a certain age and activate a common trance identity experience. Thus, Jack's expanded state of confidence was suddenly replaced by a contracted state of anger and hopelessness, demonstrating how our sense of selfhood can drastically change due to trance phenomena.",

  "last_phrase": "In summary, understanding how our deep trance phenomena interact to create our symptoms and problems is key to taking control of our experiences, changing them, and ultimately viewing ourselves as creators rather than victims. Identifying and altering these clusters of deep trance phenomena is the path to empowerment and self-transformation. For a deeper exploration of the concept of trance states and their impact on identity, refer to Chapters 10 and 19."
