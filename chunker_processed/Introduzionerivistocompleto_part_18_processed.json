  "title": "What is Non-Verbal Language and Why is it Important in Communication?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of non-verbal language in communication. It details various aspects of body language such as gestures, behavior, and silence, which have been shown to comprise 55% of interpersonal communication in comparison to only 7% through words. The text describes how identifying body language cues such as breathing patterns, body posture, and gestures can help establish a positive relationship, forming a rapport with the other person. Effective communication is achieved through eliminating negative terms, refining language, and visualizing goals, leading to productive beliefs, and adopting a positive attitude. The last part focuses on NLP 3, including modeling success strategies and expressing emotions through non-verbal language.",
  "content": "It is the natural way of expressing our state of mind and it can bring us into direct contact with our deepest emotions: fear, anxiety and joy, which are directly transmitted by our hands, legs and facial muscles. Our mind can decide whether or not to express verbally these sensations or emotions, but we are aware that it is sometimes better to keep quiet. For example, we can say that we are not annoyed but a small, involuntary gesture by our body can give away what we are saying, though normally, nobody pays attention. There are various ways of classifying different states of mind and, for practical purposes, it is useful to focalize on some in particular in order to understand our communication with another individual, whatever the relationship may be. These are: 1. ATTENTION 2. INTEREST 3. PLEASURE 4. REFLECTIVENESS What are the gestures that accompany each of these states? Pleasure, for example, is perceived by way of specific gestures. Remember that CNV is sensorially demonstrated and it is so inherent in man that it can’t be conditioned in anyway. SOME NON-VERBAL SIGNS The attention that a person shows during listening to someone else is shown by the body posture. For example, leaning the chest forward is a sign of attention. Pleasure is connected to the lips and to the so-called analogical kisses. Biting the lips means: “I would like to but I can’t” The tongue is an indicator of strong pleasure towards the person, the subject being discussed, or the situation.",
  "last_phrase": "Understanding non-verbal communication and how it can vary between individuals is a powerful tool for establishing better communication and building stronger relationships. By observing body language and recognizing different representational systems and personality types, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the people around us. Through this understanding, we can create better connections and use effective strategies for personal and professional growth. Remember, communication is not just about the words we use, but also about the gestures we make and the emotions we convey through our body language."
