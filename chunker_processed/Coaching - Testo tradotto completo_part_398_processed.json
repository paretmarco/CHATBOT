  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author delves into the way in which ocular movements become linked to reflection, highlighting that it's crucial to grant yourself some space to reflect and reason things out. The text also warns against looking at a speaker all the time while he is addressing you as he could end up influencing you even if you think you're not giving him your attention. The author highlights that the man who claims no one can influence him is ignorant of the laws governing human influence.",
  "content": "In fact, however much your will to power might be strong, and however wide your cognitive grasp might happen to be, if you direct your look at a man all the time while the latter is addressing you in his speech, then, provided such man knows what needs to be done to turn the situation to his own advantage, he will no doubt end up influencing you. That is as certain as the fact that two plus two equals four. True, maybe you will not enact exactly what he would like you to do. True, it might happen that he is going to ask too much of you and you will accordingly turn him down. Nevertheless, in one way or another, he is going to have an influence on you. You might possibly concede to him certain things you would have denied his person if you had been in full possession of your faculties of reasoning. The man who pretentiously declares that no one is capable of influencing him is in fact totally ignorant about the laws in accordance with which human beings are influenced.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while it is true that others can influence us, it is also possible to increase your own presence and become less susceptible to such influence. By being mindful of your own thoughts and feelings, setting clear boundaries, and developing your communication skills, you can establish yourself as an authoritative and confident individual. Ultimately, it is up to you to determine the level of influence others have on you, and taking steps to strengthen your own presence can be a powerful tool in achieving this goal."
