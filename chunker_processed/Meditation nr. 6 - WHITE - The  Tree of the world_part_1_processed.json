  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores the idea of whether we simply pursue material goals in life or whether we are capable of tapping into a higher level of awareness. The text focuses on meditation, particularly Meditation no. 6 - The Tree, where the initiated chevalier draws energy from the force of nature and develops the quality of intuition. The text discusses how intuition can be impacted by emotions and how to discharge excessive emotions. It also discusses Chivalry as a Western inner martial art and its connection to nature. The last 200 tokens provide two exercises that encourage readers to connect with nature and deepen their awareness of their body and heart. The text also highlights the significance of trees in Celtic culture.",
  "content": "Do we go in life just following material goals or are we able in life to be aware of our higher level? Meditation nr. 6 - the Tree The initiated chevalier is in contact with the force of the Nature, and draws his energy from it The quality that corresponds to this level of awareness is INTUITION.

  "last_phrase": "As we conclude this meditation on the tree and its symbolism in chivalry, let us remember that our journey in life should not be solely focused on material goals. We can choose to be aware of our higher level, and one way to achieve this is through meditation and connecting with nature. The tree, a symbol of deeper forces around us, can provide us with intuition and guidance, but we must also learn to ground ourselves and be stable. Let us keep a part of our energy aware of this connection to the divine plane of consciousness, and not be submersed again by the illusion of materialism."
