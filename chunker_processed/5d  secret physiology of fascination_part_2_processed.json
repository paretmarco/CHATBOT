  "title": "\"How does fascination alter sensory perceptions through the eyes? A closer look at the Mandelbaum effect and other phenomena.\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses how fascination can bring a person into a passive state of consciousness by focusing on the eye as a primary tool. The author explains that the mind creates a make-believe world of labels and opinions when engaged in evaluating what is perceived, which is an unnecessary activity. The use of many elements connected to eye accommodation, such as dark focus, retinal locus, and sharpness of focus, can help achieve this passive state of consciousness. The last 200 tokens of the text delves deeper into the phenomenon of the \"big face\" and how changes in sensory perception can alter the apparent size of objects. The text explores the psychological and physiological correlates of this effect, demonstrating how it can contribute to greater discrimination of detail but also have negative consequences in situations such as aviation.",
  "content": "This phenomenon happens in fascination, where the face of the operator become big and can even be a sign of entering a specific state as it is physiological as well psychological as it touches what we call \"dimension\" of an object, that is also a psychological construction. For exemple, a six floors building occupies on the retina the same space as an object near, yet we are able to judge its size, even with an eye closed. There is also a physiological correlate: the more distant the individual' s dark focus, the greater his or her tendency to focus beyond an acuity target and to maximize apparent size. This will create a greater discrimination of detail. In fact judgnents of apparent size are highly correlated with visual accommodation distance, and in aviation it has been proved that the difficulty of detecting airplanes on stationary collision courses is greatly aggravated when focus is trapped by structure close to the eyes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the Mandelbaum effect and how it impacts visual perception during fascination can be useful for pilots and other professionals who rely on accurate visual judgments. By recognizing the physiological and psychological factors at play, individuals can maximize their ability to discriminate detail and avoid potential hazards."
