  "title": "What are the exercises and techniques for mastering polarities and developing inner power?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the topic of developing inner power through exercises that awaken the central fire and enable one to control polarities in humans. It starts by discussing the connection between breathing and the activation of the two cerebral hemispheres. The text then goes on to explain a grounding exercise, followed by exercises for hemispheres and the awakening of the central fire. These exercises improve brain function and open the way for psychic faculties. The last 200 tokens offer exercises that help to connect the \"look\" with the \"watch\" and improve inter-hemispheric coordination. The symbolism of Caduceus is also explored as it relates to the central energy.",
  "content": "2) Re-inhale to the left keeping closed the right nostril 3) Exhale right while closing the left nostril 4) Keep on doing it You can add a particular respiratory rhythm in the exercise above, or run it just as well. Presence to head sides with the two seconds’ rhythm Be aware of the right side of the head, and then of the left one. Continue alternating for a short time. Follow with presence at the front of the head and the back of the head. Continue with the top of the head and the bottom. As you develop a stronger Central, you will feel increasingly centered on you. The rate shall be the following: a second to right and a second to left, repeating for some times, then a second ahead and a second back, repeating for several times too, and similarly for top and bottom. This rhythm according to the researches of Prof. Lefebure improves brain and opens the way to the psychic faculties. In particular the exercise above will enable you to rekindle the \"central fire\" whenever is about to become extinct. Symbolism of Caduceus repeats what was said earlier about the reported Etruscan deity. The two snakes symbolize the side energies, and the Central stick corresponds to the Central energy. Ernest Rossi, \"The mind-body Biology\" Respirazione per dominare le polarità La nostra respirazione, senza che noi ce ne accorgiamo, passa alternativamente da una narice all'altra. Il ricercatore Ernest Rossi[1] ha osservato come questo alternarsi segua dei ritmi specifici e corrisponda al differente attivarsi dei due emisferi cerebrali.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through exercises such as the alternating breathing technique and the near-far glance, as well as techniques involving light and visualization, we can tap into the power of our imagination to enhance our mental abilities, increase awareness, and even improve our health. While these techniques require patience and practice, the potential benefits are worth the effort. By developing our ability to shape mental material, we can achieve a greater sense of control over our thoughts and emotions, and ultimately create a more fulfilling and harmonious reality."
