  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text explores the concept of fascination, which refers to the power of captivating people through the eyes. The author introduces us to Virgilio T., the last custodian of the secrets of this ancient school, who possesses extraordinary power to freeze his subjects with his gaze. The text describes how fascination can be used for therapeutic or self-development purposes, and how it has been transmitted through direct transmission from master to disciple. The author also explores the transformative and scientific nature of fascination and how it can lead to enhanced interpersonal relationships. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of the power of the eye and its potential for astonishing results.",
  "content": "If, however, you do not want to fall into the spell of fascination, you must be extremely cautious, and guard your eyes specifically, as the eyes are largely the only windows of the soul when it comes to love. That is the reason behind the famous saying: “Averte, averte oculos tuos!” 5. Let this instruction suffice for now!” [Giordano Bruno 6]. “Fascination” is the technical term which is used to indicate the capacity of captivating people through the eyes. The image of the Medusa which petrifies by the look is certainly the metaphorical transposition of such a reality. It is the equivalent of the action we were able to notice in Virgilio T., as he literally “turned” his subjects “into statues”. Though it might be deemed strange that merely through the use of the sight it is possible to freeze a person by placing him in a state of “incantation”, the action exercised by this on the brain is given greater intelligibility if we were simply to pay notice to what happens after all to simple animals when they are dazzled by light. They stop dead in their tracks, as if immobilized in a state of astonishment, no longer able to decipher the situation they find themselves in. Mosquitoes go as far as incinerating themselves, a typical feature which is exploited by people in order to spend their summer without suffering too many bites.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of fascination through the eyes is a valuable tool that can be utilized in everyday life, therapeutic settings, and personal growth. However, it is crucial to approach this technique with caution and mindfulness, as it can also lead to negative consequences if not used properly. Training oneself with specific exercises can help develop the eyes' effective strength, panoramic and incisive vision, and achieve firm power over oneself. The eye has always been at the heart of human culture, transmuted into a symbol and a protagonist in metaphors, and the reawakening of the third eye can lead to a significant amplification of consciousness."
