  "title": "What is Donatism, and why is it important to study it in the interest of humanity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author praises M. Donato for his conscientious studies on physiological phenomena. However, the author notes that many viewers doubt the results due to the use of trickery by performers. The author argues that doubt can be philosophical and prudent, but it should be accompanied by proper investigation. Without proper study, even celebrated historians like the one who wrote on Consulate and the Empire, can make erroneous claims. The same mistake led Napoleon to reject steam power without proper examination. In the final part of the text, the author further stresses the importance of careful study and its potential to yield invaluable results in the future.",
  "content": "C’est ainsi que, faute d’une étude suffisante, l’historien célèbre du Consulat et de l’Empire déclarait publiquement que les chemins de fer étaient un joujou incapable de marcher pendant plus de trois lieues sans culbuter; c’est ainsi que Napoléon, au camp de Boulogne, quand il no lui fallait que six heures de liberté sur la mer pour assurer nos dcs:i- nées, put regretter d’avoir rejeté la vapeur sans examen, sans même avoir consulté l’Institut.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial for the progress of humanity to examine the potential of the science of \"donulisme\" and not impede its growth. The multiplication of experiments and the collaboration of all intellects are necessary for its advancement. And for those who doubt, it is easy to be convinced, as many reputable figures have entrusted their children to Mr. Donato, who has demonstrated impressive results, such as making them eat raw potatoes in minutes. The possibilities of magnetic force remain a subject of debate, especially concerning the experiments conducted on Mlle L... and the four closely knit men and their experiences with two chairs."
