  "first_phrase": "This article concludes with valuable advice on how to live a meaningful life, even if it were to end abruptly. It highlights the importance of having a clear purpose in life, which can be challenging to identify, especially for young people. The author stresses the importance of formulating a life plan that is tailored to one's unique nature and potentialities. Furthermore, having an excellent friend can be a great ideal at any stage of one's life. The author invokes an Eastern poet who suggests that one should aim much farther than the target they know they can reach, allowing one's desires to push them as far as they can go. Man should critically assess himself to reduce his defects while highlighting his natural gifts.",
  "content": "“Act in the same way as the archer — an Eastern poet says — who, with his eye, aims much farther than the target he knows he can actually reach, since that will ensure that the arrow, pushed by the force of his desire, is going to fly as far as it can”. Even assuming you are unable to survey your entire life, you should let yourselves project your ideal as far as is possible, and, in addition, you should bring yourselves in touch with your own individuality. The ideal of the artist cannot be the same as that of the farmer, just as the ideal of a maid cannot be identical to a soldier’s 55. Every ideal or “life plan” must be founded, first and foremost, on a full knowledge of one’s own nature and potentialities. It is, in essence, an exteriorization of something which is experienced inside one’s being. Whatever can be demanded from man is that he,— after a detached self-critique —, should take care of trimming down his defects and simultaneously highlighting his peculiar natural gifts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to achieve true success and fulfillment in life, it is crucial to take the time to understand one's own nature and potentialities, and then align them with a vocation or life plan that resonates deep within. By acting in the same way as an archer who aims beyond the target, we can push ourselves to reach our full potential and become reflections of the harmonious balance within the Universe. With organization and dedication to our chosen path, we can multiply our forces and achieve greatness. So, become what you are, trim down your defects, highlight your gifts, and pursue your vocation with passion and purpose."
