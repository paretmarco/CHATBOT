  "title": "What is the concept of I AM and how does it relate to consciousness and ownership?",
  "first_phrase": "In this philosophical text, the concept of \"I AM-I AM NOT\" is explored along with its creation of space and \"my space.\" The question is raised whether consciousness existed before these concepts. Edward affirms consciousness, but when asked if \"I AM-I AM NOT\" belongs to anyone, he falls silent. This leads to a demonstration exploring the archetypical concept of \"I AM\" and the assumptions made about it. In the final 200 tokens, there is a discussion surrounding the definition of \"I AM\" and the assumptions made about reality.",
  "content": "Below is another demonstration to look at theArchetype I Regarding this Archetypical concept called I AM, etc., does it belong to anyone at all? It belongs to itself but not necessarily to anyone in particular. If the Archetypical concept of I AM-I AM NOT is thinned-out, what, if anything, occurs? . . . (Silence.) It feels prior to anything like falling. NOTHING. This is a real. Nisargadatta Maharaj question, \"How did you get the idea that the I AM-I AM NOT was you?\" It was not \"my\" idea. The idea came from \"what\" or \"where?\" It is an idea, and it is NOT. Does the concept of I AM-1 AM NOT have the idea of ownership, location etc.? It's all thoughts. So, it has nothing to do with anything? . (Silence.) Yeah. ________________ DEMONSTRATION #7 THE I AM Define the I AM It is what is and I AM What assumptions have you made about this IS- I AM That the IS is and I AM is what Is.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of I AM-I AM NOT is an idea that belongs to itself, and it has nothing to do with ownership or location. Our assumptions about the I AM can deceive us into believing that we are the I AM, but in reality, the true essence of the I AM is beyond words and thoughts. Ultimately, understanding the I AM requires a deep exploration of our biological desires and the non-verbal aspects of our being."
