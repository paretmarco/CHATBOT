  "title": "How does the seed of the past affect our present perception, and why is context crucial in manifestation?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the importance of understanding and acknowledging the external context when manifesting desires. They explain that solely focusing on one's internal beliefs and ignoring external factors can lead to false assumptions about the connection between wanting and getting. The author also notes that the seed of the past shapes our present experiences and can lead to an Associational Trance of the False Core. The text touches on spiritual and psychological circles' views on inner vs. outer experience and how these perspectives overlook the significance of external context. Therefore, it's essential to consider external factors when manifesting one's desires.",
  "content": "As I said before, if I solved all \"my psychological problems\" and wanted to open a clothing store on a street where there are many other stores, even if my psychology is clear and I'm focused, it might be a total flop. The old saying, \"Do what you love and the money will come,\" demonstrates both the collapsing of the levels and a neglect for the external context. A more accurate saying would be, \"Do what you love and if the external context supports it the money might(?) follow.\" The distortion is, \"If I am clear about it and I want it, then I will get it,\" fuses together \"wanting equals getting,\" as if wanting something had something to do with getting it. It's nice to be clear 73 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness about what you want, but you need to look at the context in which you are trying to manifest this since context is the major component in manifestation.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while having clarity and focus on what you want in life is essential, it is equally important to consider the external context and physical reality. Manifestation is not just about controlling your internal beliefs or thoughts, but rather understanding the context in which you want to manifest your goals. So, do what you love, but be mindful of the external factors and take actions accordingly to increase the chances of success."
