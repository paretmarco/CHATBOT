  "content": "Set yourselves a target purely for your own sake. Mental level: Basic foundations: Be honest and present to your own selves. Do not tolerantly acquiesce, not even for a single moment, in the relinquishment of such a line of action. Creation of the Objective: Define the objective in accordance with the principles we have listed here above (It must be measurable, attainable, etc). Spiritual level: Basic foundations: Learn to access the deepest part of your own selves. Remember also that one can be spiritual while being in a state of material affluence.
