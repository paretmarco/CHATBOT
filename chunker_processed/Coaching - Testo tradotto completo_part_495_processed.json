  "title": "How can dissociation and sensory distortion affect the success of traders in the financial market?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text (not included), the author discusses the importance of focusing on the present moment and executing plans without distraction. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the concept of dissociation in traders who use excessive analytical reasoning to cope with emotional setbacks. Such traders often disengage from reality and fail to act appropriately. The author emphasizes the importance of clear goals and steady action, cautioning against thoughtlessly bold steps that could lead to failure.",
  "content": "You have to delineate your goal in a very clear way, and then, in the event that you taste success, you must continue to act as if nothing had happened, without abandoning yourself, precisely at that stage, to more hazardous initiatives based on your trust in “good luck” or in your belief of “having hit upon the right formula”, since any such more thoughtlessly bold steps would eventually convoy you to the risk of failure. “Dissociation” in traders In the field of psychology, the dissociated person is the one who takes excessive shelter in analytical reasoning as a means for him to live out life. By doing so, he fails to live. This state is often the consequence of events which are emotionally charged. Some traders which have suffered setbacks might adopt this attitude of dissociation by using analogy, and thus run away from their trading activity. These individuals are afraid of trading and take shelter in reasoning. They turn hyper-analytical and know everything about how to do doing things properly, save that they do not jump into action. They essentially disengage themselves from reality, and step into an abstract world of thinking.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, it is crucial to have a clear goal and avoid overreliance on analytical reasoning or avoiding reality. Traders need to take conscious steps to avoid dissociation and sensory distortions to effectively deploy their trading strategies. Remember, success in the field of trading comes from action and not just analytical thinking."
