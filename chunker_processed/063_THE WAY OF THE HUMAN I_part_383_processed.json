  "title": "\"What are the Trances that can arise from a lack of developmental skills in early childhood?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text discusses the hatching period when an infant begins to differentiate themselves from the mother. If the process does not go smoothly, internal trances such as the Prima Donna Complex or Seeing the World Through Mom's Eyes may develop. In the last 200 tokens, the author recalls an encounter with a person who had no boundaries and assigned homework to visualize a picture frame around their husband to start creating clearer boundaries. The text also makes reference to John Lennon's song \"How Do You Sleep at Night?\" to further accentuate the topic of internal trances.",
  "content": "(Mahler, 1968) If, however, the hatching from this symbiotic merging with mom does not go smoothly, other internal trances can arise. TRANCE I: THE PRIMA DONNA COMPLEX Imagining that everything you say, think, do, experience is important and significant is what I call the \"Prima Donna Complex.\" 250 ________________ Special Section This is the child that the parents overindulge. The parent who says, \"What a genius,\" when the child says Da-Da or Ma-Ma. When the child walks, the parents can't believe it's possible. This child begins to think they are so special that they become prima donnas. TRANCE II: SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH MOM'S EYES Imagining others see you the way your mother saw you. OR Imagining you are the way your mother saw you. This reminds me of the song John Lennon wrote to Paul McCartney: \"You lived with straights who told you were king, just like your mama would tell you anything. Those freaks were right when they said you were dead. . . . The one mistake you made was in 3/Our head. . . . How do you sleep at night?\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Prima Donna Complex and Seeing the World Through Mom's Eyes are two internal trances that can arise from a symbiotic merging with mom. These trances can be overcome by learning the developmental skill of moving from inward to outward and back again, which can be likened to Gurdjieff's self-remembering. By splitting our attention inside and outside equally, we can develop multi-dimensional awareness and a more balanced perspective."
