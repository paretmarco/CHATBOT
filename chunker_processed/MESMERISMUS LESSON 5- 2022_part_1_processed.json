The first part of our discussion explores Feynman's background and highlights his major achievements. Now, in the last 200 tokens, we delve into his unique problem-solving strategies, which he called the \"Feynman Technique.\" This technique combines deep understanding, clear communication, and self-reflection to produce effective solutions. We explore the key steps of the Feynman Technique and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.",
