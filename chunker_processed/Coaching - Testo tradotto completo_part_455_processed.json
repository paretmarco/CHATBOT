  "title": "What Are the Essential Elements for Successful Trading in the Financial Markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this book, we delve into the topic of intuitive acumen and its importance in the world of trading. Intuitive acumen is closely linked to tapping into one's inner resources and having the courage to do so. However, before one can develop intuitive acumen, it is important to have clearly defined objectives and to stay focused. In the preceding section, we discussed the importance of setting targeted goals and the ability to think laterally to grasp opportunities. We also highlighted the dangers of trading based on emotions like cupidity, which can lead to taking big risks that exceed our capabilities.",
  "content": "Know how to set yourselves an objective You must set yourselves an objective, which has to be established by recourse to presentification and the demarcation of a specified time frame. It must consist in a direction you are setting out for, as opposed to a continuous tension of the soul. If you were to ask the majority of people investing in the financial markets to expound to you what their goal is, they will usually find it difficult to point it out to you in any exhaustive manner. In their attempt at supplying an explanation, they will trace their whole motivational urge to a simple issue of “earning money quickly and with little effort”. This phrase is born out of an emotion: The emotion of cupidity. Emotions are extremely dangerous to trading. They lead us to hurriedly slip into operations where the likelihood of success works against us and where we invariably take up excessively big risks compared to our true possibilities.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, setting a clear and specific objective with a defined timeline is crucial to successful trading. Avoid being guided by emotions, such as greed, as they can lead to risky behavior and detrimentally impact your investments. Remember, investing is not gambling, so stay disciplined and focused on your goals."
