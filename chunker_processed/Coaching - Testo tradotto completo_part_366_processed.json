  "title": "How can exceptional minds use questions and light to accelerate problem solving?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text segment, we discussed the importance of concentrating on precise questions, reflecting on inspirations, and maintaining focus while waiting for responses to confirm our thoughts. In the last 200 tokens, the author reveals an accelerated or \"modern\" method for achieving the same results, offering the flexibility to be practiced at any time during seminars. The new approach includes using light as an aid, concentrating on what is desired, staring at light for 30 seconds, and then observing the luminous trace with closed eyes.",
  "content": "Turning now to the accelerated or “modern” way, it is essential to emphasize that it is the method we practice more often. It is the same as the preceding one in terms of being structured around the said two moments, save that it will no longer be necessary to be either in the evening or in the morning for us to fulfil their purposes. This accelerated way might accordingly be gone through at any particular time of the day or the night, which explains why it is the version we normally require to be implemented in the course of our seminars. We shall utilize light as a form of aid. We will start by thinking about what we desire (until we succeed, as with the first method described by us earlier, in creating an “accumulation of thought”), and we will move from there to the task of staring at the light for some thirty seconds. As a last step, we are going to shut our eyes without thinking of any thing, staying anchored in the present and limiting ourselves to merely observe the luminous trace in the back of our closed eyes.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the accelerated way of utilizing light as a form of aid to stimulate our quantum mind can be implemented at any time of the day or night. By focusing on what we desire, staring at light for thirty seconds, and observing the luminous trace with closed eyes, we can uncover valid solutions to our problems. According to the modern quantum conception, both the classical and modern methods expand our minds in a non-linear manner, working on the whole rather than separate parts."
