  "first_phrase": "The article discusses how fulfilling biological needs can lead to psychological satisfaction. However, substituting psychological wants for biological needs can result in pain and suffering. The section titled \"Working with Biological Needs\" provides exercises to bring the focus back to biological sensations and avoid substituting psychological wants. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness is the concept that humans need to focus on their biological sensations to reach their full potential. The exercise \"Sexuality\" suggests that individuals should focus on sexual sensations rather than external factors.",
  "content": "Pain arises when, \"I'm tired but I can't go to sleep now, it's too early\" or \"I have to get up to go to work but I'm tired. I force myself to get up.\" Substitution acts as an obsessive compulsive neurotic (self-defeating) drive and this is where the problem is. But when you root it back to biology and body sensation, then you just do what comes next. And if there is no resistance, then there is no issue, and no suffering. WORKING WITH BIOLOGICAL NEEDS The purpose of these exercises is to bring you back to biological sensation and away from the newer brain's image producing. Or better said, back to biological sensation as a vehicle for realization and away from substituting the psychological for the biological. The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness SEXUALITY Focus: Focus your attention on the sexual sensations rather than on the story as to why you feel sexual. (Singh) If you have sexual fantasies and you focus your attention on the sexual fantasy, or on the memory of a person, what happens is that you are always looking outside yourself trying to fulfill the sexual fantasy.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating these exercises into your life can help you reconnect with your body and its biological needs. By focusing on sensations rather than psychological substitutes or fantasies, you can eliminate unnecessary suffering and fully embrace your sexuality. Remember to prioritize your biological needs and well-being, and let go of any self-defeating patterns of thought."
