  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the concept and applications of Quantum PSI, a new technology that explores the fundamentals of human genius and mental achievement based on recent theoretical research. The last 200 tokens cover the model of reality of Quantum PSI and its stratification of consciousness, time, space, energy, and emotional states. The holographic model, presence and consciousness, as well as the techniques and concepts of Quantum Extreme ®, magnetic massage, and Mesmerismus ® are also mentioned throughout the text. The course offers unique and powerful technologies that enable personal and professional success and well-being.",
  "content": "The interference patterns apply to this situation The model of reality of Quantum PSI Quantum Psi observes reality by dividing it into layers. In fact, we live in our own subjective universe. We stratify it on the basis of our experiences and this is what is meant by common sense as existence. Quantum Psi assumes that there is also something before everything: consciousness, that is what we really are. - The deepest layer is the objective state or consciousness: how do we know to exist? Even the Greeks had understood that we are not our thoughts and thinking we exist. Consciousness is a process not computable. - After we have the layer of space-time. Time and space are self-referential structures created by the individual and represent the set of structures that define the world. Their characteristic is that there are not quantum, and transcending them you can access to a level of quantum reality. Within this structure the individual feels the energy flowing in particular direction defining the so-called \"emotional states\". - The energy model of the individual is vectorial, so it has a precise direction and speed. Under this point of view the concept energy can be comparable to the study of a series of flows. These flows can be seen both as waves that as compounds of elements. And for the Heisenberg principle the determination of a dimension, prevent the determination of the other dimensions. So if we experience the flow we will not experience the - The \"emotional states\" define the basic reasons of acting of the individual, and every emotional state exists in a particular time and place.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Quantum PSI model provides a perspective on consciousness as the deepest layer of reality from which space-time emerges. Emotional states and physiological reactions are superimposed until they are measured in a specific context. The course offered uses the latest techniques in NLP, NLP-3, and quantum thinking, including luxmind and quantum coaching, to develop personal and professional skills. The program aims to empower individuals to tap into their vital energy and personal magnetism to achieve success using practical techniques such as hypnosis, coaching, and hypnotic communication. Ultimately, this course offers a unique approach to personal development that integrates cutting-edge research and technology to help individuals achieve their goals."
