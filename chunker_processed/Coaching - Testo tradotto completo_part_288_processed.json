  "title": "\"How can effective praxis and useful rules help change the quality of your life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author provided insight into effective praxis, laying out practical advice for an improved quality of life. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of implementing a daily plan, while considering unexpected events and maximizing energy output. The author also highlights the principle of oscillation, which involves following the mind's rhythms and focusing on activities that best suit the moment. The summary of the text includes three precepts: 1) Do the best thing possible in every moment, 2) Understand the type of activity to maximize efficiency, and 3) Be conscious of time to prioritize work effectively.",
  "content": "Do in every moment the best thing you can do. You ought in each and every moment to do, invariably and prior to any thing else, what might not be done at a different moment. Which of the necessary undertakings best suits this exact moment? II. Understand the “type of activity”. There are some activities which wear out one part of the brain more than others, while a different set of activities has the effect of tiring another part of the brain more. An illustrating example might consist in studying or doing some accounting and keeping ties with other human beings (phone calls, etc). If you alternate these activities, which is actually the method you should adopt, you will always enjoy the maximum level of efficiency. III. Being conscious of time. The watch might dictate the way work is going to be done. If you foresee yourselves having a certain amount of time at your disposal, you should immediately choose to give preference to the work which fits the available time best, the way a certain shoe fits one's feet the most.",
  "last_phrase": "Remember to prioritize and allocate time effectively. Understand what types of activities tire you out and alternate them to maintain efficiency. Be conscious of the time you have and choose the work that fits it best. Always surround yourself with the tools you need and divide the work into manageable units. Do in every moment the best thing you can do, and you’ll find success follows."
