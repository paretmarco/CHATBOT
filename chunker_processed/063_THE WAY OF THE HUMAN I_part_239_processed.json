  "title": "\"What is the significance of the Biological Core in achieving full realization and multi-dimensional awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this piece, the focus shifts to the concept of the biological core, which is key to living a full life. The author meets with a Rolfer, Ron McCombs, who highlights the importance of being connected to one's biological core in order to live fully. The text explains that without this connection, there can be breakages in awareness of the gravitational force, leading to interruptions in psychology, automatic thoughts and feelings, and an inability to experience the nonverbal \"I AM\" at a biological level. It emphasizes that realizing the biological core is necessary for attaining a state of unity consciousness.",
  "content": "There is no interruption of the bipolar connection between the earth and the sun, no breakages in awareness and no psychology. There is just pure biological being and that is realization at a biological level. THE BIOLOGICAL CORE: ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE Recently, I met with Ron McCombs, a Rolfer of some 25-30 years and I asked him, \"What exactly did Ida Rolf mean when she talked about the BIOLOGICAL CORE?\" Ron said there was one sentence he remembered that was important to him. \"The core is what you cannot live fully without.\" The two words that are impor tant to me are live and fully. How can I live fully if I am not aware of and connected to my BIOLOGICAL CORE? Without this connection, I'm going to experience breakages in myself due to breakages in the awareness of the gravitational force. With breakages, and interruptions in my psychology there are automatic thoughts and feelings. I become indecisive and unable to see or \"experience\" the nonverbal I AM at a biological level, not to mention THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. In short, Rolf suggested, if you are not connected to your BIOLOGICAL CORE, then you cannot live fully.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, nurturing our connection to the BIOLOGICAL CORE is not only essential for our well-being but also necessary for us to live fully. By being aware of our biological oneness while acknowledging our separation, we can experience the inter-connection of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and break free from the frozen state of pain and trauma."
