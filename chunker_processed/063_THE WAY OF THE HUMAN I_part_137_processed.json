  "title": "What are Uncooked Seeds in Quantum Psychology and How Does it Relate to Spiritual Gurus?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we learned that meditation helps to eliminate unknown material from our consciousness. In this last part, the author talks about the importance of paying attention to the external world, which is often neglected by spiritual teachings. He mentions the concept of \"uncooked seeds,\" which represent unresolved issues that come up when the external context changes. Awareness, according to the author, is the heat that cooks uncooked seeds, allowing us to process beliefs and concepts so that they no longer sprout. Using the example of a guru, the author explains how external changes can reveal unprocessed psychology. The metaphor of Uncooked Seeds from India is used to explain how awareness can help to cook unprocessed concepts.",
  "content": "As mentioned before, you might be living your life and have everything going well for you. But then you get involved with somebody sexually and all of a sudden the external context changes and all your unresolved issues (uncooked seeds) come up. The best metaphor \"I\" know to describe this phenomenon is from India and it is called Uncooked Seeds. To explain, if I have seeds and I put them in the ground and water them, I will soon get plants which bear fruit But if I first take the seeds, put them in a frying pan and cook them, and then put them in the ground, they won't grow or bear fruit. Awareness is the heat that cooks uncooked seeds (unprocessed) concepts. In this way, Quantum Psychology uses awareness as the stove to cook the uncooked seeds (beliefs, concepts, points of view, etc.,) so that they no longer sprout. Going back to our guru, this is what happens. If they sit alone somewhere in a cave, there is no issue. It's really easy to be pure awareness with your eyes closed while people bring you whatever you need.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to acknowledge and address our unresolved issues or uncooked seeds, especially when getting involved with others sexually or pursuing spiritual paths. Through awareness and cooking these unprocessed concepts, we can prevent them from sprouting and causing unwanted and spiritualized consequences. Remember, self-awareness is crucial in our personal and spiritual growth."
