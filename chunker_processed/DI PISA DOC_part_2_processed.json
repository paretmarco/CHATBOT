  "title": "Who is Prof. Erminio di Pisa and what are his parapsychic exploits and healing techniques?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, we get a glimpse of a mysterious figure who has hypnotized over 250,000 individuals and has been featured in the Italian state-owned media for several years due to his parapsychic abilities. The person lived in Milan, close to Corso Sempione, and was very generous and energetic. He was frequently visited by doctors and therapists, including being called by the San Raffaele Hospital to assist with operations using hypnosis. After getting to know him, the author and their companions were introduced to him and offered lessons in hypnotic techniques, which they found particularly pleasing. This person was known for lavishing gifts on people, including friends and beggars on the street.",
  "content": "He was very often with doctors and therapists who visited him regularly, either because of ties of friendship or due to the fact they were curious about his techniques. He had even been called by the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan to lend help to some operations through the use of hypnosis. That was a truly remarkable acknowledgment, given the ostracism often meted out to practitioners of magnetism and hypnosis within the Italian medical fraternity. A short while after we began to visit him on a regular basis, he started sending us people who were asking him to teach them hypnotic techniques. We found that extremely pleasing, as we had never explicitly demanded such favour from him. We would meet him either in his study or by a seafood restaurant which was not far from his house, and where he invariably offered to pay for our meals, even though we were always at least two visitors if not more. Add to it the fact that, whenever he went to the restaurant, he would hypnotize two or three persons in passing. He was in fact a munificent person who loved lavishing gifts on people. He gave us as present the book “Septenary of Higher Hypnosis”, which in those days was only meant to be read by a small elite. He had gifted some friends of his sharing an interest in esotericism certain talismans which amounted to real jewels cast in gold and precious stones. If he came across a beggar in the street, he would always hand him some generous sums of money.",
  "last_phrase": "Prof. Erminio di Pisa was an exceptional healer, using unique techniques of hypnosis and fascination to treat a range of physical and psychological ailments in a matter of seconds. His techniques were so successful that even doctors and therapists sought his help. He was a generous and charismatic person who loved to share his knowledge and skills with others. His legacy continues through the study of his methods, which can still be used today to help people overcome their problems and achieve a state of balance and harmony in their lives."
