  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the focus is on Kohut's concept of the \"mirror transference,\" where an individual seeks acknowledgement and aggrandizement of their false self from others. This form of narcissistic transference is more mature and directed towards the development of the separate self. The tragedy is that others are used to support the false self, leading to a constant need for confirmation from others. The author has frequently observed this form of narcissism in individuals organizing their external world to support their false self. This concept relates to guru trance and the False Core of \"Worthless.\"",
  "content": "The tragedy, of course, is that others are used to aggrandize the false self. . . . The internal experience of this need for mirroring reduces to a more or less constant need for others to notice, confirm, and bolster the insecure self presented to the world. Narcissists with this level of development often have some insight into their narcissistic character, even though they may not know this pejorative and unfortunate label. (pp. 51-52) I have seen this form of narcissism quite frequently with people who organize their entire external world to support their false self. Here we also see the guru trance and the False Core of \"Worthless\" seeking flattery (see Volume II). For now, it can be said that gurus often allow their personality to be worshiped more than their real SELF (THAT ONE SUBSTANCE). They do this by allowing disciples to \"take on\" the guru's personality, rather than frustrating the disciples' infantile attempts to realize the truth through mimicry, fusion or modeling. This is like a child mirroring the parents' behavior.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the dangers of organizing one's external world solely to support a false self. Narcissists who seek constant mirroring and confirmation may lack insight into their behavior, but it is up to us to be mindful of our own tendencies towards this kind of behavior. True growth and transformation occur when we integrate our learnings into our lives instead of just mimicking or modeling in a superficial way."
