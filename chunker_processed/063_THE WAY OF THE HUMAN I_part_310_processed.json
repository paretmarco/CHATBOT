  "title": "\"What happens when we dissociate from our body and animal nature?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the significance of dissociating from our body and animal nature was discussed, and the harmful impact of spiritual and psychological philosophies that diminish the body was exposed. The chapter concluded with an exercise to help develop the skill to stay in touch with the outer world, the inner psycho-emotional world, and one's animal nature simultaneously. Now, in this last part of the text, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing that all life problems and solutions are viewed through our limited lens, and the need to bear this in mind in seeking help.",
  "content": "But we as individuals and as a society are totally dissociated from this reality In fact, death is the most dissociated reality the biological-psychology faces. That could be why the concept of souls reincarnating came about to defend against this: if I have a soul, I will keep on going, I won't have to face death. Many religions are based on this as well (see The Tao of Chaos). The \"I\" wants to go on, it does not want to die and to defend against death, it makes up stories. Chapter VIII EXERCISE #4 Let your eyes close and divide your awareness in four direc- tions: 1/4 to your animal dimension, 1/4 to your thinking dimension, 1/4 to your emotional dimension, 1/4 to the external dimension. This is a practice that helps to develop the skill to allow you to stay simultaneously in touch with the outer world, the inner psycho-emotional world and your animal nature. In conclusion, we must bear in mind that all life problems and solutions are viewed through your limited lens or the limited lens of the person you go to see for help.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to fully understand and address life problems, we need to recognize the limitations of our individual perspectives and seek guidance from a variety of sources. Developing the skill to stay in touch with our inner and outer worlds is crucial. As we navigate life's challenges, let us remain open to learning and be willing to refer others to the appropriate help they need."
