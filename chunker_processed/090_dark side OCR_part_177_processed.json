  "content": "It is by observing and creating knowingly, that allows the observer/creator to wake-up and get \"in charge\" of the dreaming rather than be a prisoner of the inner child' s trance. Handling Identity Dreams 1. Acknowledge. Watch the mind acknowledge different stories and themes that arise. 2. Notice. Notice, for example, (a) rags to riches: seeing oneself arising from an impoverished position to be- come recognized and acknowledged (Rocky-type movies); (b) Cinderella complex: dreaming someone will materialize and take you \"away from all this\"; (c) seeing self as a football or rock star, or an influential person. Notice the story line; what is usually seen in these identity dreams is a one-dimensional replica of the story. Notice that you are the observer of the inner child's dream. 110 40 The Dark Side of the Inner Child 3. Ask yourself what needs the inner child is trying to fulfill through dreaming.\" Write down your answers. 4. Ask yourself, \"Am I willing to ask for my needs in my present-time relationships?\" Write down your unful- filled needs and whether you are willing to begin to ask for them directly.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by acknowledging, noticing, and understanding our identity dreams, we can take charge of them and use them as a tool for personal growth during times of stress. Through asking ourselves what our inner child's needs are and being willing to ask for them in our present relationships, we can break free from one-dimensional replicas of our stories and become the conscious creators of our dreams."
