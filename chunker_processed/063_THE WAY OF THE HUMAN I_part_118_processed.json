  "title": "\"Can quantum psychology help discover one's true self and overcome fixated awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of collapsing levels of awareness in Quantum Psychology, building upon the initial discussion of the eight dimensions of manifestation and awareness from earlier chapters. The author emphasizes the importance of liberating awareness in order to discover one's true self. However, fixating on any one level of awareness, including the dimension of essence, can lead to problems on other dimensions. The text includes a real-life example of a woman going through a divorce, who was trying to stay in essence while dealing with external problems. The author offers the principle of meeting problems at the level of the problem as a basic Quantum Psychology principle. The text concludes with the principle that what is true at one level of awareness is not necessarily true at another level of awareness. Confusing levels can lead to misunderstanding and pain.",
  "content": "Her husband was angry, abusive and trying to \"steal\" their shared valuables. She said to me, \"I am trying to stay in ESSENCE,\" but I suggested a basic Quantum Psychology Principle: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. In this case, yes, stay in ESSENCE and on an external level, hire a lawyer. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. 65 QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: What is true at one level of awareness is not necessarily true at another level of awareness. To illustrate, because I believe (thinking dimension) I am a great singer or surgeon does not mean I can sing at Lincoln Center or perform surgery at John Hopkins (External Level). The belief that I am a surgeon is a true belief at the thinking dimension, but it is not true in the external dimension. If I experience flying in a dream (Collective Dimension), it does not mean my body can fly. If I am at the level of VOID, it does not mean that there will no longer be feelings at the emotional level. As will be demonstrated, confusing levels can cause misunderstanding and pain.",
  "last_phrase": "If you find yourself in a challenging situation, remember to meet the problem at the level of the problem, as per the Quantum Psychology Principle. Stay true to yourself and maintain your essence, but also consider practical ways to address the external dimension of the issue, such as seeking legal advice if necessary."
