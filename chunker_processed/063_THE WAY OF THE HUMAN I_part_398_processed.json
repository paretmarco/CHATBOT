  "content": "The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The myth of the Minotaur with the head of a bull and the body of a man first appeared in ancient Minoan culture somewhere around 3000 B.C. It should be noted that this male Minotaur has also been depicted as a female by Picasso, Dali and Subraches. The Minotaur myth has existed since before the birth of Christ and 500 years before the birth of the Buddha. Let us begin by telling the actual story of the Minotaur. Afterwards we can explore implications and application for relationships by taking apart each segment of the myth to discern its symbols as well as its powerful message. THE MYTH OF THE MINOTAUR King Minos of Crete invoked the wrath of Poseidon when he failed to sacrifice a magnificent white bull sent to him for that purpose. King minos instead sacrificed a different bull, trying to fool Poseidon. Poseidon's revenge was to cause Phasaphae, King Minos' wife, to fall in love with the animal. In order to attract the bull, Phasaphae asked Daedalus, chief architect at Knossos and all around handyman, to make her a hollow wooden cow structure. When she concealed herself inside, the bull found her irresistible.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the myth of the Minotaur teaches us about the consequences of pride and disrespect for the gods. By examining the symbols and messages within the story, we can gain insight into our own relationships and the importance of ethical conduct. Developing multi-dimensional awareness, as well as following the way of the human, can help us navigate life's complexities with grace and wisdom."
