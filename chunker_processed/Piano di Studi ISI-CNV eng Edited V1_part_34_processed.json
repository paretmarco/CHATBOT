  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text explores the power of personal magnetism and how it can be harnessed to achieve success in one’s personal and professional life. It delves into the techniques used by coaches to develop the skills and potential of their coachees, including the use of hypnotic communication, quantum coaching, and non-verbal communication. The section also discusses NLP-3 and its application to coaching, as well as the importance of avoiding dispersions of mental energy and channelling it in the right direction. The text concludes by offering international certifications in various coaching and hypnotherapy disciplines.",
  "content": "The mere action of looking at someone, without anything further, is charged with meaning. It surely conveys a meaning of interest in such person. In truth, we look more often at the people who interest us or who are to our liking than at the others. Provided the eye is appositely trained, its power will be amplified. Although each person has in himself the peculiar psychological and mental elements which enable him to impact on his fellow human beings, not every one makes use of such elements to the same degree. We use the term \"persuasive fascination\" to denote the practical application of fascination within the context of daily communication. The most glaring and typical manifestation of “personal power\" consists in the art of persuading 1. The person who holds the keys to that art is readily believed in respect of whatever he says, and evinces a form of hegemony over his fellow human beings. In this course we will deal with how to use gaze and non verbal communication to enhance your effectiveness and Charisma. We will also work with the “hypno-selling” system, a method based on words and other elements as NLP-3 aimed at giving you more capacity of persuading other people.",
