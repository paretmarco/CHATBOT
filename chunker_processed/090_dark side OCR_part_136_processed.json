  "title": "\"What is Illusioning and How Does It Manifest in Individuals and Families?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the concluding section of this text, the concepts of illusioning, futurizing, and fantasizing are explored. The author explains how these trances can work together to create powerful illusions that distort reality. They give an example of a woman who believes she has been chosen to become almost like Christ and have thousands of followers. However, this illusion causes her anxiety as she feels unprepared for such a responsibility. The author emphasizes that the remedy for such illusions is to see what is there instead of what is not there. This concept will be further discussed in Chapter 14, Spiritualization.",
  "content": "This concept of the power of thoughts or the power of positive thinking will be dis- cussed in Chapter 14, Spiritualization. To form illusions, the child must shrink her focus of attention to a very small part of total reality, which part becomes magnified and greatly distorted. The remedy for seeing what is not there, is seeing what is there. Illusioning, Futurizing, Fantasizing Often, trances work together to create an illusion. A woman client reported she had been talking with \"beings,\" guides that came to see her. They told her of events in the future, and that she was a chosen person. People would admire her and were waiting for her to become almost like Christ. She was further informed that she would have thousands of followers. These were very strong illu- sions. The problem at this point was she felt very anxious, because she was not ready to become like Christ. The client was reluctant to tell anyone of these illusions for fear she would be thought crazy. As we talked of these beings or guides, she became very young, and I could see in front of me the little girl inside the grown woman.",
  "last_phrase": "It's important to recognize and question our illusions, as they may be formed as a defense mechanism to cope with intolerable situations. By focusing on reality and staying grounded, we can avoid the anxiety and fear that arise from these illusions, and instead focus on personal growth and development. Chapter 14, Spiritualization, will provide further insight on the power of thoughts and how to use them to become our best selves."
