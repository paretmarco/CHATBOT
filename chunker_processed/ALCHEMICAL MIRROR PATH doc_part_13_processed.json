  "title": "What are the stages of consciousness beyond physical perception and how can one achieve them through mirror practices?",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the possibility of reaching higher states of consciousness through a series of mirror exercises. It is divided into four stages, each with its own set of challenges and dangers that one must overcome. The fourth and final stage, \"Beyond the abyss,\" involves identifying with the abyss to overcome fear and cross it. The text also discusses the importance of maintaining presence and developing a sense of self-awareness. The exercises require a combination of willpower and passivity, and strange phenomena can occur during the process. The text highlights the need for caution and gradual development of control in an alchemical context.",
  "content": "The perfect calm comes from the more intense vertigo and it is precisely pushing it to the extreme that, at some moment, you feel the dark abyss opening beneath the feet, and you fall there, until, having acquired full ownership of self and self-focusing on thought, you will note that the feeling of physical reality, body, will gradually diminishing until it disappears almost completely. A greater clarity of concepts will appear. It seems then that the body that has dissolved in a fluidic consistency, while remaining intact in a equal density (the so called alchemical \"mare nostrum\" or \"aqua regia\"), could easily move, traveling in all directions, toward infinity. The identity with the cosmic consciousness is thus manifested. Thus, starting from the experiences of small-scale and seemingly trivial, can the man climb the highest steps of initiation to the supreme mysteries. FIRST CYCLE OF EXERCISES FIRST CHAMBER CLEANING YOURSELF FROM THE INCRUSTATION SATURN PHASE – basic cleaning A1 FIRST EXERCISE Stay in font of the mirror. OBSERVE YOURSELF Arrive to a point where you feel a sensation in yourself A2 SECOND EXERCISE water element As before and arrive to the “swaying phase”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises offer a unique opportunity to explore one's self and reach higher levels of consciousness. By pushing one's boundaries and focusing on the mind-body connection, practitioners can achieve a state of calm and clarity that leads to a greater understanding of cosmic consciousness. Starting with basic mirror exercises, the journey ultimately reaches a point where the practitioner can overcome pain and even achieve astral travel. The seven mirrors tradition offers another path to such self-exploration. These exercises offer a practical guide to achieving deep self-awareness and understanding of one's place in the cosmos."
