  "title": "\"What is the meaning of a divine experience that brings ultimate freedom and inner peace?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This excerpt is from the book \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\" by Carl Jung and Richard Wilhelm. The author describes an experience of transcendent consciousness where they became one with the universe and all reality was concentrated within themselves. This experience removed all vagueness, obscurity, and occultism, leaving only the pure conscious self. Despite being lost and found, the author's root remains intact, allowing for a recreation of the experience.",
  "content": "Quest'esperienza ha cancellato definitivamente quan- to di vago, di indefinito, di occulto restava in me; dal mio mondo sono scomparsi maestri, religioni, aspirazioni, oc- cultismi, riti, amori del prossime) e tutto il resto. Ciò che per un poco mi ha stupito è che la cosa non permane se non la faccio permanere; e cosi la posso ricreare quando è per- duta, perché ne conservo la radice in me.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this experience has allowed the author to remove all vagueness, indefiniteness, and secrecy that once resided within. While this supreme beauty appears when the mind is undisturbed, it is indifferent to all that we hold dear. The sense of freedom and endless peace it provides is found by discovering the rhythm and measure that underlie its harmony, which exists in every aspect of life."
