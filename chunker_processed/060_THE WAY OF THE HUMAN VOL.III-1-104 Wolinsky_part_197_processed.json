  "title": "\"How can meditation on emptiness and void enhance your focus and awareness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter IV, the NOT-I-I exercise takes you beyond the dimensions by meditating on the void, which is just beyond or before the dimensions, according to Vijnana Bhairava and Jaideva Singh. The practice involves utilizing sound to locate the silence or void beyond it. Sink deeply into that space, and then come back to the room. This exercise helps you contemplate the idea that the senses are moved not by your will but by the will of the void or emptiness.",
  "content": "In this, whether you hear a voice, a bird, traffic sounds, find the space at the end of the sound. If you're listening to a sentence in your mind or to an idea, find the VOID at the end of the sound. You're going to drop into that space, that silence, that VOID. Practice: Begin by experiencing the space or the VOID after the occurrence of a sound, of a word, or an idea, or any sound. Use any sound, either \"inside\" or \"outside\" \"yourself,\" and find the space at the end of it. Sink deeply into that space. Whenever you're ready, bring your awareness back to the room; notice your breathing and let your eyes open. Contemplate: That the senses move not by my will or your will, but by the will of the VOID or EMPTINESS. ________________ Chapter IV \"I'd\" like you to contemplate the five senses. Senses are moved not by your own personal will but by the the VOID or EMPTINESS. For example, if your eyes move a certain way, it's the VOID.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding that the senses are moved by the will of the VOID or EMPTINESS, we can cultivate a sense of presence and surrender to the flow of life. By practicing dropping into the space at the end of each sound, we can access that silence and deepen our contemplation of this truth. Remember, you are not living a life, but being lived by the VOID. Allow it to flow through you."
