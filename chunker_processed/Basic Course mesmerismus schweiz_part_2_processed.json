  "title": "\"What Will You Learn in the Level One Swiss Version Course on Animal Magnetism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text provides a summary of the last 200 tokens of a six-day introductory course on Swiss magnetism. The course covers a range of basic exercises such as magnetic passes, catalepsy, and regression, and progresses to more advanced techniques like distant magnetism and the Campanelli technique for stopping smoking. The final day includes an explanation of the next course, as well as a self-magnetism exercise and a magnetic massage. The text includes mentions of different demo crisis and methods such as the Ghigi Paret and Lafontaine methods.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this intensive six-day course in basic exercises and techniques of magnetic passes, catalepsy, regression, and other aspects of animal magnetism provides an excellent foundation for those interested in exploring this field further. Through a combination of theory and hands-on practice, participants gained a deeper understanding of the power of magnetism in healing, induction, and crisis management, among other applications. With the techniques learned in this course, readers can now confidently begin their journey towards harnessing the power of magnetism for personal and clinical use."
