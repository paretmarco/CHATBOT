  "title": "\"How can traders develop informed instinct through distinct experiences and reference points?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author emphasized the importance of accumulating effective experience for developing a trader’s intuition. In this final part, the author refers to Malcolm Gladwell’s concept of an “informed instinct” and draws an analogy with football. A successful trader needs to distinguish between different plans of action and see them as distinct processes. The experiences serve as reference for the de-coherence which might occur. The final outcome is an informed instinct, a sophisticated judgment that enables scoring a goal.",
  "content": "At the start of his career, a manager must rely instead on the experts in management theory, precisely like the trader has to lean on the advices of the more experienced traders and on available trading systems. In order to score a goal in this world, we should base ourselves on our instinct, exactly as it is done by football champions. In his last book \"Blink\", Gladwell puts forward the view that the best choices are those which are made in the \"blink of an eye\". The blink manager is a person who has witnessed many things and who has learnt a lot, to the point where he has educated his unconscious to follow his instinct. A good analogy is the one that might be drawn with football: A successful player does not consciously think of the decisions he needs to take in order to put the ball at the back of the net. He scoops from years of experience which have empowered him to hone his skills of judgment, until his judgment has become exceptionally sophisticated: The final outcome of that is scoring a goal.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, whether you are a manager or a trader, having faith in your instinct is crucial to success. Drawing parallels to football champions, Gladwell's Blink, and quantum theory, we can optimize our intuitive acumen through experience and gathering information. By educating our unconscious and honing our judgment, we can make quick and sophisticated decisions that lead to scoring goals in our respective fields."
