  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explains the purpose of Quantum Psychology and distinguishes it from other forms of psychology. Rather than making individuals \"better\" or fixing their issues, its purpose is to discover who you truly are. The last 200 tokens discuss the connection between Nisargadatta Maharaj and Quantum Psychology, and how the Advaita Vedanta path of unlearning is central to the process. The author highlights that the process is organized through internal questioning and enquiry, leading to a liberation of awareness until the enquirer-enquiree and awareness disappear. The text provides insights into Quantum Psychology and its core premises.",
  "content": "While he was alive, only one of his books was published, called I Am That. This was his most impor- 16 Chapter tant work. He was into Advaita Vedanta (Advaita Sanskrit for non-duality) and Jnana yogi (Sanskrit for knowledge, the path of knowledge), but actually it is the PATH OF UNLEARNING. Advaita contends that there is only ONE SUBSTANCE, that everything is made of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, not two or more substances, and that is all spirituality really is, and YOU ARE THAT ONE SUBSTANCE (Volume III). Because of Quantum Psychology's relationship to Nisargadatta Maharaj, it is directed toward enquiry and dismantling, not fixing, transforming or healing, the False Core-False Self's psychology. The process is organized through internal questioning and enquiry. In Quantum Psychology, we want to reduce the amount of awareness placed on, and consumed by, \"your\" psychology, in this way liberating your awareness until the enquirer-enquiree and awareness itself disappear in the non-dimensionality of the underlying unity of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE, Quantum Psychology is an extension and continuation of Nisargadatta Maharaj—i.e., Advaita Vedanta—and it has several premises which form its basic core.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology, based on the principles of Nisargadatta Maharaj's Advaita Vedanta and Jnana yogi, emphasizes the process of internal questioning and dismantling to liberate awareness and realize the underlying unity of the ONE SUBSTANCE. By reducing focus on the False Core-False Self's psychology and the enquirer-enquiree, we can dissolve into non-dimensionality to attain true spiritual awakening."
