  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the idea of being the master of yourself and recovering your true self by relinquishing uncontrolled thoughts. In the last 200 tokens, the author focuses on practical strategies to achieve self-mastery in communication and actions. The author advises setting a target, being mindful of what we say, and avoiding aimless reactions. To illustrate this point, the author looks at the history of successful people who exuded self-mastery and coordination. The author stresses the importance of coherence in thought, communication, and action to project a clear image of oneself.",
  "content": "Lastly, if a conversation requires some kind of concatenation, one must always be careful not to reply too automatically. When you give expression to an idea, you ought to ponder the meaning of every word, and to avoid using more words than those needed to asseverate that idea 13. If we throw a glance at history, we will find that though successful people used to keep their acting well-focused, they always exerted a strong impression on the environments around them. As with an image drawn against a white background, their acting and being always seemed to be clear and with neat contours. We in fact perceive as \"magnetic\" a person whose way of acting is confident and coordinated, and who evinces self-mastery. These attributes of “self-conviction” have a tendency to coincide with the fact that the person we are facing expresses himself in a self-consistent manner at all levels of communication and throughout the different areas of his mind. Accordingly, he thinks only of one thing, motions the eyes and the hands in a harmoniously consistent fashion, and exudes self-coherence in every one of his acts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing self-conviction and a captivating gaze can greatly improve one's impact on others. By practicing mental focusing exercises like fixing your gaze on a specific point without blinking, you can strengthen your visual system and become more confident and coordinated in your actions. Always remember to avoid using unnecessary words and ponder the meaning of every word when expressing yourself in any conversation."
