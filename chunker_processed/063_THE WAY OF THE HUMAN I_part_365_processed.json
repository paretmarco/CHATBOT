  "title": "\"What is the impact of the symbiotic character's need for merging on their autonomy and relationships?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the symbiotic character's internal conflict of choosing between autonomy and contact. The individual's desire for a blissful merger constitutes the libidinal self, which develops through the relationship between an infant and their mother. Meanwhile, the antilibidinal self is constructed through repeated blocking of separation, resulting in an idealized merger-object. Additionally, the text highlights the developmental arrest that occurs when living in this state, leading to a dependent role-relationship model. In the final 200 tokens, the text focuses on the mother's role as a guru and a transformational figure, causing individuals to seek transformation outside of themselves.",
  "content": "(p. 158) In other words, the proper self-other relationship in this model is one in which I give myself up and over to you to obtain the bliss of merger. It is also important to note that there is developmental arrest in this state and role-relationship model, such that the individual feels herself to be dependent, in need of supplies, and in need of an all-gratifying caretaker as would a small child. In this repressed state, the individual experiences these archaic feelings irrespective of the degree of adult autonomy she may have really attained. (p. 159) Here again Johnson points to the causes of the re-enactment of the merger trance-ference with therapists, teachers and gurus. EVEN MORE SPIRITUALIZED: THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MOTHER THE MOTHER AS GURU There is no question that developmental research demonstrates the overwhelming influence of the relationship between infant and mother. More interesting is how unresolved issues within this most basic area of our lives result in the over-seeking for transformation outside of ourselves rather than inside. The child sees the mother as a transformational figure, meeting needs, handling hunger, cold, or loneliness.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is vital to recognize that unresolved issues in the relationship between infant and mother can lead to a constant search for transformation outside of oneself. Understanding how the unconscious longing for a transformational mother can be projected onto therapists, gurus or psycho-spiritual systems can encourage individuals to work towards resolving these issues internally, rather than seeking external solutions."
