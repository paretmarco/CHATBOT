  "title": "\"Can Allowing Emotions to Be Without Judgment Allow for Transmutation of Energy? A Look into Quantum Psychology Practices\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text focuses on transmutation and how working with the emotional dimension allows for the transmutation of all experiences to be experienced as energy. The author highlights that if one tries to get rid of feelings, a judgment is placed upon them, hence resisting them, and preventing the transmutation process. The concept of transmutation is explored in relation to quantum psychology, and the practice of placing attention on the emotion comes from one of the major texts in Kashmir Shaivism known as Vijnana Bhairava. This last part explores how to allow for the transmutation of all experiences to free our awareness and become more aware of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS.",
  "content": "to be as they are, namely energy, the \"experience\" transmutes (reorganizes) itself. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If you are trying to get rid of feelings you place a judgment, evaluation, and significance placed upon them and are resisting them. It should be noted that the experience of \"pure energy\" is much closer to the quantum level because energy is an \"earlier\" manifestation of the condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS than are the labels anger, sadness, joy, etc. Descriptions, stories, beliefs about what experiences \"mean\" take us further away from the quantum level (to be discussed later). The purpose of the following practices is to help you to allow for the transmutation of all your experiences so that thinking and emotional energies tied-up and collapsed can be experienced as energy. In this way you will free your awareness and become more aware of the quantum level or VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. The basic idea of placing your attention on the emotion comes from the Vijnana Bhairava, which is one of the major texts in Kashmir Shaivism. It contains dharanas (how to affixate awareness), which are Tantric practices.'",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by allowing for the transmutation of all experiences into pure energy, we can free our awareness and become more conscious of the quantum level of undifferentiated consciousness. By placing our attention on emotions through dharanas, we can fixate our attention by choice and expand our knowledge. In Quantum Psychology, symptoms can be the cure if we understand that the \"problem\" is our habitual fixation of attention."
