  "title": "How can Tantric meditation help shift focus from sexual fantasies to internal energy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this part, the author delves deeper into Tantric meditation and how it can connect an individual to their humanness. The author recollects a profound lesson from Babaji that there is only one chakra, that being energy. The difference between Tantric meditation and others is its focus on the present moment and fueling oneself to connect more with their true self. A practical exercise involves shifting attention from sexual fantasies and labels to energy itself.",
  "content": "So it's all energy, only the mind compartmentalizes it into higher and lower chakras, placing judgments, evaluations and giving significance to the labels. The difference and beauty of Tantric meditation is that it is for people who live in the world. Rather than trying to put your mind someplace else, in Tantric meditation you're always focusing on what is. In this way feelings and thoughts are used as fuel to bring you into a deeper connection with yourself and your humanness. Practice: Close your eyes and get yourself comfortable. Develop a sexual fantasy. You can start by picking someone that you'd like to be with. Notice what they look like, whether there are any sounds. Watch the sexual fantasy. Notice the temperature, notice if there are any smells or any tastes, any sensations. Let the movie in your mind run for a moment. Gently, shift your attention from the sexual fantasy to the energy in your body itself. Begin by noticing where in your body you feel that energy, where those sensations and feelings are. Take off the label of sexual feelings or sensations and have it as energy. Focus your attention on the energy itself.",
  "last_phrase": "By practicing Tantric meditation, you can learn to see your thoughts and feelings as made of energy. This allows you to deeply connect with yourself and your humanness, without judgments or evaluations. So, next time you have a sexual fantasy, try shifting your attention from the story to the energy in your body, and simply observe it. This practice can help you cultivate a deeper awareness and acceptance of yourself."
