  "title": "\"How can fixation on False Self concept hinder Multi-Dimensional Awareness in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore why awareness of ESSENCE, I AM and other dimensions are often unknown to us. The author explains that if our awareness is fixated on negative thoughts and emotions, then there is no space for awareness to be aware of ESSENCE, I AM, etc. and consciousness becomes limited in that dimension. However, the author suggests that when your awareness is freed up, ESSENCE, I AM, and \"NOT-I-I\" emerge naturally. The text warns against spiritual practices that offer temporary highs as transcending something requires experiencing and acknowledging it. Enlightenment isn't about guarding or isolating oneself.",
  "content": "When your Awareness is freed up, then ESSENCE, I AM, \"NOT-I-I,\" etc. emerge naturally. You can't work *As will be discussed in Volume HI, all spiritual practise requires an Ito do it. 23 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness In Quantum Psychology you cannot transcend anything if you are unwilling to experience and acknowledge it. For this reason we spell transcend, Trance-end, the ending of trances. Transcendence by mantra, yantra or tantra is temporary; it is a temporary \"high\" or \"hit.\" Somebody can achieve it for a short while if they are secluded in a retreat, workshop or Ashram. But put them on the job or in a relationship and the \"uncooked seeds\" (to be discussed later) sprout again. This is because each new or different external context brings up \"different\" uncooked seeds. If your awareness of ESSENCE, I AM, etc. has to be guarded (by rules and shoulds), protected (by not associating or associating only with certain people) or by isolation (retreats, Ashram, etc. ), this is not Enlightenment.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, true enlightenment is not a fixed state or something that can be achieved through temporary practices, but rather a fluid and ever-evolving awareness of one's true essence. When this awareness is freed, it emerges naturally and doesn't require guarding, protecting, or isolation. The key is to acknowledge and experience one's true self fully, even in challenging external contexts. As Nisargadatta Maharaj would ask, \"What do you care what state you are in? I am not in a state.\""
