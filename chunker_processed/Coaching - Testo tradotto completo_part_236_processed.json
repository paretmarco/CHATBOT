  "title": "How important is physical health for success and fulfillment in life?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the importance of physical health and vitality in achieving success and fulfilling personal goals. The author emphasizes that without taking care of our physical bodies, we cannot tap into our full potential. The concept of the \"fractal\" is used to illustrate how our various spheres of life, such as work, relationships, and cultural interests, interconnect with each other. Voltaire's approach of \"making up his body\" is also mentioned as a way to prepare for intellectual efforts. Named concepts include \"fractal\" and \"health and vitality,\" and the author also mentions Voltaire.",
  "content": "Health and vigour are the indispensable prerequisite of every activity, be it intellectual or moral. It is only physical wellbeing which allows us to dispose of our time, as the latter is the unifying thread which life is made of. Health lies at the basis of energy, and this is, accordingly, the element we ought to focus upon. What we mean by state of health is a state which allows us to have ardent desires, that is, to direct ourselves, with covetous passion, towards that point where we become able to release our surplus energy. Health as something to contemplate, as a goal in itself, cannot represent manâ€™s ideal. Many gymnastic exercises are useful in this connection, as they are specifically devoted to the arms and the legs. Most of the exercises, however, should set about to accomplish the two following aims: 1. Straightening the back (inasmuch as the spinal column is related to nervous functions, connecting functions, that is); 2. Bringing down the abdomen and strengthening it (as it performs functions relating to nourishing the body and balancing it) 58.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, health and vitality are crucial for optimal productivity and the expression of our thoughts in reality. Straightening the back and strengthening the abdomen through exercises are pivotal in achieving physiological harmony between the cerebrospinal and sympathetic nerve systems. A healthy body allows us to release our surplus energy and pursue our ardent desires, thereby allowing us to make the most of our time."
