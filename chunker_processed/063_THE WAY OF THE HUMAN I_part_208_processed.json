  "title": "\"How does meeting biological needs lead to satisfaction in Quantum Psychology?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the concept of substituting psychological wants for a biological need was discussed, resulting in pain and no satisfaction. This leads to the necessity of meeting the biological need first, which includes the merger response (desire to merge) and the learning response (drive to learn). Thwarting either response results in biological deprivation. The fourth dimension - the body, encompasses our animal nature - eating, sleeping, shitting, sexuality, libido, and learning. This section emphasizes the importance of not losing awareness of our physical body and meeting our biological needs first.",
  "content": "QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Substituting a \"psychological want\" for a biological need yields an obsessive-compulsive action, desire and reaction and no satisfaction. 127 The Way of the Human 4. Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Quantum Psychology says that there are two other major biological have-to 's: (1) the merger response, i.e., the biological desire to merge at one of the dimensions; and (2) the learning response, i.e., at a biological level, a drive to learn at greater and greater levels of differentiation and complexity. As with the other four biological drives, any thwarting of the merger or learning response yields a biological deprivation and shock. The fourth dimension of manifestation is the body. Our body comprises our animal nature eating, sleeping, shitting, sexuality, libido (the desire to merge)â€”and learning at greater levels of complexity. Often we lose awareness of our physical body. For example, in a workshop, I once met a woman who was not in her body. She was not around her body. She was not even aware of what she was saying.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Quantum Psychology emphasizes that substituting psychological wants for biological needs leads to obsessive-compulsive actions without satisfaction. Additionally, the merger and learning responses are essential biological drives that require attention to avoid deprivation and shock. Loss of awareness of the body corresponds to dissociation from one's dimensions and the external world. Hence, we must prioritize gaining awareness of ourselves to achieve stabilization in our underlying unity and live a fulfilling life."
