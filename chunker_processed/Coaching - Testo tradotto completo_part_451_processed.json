  "title": "How Can Traders Manage Emotionalism and Overcoming Difficulties in Financial Markets?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the concept of emotional management in trading is explored. While \"automatic\" trading methods can help to reduce the impact of emotions, sometimes the 1% of choices made using the head are what really lead to success. The meaning of \"using one's head well\" is discussed in the context of trading, where independent traders must face a global competitive landscape.",
  "content": "However, directly watching our money moving around in the market might cause our emotional side to achieve dominance upon all the rest, thereby giving rise to serious problems. What is it that should then be done so as to properly manage emotionalism? Some “automatic” methods are available in the market. Using a particular trading method means to determine in advance when, in which way, and how much capital might be risked in the particular operation concerned. That way, emotionalism will certainly have a lessened impact. The utilization of automatic methodologies, however, is not enough on its own. The truth, in fact, is that oftentimes it is not the 99% of those operations we carry out automatically which really cause us to earn, but rather the 1% of choices we make BY USING THE HEAD. What is, however, the meaning of “using one's head well”? The trader is a sole owner, who operates fully independently from anyone else, and yet he has to face the whole world. At present, because of Internet, competition has become global.",
  "last_phrase": "To properly manage emotionalism in trading, utilizing automatic trading methodologies is a helpful step. However, it's important to remember that the choices made by using one's head well are the ones that truly lead to earnings. Facing global competition and the emergence of principles of natural selection, overtrading must also be avoided to prevent stress."
