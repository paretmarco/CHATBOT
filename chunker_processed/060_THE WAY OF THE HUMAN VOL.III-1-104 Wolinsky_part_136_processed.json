  "title": "What are Archetypes and their relation to the Void and Consciousness in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In this article, the author explores the concept of Archetypes in Quantum Psychology. They explain how Archetypes are formed by the contraction of the VOID of undifferentiated consciousness and how each Archetypical story or myth is created by the contraction of the Physics Dimensions. They mention Nisargadatta Maharaj, who called the primary Archetype I AM, and Jung who studied Archetypes as patterns. The text also describes how Archetypical distortions are not true Archetypes and are instead created by the nervous system to organize chaos. The final 200 tokens discuss the idea that there is no \"you\" creating Archetypes or making choices, but rather an expansion and contraction of consciousness.",
  "content": "ARCHETYPICAL DISTORTIONS NOT TRUE ARCHETYPES Quantum Psychology defines unreal Archetypes as follows: Untrue Archetype: 1) Dissociated and Substituted Resisted Experiences What this means is that rather than the Archetype manifesting \"you\" through a direct condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, which is from the top (VOID) down to \"You\"—THE VOID-4COLLECTIVE----> ARCHETYPES--*\"YOU\" which is a real archetype—\"you\" (your nervous system) create' the concept of an archetype to organize chaos. This archetype appears as universal but since it actually is a form of resistance, it is even more condensed VOID. For example, if Mom is mean and the you cannot handle what is happening, you dissociate. In the dissociative state, a wicked witch Archetype might be created by your nervous system. But this is not a true Archetype. A true Archetype is a condensation of the VOID (top) which becomes the col- 'It should be noted that ultimately there is no YOU which creates, there is only the expansion and contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS in which a \"you\" appears and then imagines it creates or has volition, preferences. or choices.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the difference between unreal archetypes and true archetypes is crucial in Quantum Psychology. Dissociated and substituted resisted experiences and developmental archetypical distortions cause unreal archetypes. True archetypes are a direct condensation of the VOID of undifferentiated consciousness, forming the collective unconscious from the top down. Ultimately, only the expansion and contraction of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS exists, and true archetypes are a manifestation of that."
