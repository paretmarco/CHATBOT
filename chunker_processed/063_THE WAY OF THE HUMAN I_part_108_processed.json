  "title": "\"Why is Quantum Psychology the Answer to the Question: Who Am I?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of \"The Way of the Human\" Chapter III, entitled \"Why Quantum Psychology?\", author Stephen explores the historical evolution of psychology and its shift from the search for the self to problem resolution. He traces the origins of psychology from man's search for self-awareness and the emergence of religions and spiritual systems. He also discusses the advent of psychoanalysis via Sigmund Freud, which led to the exploration and treatment of problem states. Throughout the years, the focus has been on diagnosis and problem-solving, rather than on an exploration of our complete nature.",
  "content": "Hence, the more subtle search for who we are and our complete nature took a back seat. For many years the exploration of problem states and, of course, problem resolution have been in the driver's seat. Our search became limited to diagnosis and the treatment of problems. How do we cope with and solve the dilemmas of life? In a real sense, the industrial revolution and technology could be seen as having dehumanized people, asking people to behave as The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness machines. Historically, as you trace the industrial revolution, you can see how it played a major role. For example, as Europe became more industrialized, philosophy whose focus was \"Who Am I?\" shifted to psychology's focus of, \"How can I survive, cope and handle today's problems and conflicts?\" The question, \"Who Am I? What is my nature?\" was abandoned and in its place came \"How can I cope?\" \"How can I survive?\" And when someone could not fit into the fast-paced industrial world, rather than asking what was wrong with the system, it became \"What is wrong with me?\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is crucial that we do not lose sight of our humanity in the pursuit of progress. While problem-solving and coping mechanisms are important, we must also make room for the more profound exploration of our complete nature and ask ourselves, \"Who am I?\" The dehumanization of modern society through technology and materialism has led us down a dangerous path, and it is up to us to prioritize our connection to each other, rather than machines or possessions."
