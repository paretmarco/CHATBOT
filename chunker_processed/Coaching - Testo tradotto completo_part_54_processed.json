  "title": "\"How can we transcend our limited ego and develop personal magnetism for a more fulfilling life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the focus is on transcending the limited ego, which is born from fears, to gain access to a broader level of the mind where the source of all energies is located. This idea of developing a more complete state is introduced in the previous part, which discusses how to acquire control over one's own life and develop personal magnetism. By observing oneself without interference from the mental or emotional levels, we can achieve fulfillment and allow our consciousness to be the true master of our inward.",
  "content": "How many things do we carry out within a day which, were we to view them at the end of that day, are utterly useless? Since we first wake up in the morning, our mind is set in motion, and hundreds of emotions and reflective thoughts cross our mind. Are they all useful? With four or five well-targeted actions per day, most people might be more successful than what they are at present. The uppermost level consists in “watching oneself act” without any interferences from a mental or emotional level operating at a furiously maddening pace. In order to attain that goal, we are obliged to assume control over our own attention. The human being who tastes fulfilment acts in a clear way: His thoughts move in one and the same direction, and the software of his mind software is at his service as opposed to being the guide in charge of him. He knows what he wants. His consciousness (understood in the sense of consciousness of his essential being) is the true master of his inward.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, taking control of our attention and focusing on well-targeted actions can lead to a more successful and fulfilling life. It's worth reflecting on how many useless activities we carry out in a day and redirecting our energy towards what truly matters. While some individuals can achieve success through pathological means, true personal magnetism comes from being in harmonious agreement with our true selves."
