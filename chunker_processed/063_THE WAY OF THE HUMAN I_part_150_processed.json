  "title": "How can you overcome limitations in life by understanding the nature of thoughts and identifying with them?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the nature of the mind and how identifying with our thoughts can limit us. The author argues that since the mind is always changing, we cannot rely on our thoughts. The text ends with a story of a couple who paired up to ask each other, \"From where does that thought arise?\" in order to break free from identifying themselves with their thoughts. The author encourages readers to do the same, and to notice who is the knower of their thoughts.",
  "content": "The couple had paired up with one another, asking each other, \"From where does that thought arise?\" The woman stopped her inquiring, looked at me, and said \"I'm trying to think of something to sayâ€”I'm always trying to think of something to say.\" I replied, \"That's the story of your life,\" and she answered, \"Yes.\" That thought \"I should say something\" wont by and she identified it as herself. She would then run all her trips about how and why she never knew what she should say. So as thoughts arise, keep asking yourself, \"From where does that thought arise'?\" If there is a thought called \"I'm afraid,\" you identified with it and feel like \"That's me.\" Then suddenly your mind said, \"I'm afraid because I don't have enough money.\" \"I'm fearful because my relationship is screwed up,\" \"I afraid because (fill in the blank).\"",
  "last_phrase": "Remember, you are not your thoughts. So, the next time you experience a thought, ask yourself \"From where does that thought arise?\" and avoid identifying yourself with it. Don't let your mind give you a thousand reasons to justify the feeling associated with it. Instead, practice Jnana Yoga and break free from false conclusions and solutions that only create more problems."
