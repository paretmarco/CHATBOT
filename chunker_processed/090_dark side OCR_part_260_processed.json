  "title": "How Does Futurizing and Triggering Contribute Towards Anxiety and Catastrophizing?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author delved into the concept of \"futurizing\" anxiety and its effects on the inner-child identity. In the final 200 tokens, the author discusses how triggers can lead to a rejection trance, using a personal example of a previous traumatic experience with policemen. Furthermore, the author uses a case study to explore how a man's trigger - the way the woman touches him - created a catastrophizing and fear trance regarding his romantic relationship with her. By breaking down the trigger into smaller pieces, the author hopes to help the man differentiate the trigger, leading to a better understanding of his anxiety.",
  "content": "I am already experiencing anxiety and tightness in my muscles. The policeman is the trigger. This trance is triggered by police and is from the past experience of having five policeman beat me up in the 1960s during an anti- Vietnam war demonstration. The stuck part of myself overlays the incident of the 1960s on the 1990s and, thus, creates a catastrophizing and fear trance. In my case, as with the others, there was no differentiation. I asked this man, \"What exactly is the trigger?\" He said, \"Well, she hugs me. When she sees me she goes like this: she taps me on the back or puts an arm around me. I can tell that it' s becoming more of a friendly relationship than a lover relationship.\" The hand and touch are what triggers the response. To him that says she is being friendly rather than sexual. My task is to differentiate the trigger (to make into smaller pieces). I asked, \"Which finger feels most friendly?\" He said, \"The middle finger.\" The trigger is the way she touches him.",
  "last_phrase": "To overcome a triggering response, it's important to differentiate the trigger into smaller pieces. By analyzing the trigger, new meanings can be associated with it. In this case, it was discovered that the middle finger was an indicator of friendliness, while the index finger was related to sexuality. By recognizing and interpreting these variations, it's possible to mitigate the response and move forward with a greater sense of control."
