  "first_phrase": "In this part of the text, we delve deeper into the process of developing intuition in trading. The author emphasizes that the solution lies within oneself, and that a trader must invest in their own self-development. The process involves gathering information from various sources, organizing it, changing one's state of attention, and having a clear idea of what is required. The gathered information must meet a precise criterion of being kept distinct, enabling the analysis and distinction of different plans of action. Other experiences are used as reference points to interpret experiences and unleash specific reactions. This is the first step in creating an \"informed instinct.\" The author cites Malcolm Gladwell's ideas about informed instinctive judgment.",
  "content": "Having a clear idea of what we require SOME RULES AIMED AT ACCUMULATING EFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING AS AN UNDERPINNING PROP OF INTUITION The information we gather must in fact meet a very exact criterion, namely: The elements must be kept DISTINCT. What this essentially signify is that the trader ought to be able to analyze and distinguish between the different plans of action, and to see and feel them as distinct \"processes‚Äù. Technically, there must be at least a situation wherein each of these elements might be separately identified in a certain manner. Other experiences are used as \"attracting forces\" for the sake of interpreting the experience and unleashing specific reactions. These experiences serve as reference for the de-coherence which might occur. This is the first step in the process of creating an \"informed instinct\". An analogous concept has been recently articulated by Malcolm Gladwell, the author of \"Tipping Point\", a last generation best-seller on marketing. These are his words: \"I give praises to the informed instinctive judgment, not to the uninformed instinct \".",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, for traders to develop an \"informed instinct,\" they must follow a set of rules aimed at accumulating effective experiences. These experiences must meet an exact criterion, and elements must be kept distinct to analyze and distinguish different courses of action. Using experiences as a reference can help de-coherence and unleash specific reactions, leading to the creation of informed instinct. As Malcolm Gladwell explains in \"Blink,\" relying on instinct is crucial to success, and it can only be achieved through experience and education of the unconscious mind."
