  "content": "NLP has been active in Italy since the beginning of the 80s; it has developed models and interventions used in companies, schools, training centers, and is also used by therapists. In the last few years, it has experienced a growth in new models and paradigms, which brings us to the subject of NLP 3, signifying a consistent approach and evolving itself further than its predecessors in the research for new horizons. Our institute is internationally recognized as being among those that facilitate such a venture. What Does NLP Mean? Literally, NLP stands for Neuro-linguistic Programming. By breaking the name up we can individualize 3 main components. Neuro: Our experience is filtered and processed by our central nervous system through the five senses. Linguistic: This is the response to internally received or surfacing stimuli, therefore, starting the verbal and non-verbal relationships with the external. Programming: It means the mental effort that starts within the individual at the moment in which he receives information. It is, therefore, evident that by perceiving the world using the five senses, each person perceives and processes things in a different way. Once all the information is gathered, an internal procedure of mental processing is activated that is composed of mental representations of that which is perceived. These mental representations influence values and convictions which, at the same time, trigger an internal state, structured by emotions, feelings and sensations that form mental programs (metaprograms) or strategies of people still under the form of mental representations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP has been an important subject of study and practice in Italy since the 80s, with continuous growth and evolution in recent years. It offers a unique approach to understanding and optimizing human behavior, communication, and relationships. Through the study of NLP, we can learn successful strategies modeled from those who have achieved great successes in their lives. We can also learn techniques such as instant rapport and non-verbal communication, which can greatly enhance our ability to connect with others. By adopting a positive attitude and willingness to learn, NLP can help us achieve our dreams and improve our overall quality of life."
