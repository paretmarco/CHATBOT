  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author relates the concept of the biological level, which is the most primitive form of linear brain and the energy that emanates from it. This level plays a significant role in the process of fascination and draws out the maximum possible extent of resources in individuals. The last 200 tokens focus on the relevance of presencing tactics in financial trading and how important it is to exercise control over emotions. The text explains the necessity of practicing discipline and reducing every action to its objective essence. The author uses an illustrating example of finding oneself at the edge of a cliff on a mountain track to highlight the importance of being present in trading.",
  "content": "Life is a system within which you operate, and where you can win a lot just as well as lose everything. Plentiful individuals run through their existence as if in a trance, without realizing the opportunities which life dishes out, and which accrue in favour of those who know how to keep a state of indifference. As for the those people who let themselves be ridden by emotion, the trading they engage in is emotional and lacks concrete substance. If you want to engage in trading, learn not to fear anything and not to desire anything at an emotional level. This is what we call “presence in the trading” This rule necessitates discipline. It can be started within the physiological context. After you have learnt the method of curbing external manifestations of emotion, you should study how to launch your assault against emotion right inside its very essence. What is therefore required is to get used to strip every action and every fact of its turbid emotional dregs, by reducing it to its pristine objective essence. This technique can easily be explained by resorting to an illustrating example. You find yourselves by some mountain track, by the edge of a cliff.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to succeed in trading, one must learn to eliminate emotional reactions and make decisions based on objective facts. This requires discipline and the ability to strip actions of their emotional dregs. By approaching situations logically and objectively, we can reduce difficulty and increase our chances of success. Remember, life is a system where you can win or lose, but by mastering your emotions, you can increase your chances of winning."
