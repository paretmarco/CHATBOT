  "title": "Why Does Therapy Often Fail to Heal Our True Self and What is the Role of ESSENCE in the Process?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of False Core-False Self, which is a holographic piece where one cannot exist without the other. The problem is that we deny our essential qualities while seeking them, creating a False Self Compensator. In psychotherapy, there is a tendency to reinforce the False Self, making healing ineffective. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses how growing awareness of ESSENCE can help shift our fixation on the False Core-False Self and end the trance. This is a major awakening, which can lead to a transformative experience.",
  "content": "In psychotherapy or even spiritual work, there is a story created even further after the fact to explain how to overcome this false conclusion. 29 The Way of the Human 9 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness project essential qualities onto others as if having a relationship with another or owning this or that will \"get me love.\" In a workshop recently, a woman told me, \"Gurdjieff said that you have to grow ESSENCE.\" I think what he meant was, You have to grow the awareness of ESSENCE. And this requires freeing up the awareness you have fixated on your False Core-False Self. Simply put, we deny and resist our ESSENCE because it is fused with the shock of the Realization of Separation and thus we blame and want to get rid of that (mislabeled) emptiness, too. Once we realize that we are resisting only our ESSENCE, everything shifts and the fixation on the False Core-False Self begins to soften. This is a major awakening. If the trance of the False Core-False Self does not end, you will always unknowingly \"act it out\" (see Volume II). That was the piece I found missing in India.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to fully embrace our essence and break free from the limitations of the False Core-False Self, we must become aware of our fixations and resistances. This process of growth may take time and effort, but the rewards of true self-awareness and inner peace are invaluable. Through psychotherapy or spiritual work, we can begin to soften our fixation on the False Core-False Self and awaken to our true essence. Don't give up on this journey - it's worth it."
