  "content": "Sustaining attention How to sustain attention: Here are some useful stratagems to attract peopleâ€™s attention to the critical aspects of a particular conversation: Method 1, which is used for the sake of sustaining attention: We might carry out a simple experiment: If the one you are busy talking to stops looking at you, you will find that, even though he might turn his eyes elsewhere, he will make use of that opportunity so as to be the one who in turn takes the initiative of looking at your face; as soon as he has resumed the action of looking at your person, you should also make sure to look at him again, straight in his eyes, as you would then be likely to score the final victory before he withdraws from the act of looking at your face. Method 2, which is resorted to so as to attract attention in the first place: Another method consists in using an object. Some salesmen take out a brochure or a folded pamphlet, and then display it to the individual they are addressing.",
