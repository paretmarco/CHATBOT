  "title": "\"How can we create a well-reasoned life plan with minor plans and specific objectives?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This excerpt discusses the importance of creating minor plans and specific objectives that are achievable within a certain period. The author argues that while retaining supreme ideals for one's lifetime, it is practical to implement minor plans containing minor goals for a period of time. These plans should be in line with one's age, health, and means, and be divided into yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily plans. Working according to this system provides a clear roadmap, unlike those who work without a plan. In the last 200 tokens, the author highlights the benefits of using this system for planning, comparing it to walking on an open road compared to forcing one's way through a pathless forest.",
  "content": "In essence, in conformity with what we can easily observe in respect of the periods of our life we have spent in a state of relatively immutable conditions, which are then suddenly followed by uncertainty, we shall limit ourselves to laying out a plan for one such period. This period might extend to a single year or it might encompass a 10 years' span. Even in the latter case, it would still be convenient to divide the plan into a number of segments, and thus articulate it as a series of minor plans. The ideal time unit shall often consist in one year. We might then sub-divide the annual plan into 12 monthly plans, each one of them being subdivided in turn into weekly and— lastly — daily plans. As we shall see here under, there is, between those who work according to this system and the people who work without any system, the same difference that exists between the person who walks on an open road and the individual who is forced to wriggle his way through a pathless forest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing a well-reasoned life plan that includes all aspects of our activity is essential to ensure we are paying due regard to our relative degrees of importance and mutual impact. By breaking down our plan into smaller segments, such as yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily plans, we can better coordinate the different \"frames of the self\" and avoid encroaching upon one another. Following a structured approach to life can make all the difference in achieving our goals, much like the difference between walking on an open road and wriggling through a pathless forest."
