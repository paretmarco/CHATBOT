  "title": "\"Why do some people create confusion to feel powerful, and how does it impact their lives?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the idea was discussed about how children use confusing tactics to feel powerful when they actually feel powerless. It was highlighted that this creation of confusion can be a powerful tool when used correctly. This claim is exemplified in the final 200 tokens of the text, where Milton H. Erickson, a powerful hypnotherapist, developed the use of confusion in his practice to help clients overcome interference and powerlessness. The author argues that Erickson's experience with polio and strokes may have led to his deep understanding of confusion and powerlessness, which he used creatively to empower himself and others. However, the author also warns against the automatic creation of confusion, which can lead to isolation and alienation. The overly-intellectual person is identified as someone who may fall into this trap.",
  "content": "It is the opinion of this author that Erickson, as would anyone who suffered from polio and strokes, went through deep powerlessness, confusion, and chaos, which were time frozen. He then utilized that state and did unto others that which was done unto him; created confusion in others. He used this, however, to help people by-pass conscious interference and helped them feel powerful when they complained of feeling powerless in their lives. Erickson could also feel powerful inducing confusion in others, which was done unto him. This would enable Erickson to counter his own feelings of powerlessness by keeping others \"one down,\" and himself \"one up.\" This was the creative genius of Erickson, utilizing his own Con-fusion + 99 process of confusion to help empower others and himself. When creation of confusion to handle powerlessness is placed on automatic, however, the individual begins to experience feelings of isolation, alienation, being misunderstood and loneliness, be- cause to maintain the feeling of power and control, a person must continue to create confusion in others and in his own world. Often the overly-intellectual person will use the above strategy.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while confusion can be a useful tool for empowering oneself and others, it is important to recognize when the creation of confusion has become automatic and perpetual. This can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, and loneliness, as maintaining a sense of power requires a constant state of confusion in oneself and others. It is crucial to acknowledge and address the underlying feelings of powerlessness or the need to be one-up in order to break free from this cycle and regain a sense of choice and connection in one's life."
