  "content": "The way we evolve is due to the assistance lent by our unconscious mind, and there are times when an illustrating example, or a metaphor, might stimulate us. It is indeed “curious” how a person might succeed in attaining his aims; one’s itineraries, events and existential experiences might be of the most disparate type, and yet, provided we pay attention, they might take us to the destination we would truly like to aim for. In the case of a 19 year old youngster who did not have a clear perception of his life objective or purpose as yet, he would sometimes find it useful to listen “attentively” to advices being voiced. In order to make him more accountable, his father told him to start taking care of his personal savings. Has it ever happened to you to find yourselves in some novel situation? A world like that of the banks: It was for him a wholly uncharted territory. With a lot of commitment and the study of some books on finance, he began to master the rudiments of how to go about in that field of life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, paying attention to the experiences we accumulate in life, seeking guidance, and challenging ourselves to explore uncharted territories can lead us to discover and evolve towards our true life objectives. Therefore, let us not limit ourselves to what we know, but also embrace the unknown with curiosity and determination."
