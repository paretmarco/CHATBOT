  "title": "What is the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and how does it relate to Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author explores the concept of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, or the SELF, which is beyond pure awareness and where Quantum Psychology comes to an end. The author relates a student's experience with meditation on this concept, realizing that the \"I\" that thinks it is in control is an illusion, and it is actually the VOID that moves everything. The principle of Yoga that \"I am not the doer\" is discussed, and the author emphasizes that the VOID creates the mind and everything else, appearing solid and condensed. The NOT-I-I, where pure awareness resides, is the end point of Quantum Psychology, beyond which the SELF resides. The author concludes, \"And YOU ARE THAT.\"",
  "content": "It's the old saying: \"there but for the grace of God (the VOID) go I.\" The VOID creates the mind by appearing to become solid, by condensing down, and ultimately, to see the mind and everything else as made of and by the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (SELF) and as THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: See each dimension as VOID The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology CONCLUSION The NOT-I-I is \"where\" Quantum Psychology \"ends.\" The NOT-I-I is \"where\" pure awareness resides, beyond this is the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, also called the SELF, THAT, etc. It is \"there\" \"where\" Quantum Psychology, awareness itself, and the \"you\" \"you\" call \"you\" disappear. And YOU ARE THAT. Good-bye with love, your x-brother Stephen ________________ CHAPTER V THE VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS \"There is no there there, there is no here here.\" Gertrude Stein \"That there is no location is the cornerstone of quantum physics.\" Neils Bohr QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Awareness is a condensation of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. It is the condensed VOID being aware of itself.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and embracing it as the ultimate reality beyond awareness leads to a profound realization of the true nature of the self. By seeing each dimension as VOID, we can go beyond Quantum Psychology and access a state of pure awareness where the \"you\" disappears, and you become one with THAT, the SELF, and the VOID."
