  "title": "How can we attain our desired state by presentifying our vision and using our imagination?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author explains how to use psychological techniques to shift our vision from a future state to a present one, where we imagine ourselves adorned with qualities we desire. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the concept of dynamic vision, which is a tangible vision of our ideal selves, free from harmful vices and filled with joy. The author also touches on the art of conjuring up scenes through imagination, which Paracelsus regarded as a form of magic.",
  "content": "We can notice the fact that, more than phrase 73, the disciple who has reached this stage in his apprenticeship will only be facing the tangible vision, a hallucination of his own self, we would be almost tempted to say, which is free from the harmful vice, a vision of his delivered self passing unperturbed by the tobacco shops, declining to accept the friendâ€™s offer of a cigarette, brimful of the joy of being able at last to feel the freshness of his natural breath, to notice colour having returned to his face, to hear his heart beating in his chest at a normal speed, etc. This is what we term the dynamic vision, which is clearly different, as we can see, from the static type. The same consideration holds true of our desire to achieve a result in our life. We have to evoke a complete image for ourselves. This art of conjuring up scenes through our imagination, or ideoplastic 74, which is fuelled by the intention of seeing them materialize in the realm of actual reality, had already been regarded by Paracelsus as a form of magic properly so-called.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by conjuring up a clear and complete image of our desired outcome using our imagination and fueling it with a strong intention, we can materialize it into actual reality. We must avoid weak desire and instead become strong attracting magnets by harnessing the power of time and the universe around us. With conscious effort and a dynamic vision of our delivered selves, we can experience the joy of a fresh breath, a healthy body, and a life that reflects our deepest desires."
