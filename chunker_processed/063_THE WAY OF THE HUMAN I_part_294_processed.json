  "title": "How to differentiate present-time body from past-time body image in therapy to access primal energy?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part, Nancy and Wolinsky continue their therapeutic conversation, exploring feelings of love, vulnerability, and openness to life. They discuss the difference between her present-time self and her past self as a little girl. Wolinsky asks her to externalize her past identity to help her give up acquired identities frozen in time, so she can have her light and primal energy in present time. The therapeutic note explains the numbness was a buffer to protect the light, and there are no personal issues, only acquired identities that need to be worked on.",
  "content": "If you took the label off of vulnerable and had it as just energy. Yes. Great! The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Nancy:Uh-huh and I still have my zipper. It's open but if I have to I can zip it back up again. Wolinsky:Anything else you want to say? Nancy:No, it doesn't have words to it...just peaceful and energetic Therapeutic Note (To Group) The numbness was a buffer to protect the light. The major track is to try to get her to give this stuff back to morn (i.e., externalize the internalized Morn, who she had thought was her). We have the external morn who is going to try to quelch the fire, which is now internalized. We need to externalize both acquired identities which are frozen in time so they can be given up. In this way, she can have her light and primal energy in present time. You don't have any issues. Identities have issues. You can never work on yourself, you can only work on the identity which you took on and fused with and think you are.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the key to resolving past traumas and emotions lies in externalizing acquired identities frozen in time and differentiating reality from past-time body images. By doing so, we can live in the present moment, free from the constraints of our past and experience peaceful and energetic lives free of identity-based issues."
