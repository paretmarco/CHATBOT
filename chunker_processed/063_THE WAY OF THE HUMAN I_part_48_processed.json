  "title": "What is Multi-Dimensional Awareness in Quantum Psychology and how can it be achieved?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we dive deeper into the concept of multi-dimensional awareness and the idea of dismantling versus transcendence. The text explains that while essence and void are always present, it is essential to dismantle our fixated awareness in order to develop multi-dimensional awareness. The names of several people and concepts are mentioned, including physicist John Wheeler and Nisargadatta Maharaj. The author also provides an illustration to help readers better understand the interactions and relationships between different dimensions.",
  "content": "21 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness External Dimension Thinking Dimension Emotional Dimension Biological Animal Dimension Chapter 11 on ESSENCE. ESSENCE is always there; the VOID is always there. But \"you\" can work on dismantling your fixated Awareness. MULTI--DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS DISMANTLING VS. TRANSCENDENCE Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"You cannot let go of something until you know what is is.\" Often spiritual systems are more into transcendence (trying to go beyond) and not dismantling. In many \"Spiritual\" traditions there is an idea that if I repeat my mantra enough and meditate enough, I will transcend the ego or mind, and I won't be identified with it any longer. This \"Spiritual\" theory is that through mantra, yantra, or tantra, you can go beyond the mind or somehow change your \"vibration\" in order to stabilize awareness in ESSENCE, I AM, etc., without having to recognize how your awareness is chronically fixated. As we will see below and in Volume I, this rarely works, is confusing and, in addition, collapses all of the diniensions.",
  "last_phrase": "To achieve multi-dimensional awareness, one must be willing to own and experience their psychology before they can dismantle it. As Nisargadatta Maharaj said, \"In order to let go of something, you must first know what it is.\" Quantum Psychology offers a practical approach to transcendence that involves understanding and working with our fixated awareness."
