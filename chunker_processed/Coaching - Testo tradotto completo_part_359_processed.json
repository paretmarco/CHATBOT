Finally, the author notes that consistent practice and training are necessary to yield the full benefits of self-magnetization.",
  "content": "Nothing to worry about: Even assuming that the purpose had not yet been attained, the effect of this incipient attempt at self-magnetizing would not be laid to waste, as it would have paved your way and caused the subsequent stages to proceed more smoothly. Persevere with it during the following evening, or when you are in a position to grant yourselves a second formula which is identical to the first one, and then cling to this practice regularly, with an unflinching confidence that you will reap the benefit of ultimate success. Let us emphasize the point once more: We can easily eliminate, merely by practicing for a few fays in accordance with the foregoing, habits which have become deeply rooted and firmly crystallized over a period of many years. There are some people who fail to extract from the methodology of this work all the consequential fruits which it might regale them with, due to the fact that, although they have grasped it by their understanding, they soon become weary of it. What occurs in this connection is exactly what takes place in every other field of life: The brain must necessarily get used, it must train itself and hone its proficiency in this specific path.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by persevering and practicing the self-magnetizing technique regularly, you can eliminate deeply rooted negative habits and pave the way for success. Don't become weary of the process, as the brain needs to train itself and hone its proficiency. Remember, the technique may seem long at first, but with practice, the various operations will quickly follow one another, requiring only a few minutes to complete. So, start practicing and enjoy the consequential fruits of your labor!"
