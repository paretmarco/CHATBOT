  "first_phrase": "In this section, we will explore some exercises that can help in building a better spinal column and make us more energetic. Before that, we discussed a breathing exercise that can be done while walking. This exercise involves taking a regular walk while counting steps and gradually adding breathing techniques to it. We suggest focusing on neck exercises as they have a significant impact on the cervical spine, which enhances the nervous system's energy and indirectly improves our mental abilities.",

It helps to carry out this exercise several times a day. By walking slowly, you will be able to breathe according to the 6/3 formula. Exercises for the spinal column The exercising which stimulates the spinal column is an important one. Whatever lends strength to the spinal column is in fact useful. Building a better spinal column has the meaning of building a better and more energetic human being. We firstly suggest, with regard to the appropriate movement, to carry out especially the neck exercises, as they have a most pronounced impact on the cervical spine. In the light of the fact that such movements aim at conferring energy on the nervous system, one can understand why they would also have a direct influence on our mental faculties as well.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the 6/3 breathing exercise several times a day and focusing on proper spinal column movements can improve energy levels and overall well-being. Engaging in exercises that target the neck and spine, such as the recommended Exercise 31, can provide long-term benefits for physical and mental health. Remember to take breaks when feeling tired and resume at will to reap the benefits over time."
