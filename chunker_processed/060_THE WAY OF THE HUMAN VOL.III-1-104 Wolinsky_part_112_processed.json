  "title": "What is the role of mantras and the electro-magnetic mechanism in changing perception and achieving enlightenment?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept that the perception of self and enlightenment is a by-product of the electromagnetic mechanism. The mechanism uses mantras, yantras, and tantras to change the perception of the individual by changing the vibrational pattern. The I AM is created from this superstring wave, and the collective is an electro-magnetic field where energy patterns take form. The text ends with an illustration of how Louise experiences this powerful coil field in her chest.",
  "content": "* The Electro-magnetic mechanism makes me believe that there was light first, that there is a first, and that in enlightenment you must or will \"see\" light, rather than realizing prior to light is Beyond. * I believed there were different lights to be seen and when I see or saw them I would be en-lightened. ARCHETYPES OF WAVES AND THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC MECHANISM * The I AM is a wave created by supertrings. * The \"I AM\" is the end product of the Superstrings which are first visible through waves. * God is the invisible force which organizes the universe. Wolinsky: Louise: DEMONSTRATION #2 ELECTROMAGNETICS Define Electromagnetics. It is a coiled, powerful field, constructive or destructive, it is measurable, difficult to deal with it, has polarity and a frequency which changes. * We call it God because we do not know what to call it. ARCHETYPES OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC MECHANISM AND THE COLLECTIVE * The Collective is an electro-magnetic field where \"energy\" patterns take form and have their own life, i.e., a VOID pattern. 106 Wolinsky:Where do you experience this powerful coil field in your body? Louise:In my chest.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the electro-magnetic mechanism is a complex and powerful force that can be both constructive and destructive. Understanding its impact on our bodies and environment can help us better organize our lives around energy and maintain balance. By recognizing the invisible force that organizes the universe, we may find enlightenment in the patterns of light and waves that surround us."
