  "title": "What is the Quantum Psychology principle that states the observer is part of the observed and why is it important?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the Quantum Psychology Principle that states that the observer is part of the observed, which is also seen in Werner Heisenberg's theory of Quantum Physics. The text emphasizes the importance of developing and observing the observer and the observed, realizing that they are inseparable. The concept of an infinite number of observers and experiences is discussed, which differs from some meditation systems that believe in one observer that exists before the observed. The last 200 tokens delve into how an observer and thought arise and subside together as one unit, emphasizing the observer as a part of the observed structure.",
  "content": "The NOT-I-I is beyond the, observer-observed dyad; it is Pure Awareness which a yogi would call WITNESSING (the observer-observed dyad). (See Volume III.) The observer is the ego observing itself. The observer is actually a part of the structure it is observing and it too has to be gone beyond. Some systems, like Vipassana (insight), Buddhist meditation, or Gurdjieff work as it is presently being taught, think there is one observer which observes and exists \"before\" the observed. They don't get that the observer is part of the observed and that there are an infinite number of observers along with an infinite number of experiences.' In this way if \"I'm\" sitting here in self-observation, it often appears as though a thought comes up like \"I love myself' or \"I hate myself.\" But actually what happens—and this is the major difference in the Quantum work—is that both an observer and an observed (thought) simultaneously arise and subside together as one unit. And then a new observer or thought or experience arises and subsides together as one unit.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly access Pure Awareness, or the NOT-I-I, it is necessary to go beyond the observer-observed dyad and the illusions that the observer has about itself. By recognizing that the observer is not separate from what it is observing, that it does not create what it is looking at, and that it did not exist before that which it is observing, one can begin to dissolve the False Core-False Self and move towards a state of observation with no object. This process requires an understanding of the infinite number of observers that arise and subside with each experience and a recognition that the ego itself is part of the structure it is observing."
