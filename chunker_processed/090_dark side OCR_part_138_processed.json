  "title": "Why does the mind create illusions and how do they solidify?",
  "first_phrase": "The final part of this text focuses on the solidification of illusions, showing how they persist and escalate in individuals who learn to envision themselves as something or someone else to cope with childhood trauma. The story of a woman who created an illusion of being like Christ to survive and who continues to experience the presence of beings as an adult is shared alongside Erickson's tale of a man who thought he was Jesus. This last part shows how illusions can be shifted by a skilled therapist, as Erickson used carpentry work to break the Jesus illusion.",
  "content": "Erickson' s story of a man in a mental institution who thinks he is Jesus and sits waiting for his disciples also demonstrates this solidifying of illusions. The man/Jesus was so convinced that no therapists could talk him out of the trance. The story has it that Erickson utilized his trance to make a shift in his behavior. Erickson allegedly went over to the man and said, \"I hear you are a carpenter.\" The Jesus/man is now in a double bind. If he says \"no,\" then he's not Jesus. If he says \"yes,\" then he doesn't know what will happen. He said \"yes\". Erickson said, \"Come with me. There is some carpentry work that needs to be done in the new wing of the hospital.\" I don't know the conclusion to this story, but many of Erickson's stories seem to end with Erickson's illusion of health; and \"He got married and had three children.\" In the development of illusions, the greater the stress in life the stronger the illusions.",
  "last_phrase": "It is important to be aware of the power of illusions and how they can affect our behavior and perception of reality. Recognizing when we are caught up in illusions and finding practical ways to shift our perception can be key to maintaining mental health and well-being."
