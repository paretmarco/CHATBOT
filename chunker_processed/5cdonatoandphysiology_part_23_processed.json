  "title": "What is Hypnotism and How Does it Work?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author describes his ability to manipulate a patient's actions and thoughts through different forms of paralysis and suggestion. In the last 200 tokens, the author goes into more detail about the extent of his control, describing how the patient's individuality is erased and he becomes absorbed in the author's will. The author can make the patient feel, think, and do anything he desires, no matter how unreal or unnatural, without any resistance. The patient is not asleep during this phase, but fully conscious of his actions and the experiments he is undergoing. The author gives examples of his power, such as making subjects immobile in front of a camera or causing them to laugh uncontrollably.",
  "content": "At first he saw, heard and felt only me; now he feels, thinks, desires and acts only in conformity to my caprice. I can force upon him the falsest ideas, the most illusory sensations, the most unnatural desires, the strangest acts. He accepts them and obeys without resistance. He has abdicated his will without regret, under the charm of a seductive fascination. This is the unconscious phase; it presents none of the characteristics of either physiological or pathological sleep. I will speak further on of suggestion in its expiration. When the subjects are quite docile the most marvelous results are obtained at once. Thus in presence of the photographic apparatus I have attracted a number of subjects by a glance; then gesture I have rendered them as immobile as wax figures in a museum. In another photograph is represented a subject seated in an armchair. Laughing slightly, I looked at him. He commenced to laugh by imitation, and then his risibility was progressively accentuated, until he was in an ecstasy of hilarity at the moment in which he was photographed. I could as easily make him sing, cough, sneeze, make faces, etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of suggestion is truly remarkable, as it can completely control a person's thoughts, desires, and actions. Through a seductive fascination, individuals may willingly abdicate their will, leading to illusions and unnatural behaviors. With precise suggestion, even the greatest performers can be overshadowed, demonstrating the incredible potential of this force."
