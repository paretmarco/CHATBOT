  "title": "What is Practical Ideation and How Does it Connect Ideals, Actions, and Time?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of practical ideation which involves building a plan for activity based on available elements and desired results. It creates order in life and aims to efficiently build a sequence of interrelated facts for a purposeful goal. The last 200 tokens discuss the importance of taking a higher dimension into account and viewing life as one single day of eternity. Every single day is obliged to accomplish part of the overall task assigned to life while also being a self-contained lesser whole. Failing to recognize this will make it difficult to give a purpose to one's existence.",
  "content": "ideal as outcome of a sequence of stages aiming at a purposeful goal Today’s action arises out of yesterday’s action, and is in turn the basis of tomorrow’s action. In essence, we must therefore come to conceive life as one single day where the years are represented by the hours, and the hours by the seconds: The day of eternity. Our own life, indeed, is nothing other than some part of a vaster whole. If we really want to inject meaningfulness into it, we must take this higher dimension into account. Whoever fails to pay heed to that properly will be unable to confer a clearly demarcated purpose on his own existence 48. Once this concept is well entrenched in our mind, the natural corollary which is inferred from it is that every single day will be obliged to accomplish, even to a most negligible extent, part of the overall task assigned to life as a whole, in spite of the fact that, simultaneously, any such separate day has its own validity as a self-contained lesser whole.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to remember that our lives are a continuous sequence of stages, and every day is an opportunity to move towards our purposeful goals while also being a self-contained unit. By embracing the concept of opportunities and acknowledging the randomness of reality, we can achieve a clearer understanding of our purpose and inject meaningfulness into our existence."
