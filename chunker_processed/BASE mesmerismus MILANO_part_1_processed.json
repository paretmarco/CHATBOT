  "title": "\"What are the harmonic exercises and energy breathing techniques showcased in the Milan demo during a crisis?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we have described the first two days of the demonstration and the harmonious exercises performed in Milan. Now, in the last part, we will discuss the flexibility exercises, which include backward fall preparation, forward and backward movements, oscillations, and rough gaze. Additionally, we'll talk about the hypnotic points and energy transmissions through breathing. Throughout this part, we'll refer to the demonstrators and the concepts that were previously introduced.",
  "content": "PRIMO GIORNO DEMO CRISI SECONDO GIORNO MILANO ESERCIZI ARMONICI DEMO FORZA CARICHE CADUTA INDIETRO CON PREPARAZIONE AVANTI INDIETRO DEMO FLESSIBILITA OSCILLAZIONI + SGUARDO GREZZO + PUNTI IPNOGENI + RESPIRAZIONI DI ENERGIA CHE SI TRASMETTONO",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to improve your overall physical performance, it is crucial to incorporate harmonic exercises, flexibility training, and breathing techniques into your routine. Remember to prepare for movements such as forward and backward falls, oscillations, and to maintain proper posture with a focused gaze. Additionally, consider incorporating hypnogenic points, raw energy transmissions, and energy-releasing breaths to maximize the benefits of your workout routine. By applying the knowledge gained from the first day's crisis, Milan's second-day demos, and these practical exercises, you can build strength and resilience for a healthy and active lifestyle."
