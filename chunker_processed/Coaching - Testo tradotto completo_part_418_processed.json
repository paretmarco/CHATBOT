  "title": "How can developing presence increase power and consciousness in everyday life?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of presence, and how developing a deeper sensory awareness can enhance our effectiveness. In the higher level of presence, we become conscious of both our actions and the meanings we confer upon things. The text uses the analogy of driving a car at high speed to illustrate the importance of being alert and having a strategy. It also highlights how many people lack power in their lives because they lack consciousness, and argues that increasing consciousness can lead to greater power and the ability to truly live existence.",
  "content": "Drivers are indeed appreciated precisely because of this capacity which enables them both to have a strategy for driving and to be simultaneously alert to the faintest noises, movements etc of the car. The same principle lies behind power as it is experienced in everyday life. Most people have power in the small things and thus succeed, the way a child would do, in obtaining what they want from others by being insistent, although that might not be what they truly desire, and is other than what they want in life. Any such person spends his existence in single isolated moments which are detached from a continuous form of self-consciousness. He switches from joy to sadness, breathlessly panting in the pursuit of something he has forced himself to achieve. At the end of the road, he realizes that he has not lived existence, but that he has rather been lived by it. We lack power because we lack consciousness. The more, however, we increase consciousness, the greater the power we come to have, whereupon we might actually live out existence.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, true power lies in increasing our consciousness and becoming more present in our actions. By doing so, we can live out our existence instead of being lived by it. It is through this practice that we truly obtain power, not just in the small things but in larger aspects of our lives, empowering us to unravel the complex web of relationships we have with others."
