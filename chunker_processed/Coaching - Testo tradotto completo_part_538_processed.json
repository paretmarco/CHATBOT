  "title": "\"How can discovering our own ideals and coordinating our actions help us achieve our goals in life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of ideals and how they can serve as a guiding force in our lives. The author emphasizes the importance of having a dominant ideal as a fulcrum for our actions in order to avoid dispersion of energies. The good news is that it is never too late to take charge of our lives and head towards our ideal direction. Discovering our own ideals requires establishing a connection with ourselves and exercising our human faculty of will to coordinate our actions towards our aims. The text concludes by highlighting the benefits of disciplining our will to create well-arranged mental representations and autonomous centers of interest and activity.",
  "content": "Though this is something which is present in every person, we might only unravel it and lay it bare by establishing a connection with our own selves. It is indeed possible to assert that the one who has lived happily is he who has been able to work all his life on the accomplishment of his specific ideal, without suffering either material or moral lapses along the way. Discovering our own ideals by establishing connection with our own self Without seeking to delve into the moral sphere, being a sphere where we do not wish to set foot in the least, we can notice that exercising a higher human faculty, namely, will, is fundamentally nothing other than the ability to set limits on one’s own action and coordinate one’s acts towards it. WILL = SETTING AIMS WHICH ARE COORDINATED WITH ONE’S OWN ACTION Disciplining one’s will carries the meaning of giving rise to new, well arranged masses of mental representations, being systems of ideational functions capable of turning into autonomous centres of interest and activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, discovering and establishing our own ideals by connecting with ourselves is key to living a happy life. By disciplining our will, setting coordinated aims, and educating it through well-arranged mental representations, we can substitute impulsive actions with synchronized ones that are harmonious with the Universe. Though having a plan might seem counterintuitive to living in the present moment, it can actually help us focus on opportunities that can only be discovered by being anchored in the now."
