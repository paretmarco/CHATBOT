  "title": "How can intuition and openness lead to success in management and trading?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author talks about the concept of the blink manager, who has honed their skills of judgment through years of experience to the point where their intuition is exceptionally sophisticated. Drawing an analogy with football, they argue that a successful player relies on instinct, and a successful manager should do the same. The text emphasizes the importance of gathering information and allowing for unconscious elaboration, while avoiding the trap of hoping for a specific outcome. The last 200 tokens outline the \"dynamics of intuition\" in trading, from collecting information to putting solutions into practice.",
  "content": "Seen from the trader’s point of view, he needs to have faith in his instinct, which is something that might represent an advantage, provided it springs out of experience. In quantum terms, this ensures us that the \"quantum register is filled out thoroughly\". Essentially, what we are stating is that it is possible to optimize the process by which \"intuitive acumen\" might be created in a person. We might, in other words, optimize our capacity to respond. In that case, it suits us to gather all the possible information about a particular subject, and to subsequently allow our intuitive elaboration to be set in motion. In this instance, too, an important role is played by “knowing not to know”. One of the main enemies of intuition is \"to want things to proceed along a specific direction\". We must in other words avoid the trap of our hopes possibly interfering with the process we have just described here above. In trading we can thus apply the so-called \"dynamics of intuition”: Collecting information – phase of unconscious elaboration - gathering solutions – putting them into practice or critically refuting them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by optimizing our capacity for intuitive acumen, we can better respond to opportunities in trading and in life. This involves gathering information, allowing for unconscious elaboration, and being open to new roads for the future. We must also avoid the trap of our hopes interfering with the process and be mindful of the limitations of our memories and emotions. With an open and receptive mind, we can better interface with the random world around us and reach optimal results."
