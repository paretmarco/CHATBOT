We use only non verbal communication, few words and obviously the mind. Ancient magnetists realized some very spectacular feats: “The next experiment was equally successful. The other girl, whom Mr. A. de Constant had also under his influence, was placed while in a waking state with her back to the wall. Mr. de Constant then took me aside, and asked me which part of the subject he should paralyze by his silent will? I wrote down, “La jambe gauche.” He then, standing about two yards from the girl, made an effort of will, after which he told the girl to move about: upon which she moved every limb except her left leg, which had become perfectly rigid. In the same way the girl’s right leg, and then one of her arms, were paralyzed. But the most curious thing was when I desired that the girl’s head might become motionless. It was literally stuck to the wall by the silent will of the Mesmeriser. Her arms, her legs could move, but not her head; so that she could only walk forward as far as the attachment by her head would permit.",
