  "title": "How can daydreaming and freeing time help in creating a practical life plan?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the concept of daydreaming was discussed, which involves imagining a desired goal and transcending the obstacles that may stand in the way of achieving it. However, negative emotions from the past may hinder this process, making it difficult to perceive new opportunities. In this final part, the focus shifts to practical steps for building one's life plan. It emphasizes the importance of starting from one's current circumstances and subjective aspirations, and demarcates three phases in the process of defining a life plan. The section includes an exercise where one can free themselves from negative emotions by imagining a sphere of light visiting events from the past and future.",
  "content": "Imagine (always keeping the eyes, however, in a posture of convergence, and thus “knowing” rather than “observing”) that the sphere of light were to pay a visit to events from both the past and the future. Open your eyes. If you have succeeded in implementing the exercise without abandoning ocular convergence at the time when the sphere was visiting the events, you will experience a pleasant sensation. Light – Imagined sphere Diagram of the exercise on «freeing time» How to practically build one’s plan: From today to the future We must know where we are and where are we starting from. The life plan is not some fantasy castle. Rather, it is imperative that it should rest solidly on the reality of our current circumstances, on the possibilities which life is actually granting us, and on our subjective aspirations-inclinations, which likewise consist, as such, in a reality. We might be able to demarcate three phases in the process of defining the life plan.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by imagining the sphere of light to visit events from both the past and the future, and by implementing the exercise of \"freeing time,\" we can create a solid life plan that is based on the reality of our current circumstances, available resources, and subjective aspirations. By demarcating three phases of defining the life plan, we can identify positive features, available resources, and set broad and optimistic goals that we wholeheartedly work towards accomplishing. Remember, the life plan is not a fantasy castle but a practical way to achieve our dreams."
