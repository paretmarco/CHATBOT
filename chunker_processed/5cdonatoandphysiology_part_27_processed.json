  "title": "What were Doctor Lombroso's experiments on hypnosis and were they valid?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author recounts controversial experiments performed by Doctor Lombroso and Doctor Luys on hypnotized patients. The former claims to have witnessed a woman read letters without using her eyes and students write and speak in languages they did not know, allegations challenged by the patients. The latter's experiments with glass tubes and hypnotized women were declared false by an academic commission. In contrast, the author claims to have conducted successful experiments on cabin boys, lawyers, and even transformed a prince into his man servant. The author also describes using antithesis to influence Count Maurice Fleury to dance a wild can-can.",
  "content": "At the request of the queen of Belgium I gave a stance at the Theatre d'Ostende on the nth of August 1887 at which all the court assisted. I had asked the commander of the marine school to bring me about twenty cabin boys with whom I might experiment, to put aside all suspicion of trickery. That night I invented complicated scenes of fishing, swimming, navigation and shipwreck. When I fascinated lawyers, as in Milan, Gaud and Douai, I made them deliver political speeches, or I composed a tribunal with judges, public accusers, defendants, etc. In Yassy (Romania) the judge was easily found, since I fascinated the president of the tribunal in the presence of Queen Natalie of Servia. Experiments have also been suggested to me by antithesis. It was thus that in 1882 in Paris it occurred to me to make Prince Louis Murat wait upon me, having transformed him into a man servant by the force of my will. And again I obliged Count Maurice Fleury, son of General Fleury, a gentle young man, reserved and timid, to dance a wild can-can before his astonished friends.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through his performances at various venues and experiments with willing participants, this mesmerist was able to demonstrate the incredible power of suggestion and the potential of the human mind to be influenced and controlled. These insights may prove useful for those seeking to explore the limits of the mind or harness its potential for personal growth and development."
