The text discusses the importance of focusing on the operator rather than the done, and how certain techniques can lead to psychosomatic problems if not in line with the human nature. The text also describes the two fundamental ways for the development of the person: path A and path B, and explains how the techniques taught in their school can help individuals achieve their goals while also working towards a transformation of the human being.

In practice, the participant solves all its states of stress baseline. Ordinary man’s mind is full of a cloud of thinking and of want. The first step needs a person to create a clear mind - the ancient alchemists called it making the salt crystal clear. It means a mind no more cluttered by the encrusting of habits and a different relationship with the body where we live in the body. Step 2 – grasping the first level quantum view of reality. At level 2 the participant expands the basics and become better able to master the external activators to expand its awareness. He experiences the natural series basis of some deep states of consciousness and can already start with the first steps of growth thereafter. Such states are important as well as for individual development, and also are of great importance in the therapy and are the basis of the model of long-term permanent change.",
