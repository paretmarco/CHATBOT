  "title": "\"How can coaching using people’s role-related 'trances' improve effective communication?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final segment, we delve into the significance of coaching and effective communication by using people's role-related \"trances.\" As mentioned earlier, people are often lost in a maze of conceptualizations and mental constructions that hinder them from being present, which is the only thing that truly exists. The ultimate goal of refined coaching is to help people understand this truth and create a communication style that promotes growth and development of potential. The people we meet in life are usually in a \"trance,\" dreaming of an imaginary future without rational analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to be present and active in decision-making.",
  "content": "The people we meet in life are in a “trance”: They dream of an imaginary future, without analyzing whether they can in fact reach it, alternatively, they “do as they see others doing”, and so on and so forth. Let us take for instance what advertising does. It creates a link with dreams. We buy, for example, a particular product, because we are “fascinated” and “involved” by a certain advert or by fashion, which generates in us a lack of ability to engage in a logical critique. Thereafter, we think we have purchased something on the basis of its usefulness. Therefore, it happens quite frequently that, when we accept an idea which establishes a link with our “trance”, we subsequently rationalize that idea and persuade ourselves that our choice to embrace it was actually the fruit of some logical process. The faculty of being able to choose is only active in that man who is present. Whoever is less present is usually in a “trance”, as a passive victim of his thoughts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to recognize when we are in a \"trance\" and to actively engage in the process of logical thinking. By doing so, we can distinguish between our desires and rational decisions, leading us to better choices and reducing conflicts. Being present and listening without getting involved can also help us solve conflicts in a better way, without hurting anyone's mental attitude."
