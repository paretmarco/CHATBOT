  "first_phrase": "In this final section of the text, Wolinsky and Alice explore the concept of the \"I am Alone\" False and the fear of non-existence held within the gravity container, which wants to survive. They discuss the gravity central core concept and its potential escape to the \"I don't exist\" False Core. Wolinsky asks Alice about any resistance the container may have to the idea of not existing, leading to a discussion of an exploding impulse and ultimately silence. This section is part of a larger discussion of the Archetype of Dark Matter, which affects us all despite being unknowable. The Invisible Force of dark matter rules both the seen and unseen world and can provide valuable information if we surrender to it.",
  "content": "Alice:Skin—but I feel no line of demarcation between skin boundaries and everything else right now—each molecule wants to explode out. Wolinsky:Let that happen. ________________ Alice:There would be just this silence whatever. Laughs...Silence-no words. DARK MATTER: THE INVISIBLE FORCE Ninety percent of the universe is said to be made up of Dark Matter. Scientists know it is there but they do no know what it is. Still, Dark matter as an Archetype affects all of us as will be demonstrated below by Dark Matter—the Invisible Force. FAMOUS ARCHETYPES OF DARK MATTERTHE INVISIBLE FORCE * There is an invisible force. * This invisible force rules the universe. * I must figure out the dark matter. * Everything exists in different dimensions and different universes. 120121 * The seen is all there is. * The un-seen is all there is. * There is no seer or seen. * Surrender to the unseen. * The VOID is the dark matter which is the covering or lid into the wormholes which lead into other dimensions. The dark matter is the unseen world. * The dark matter rules the seen and unseen world. * I can get information from the dark matter.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, although Dark Matter is still a mystery to scientists, its archetype as an invisible force affects all of us. By embracing the unseen, surrendering to the void, and seeking guidance from gurus in other dimensions, we can expand our understanding of the universe and our place in it."
