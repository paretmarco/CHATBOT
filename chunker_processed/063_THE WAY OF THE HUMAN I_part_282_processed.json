  "title": "\"What is the primal energy in your pelvis and how does it affect your mental health?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of \"The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness,\" Denise and Wolinsky delve deeper into the primal energy found in the pelvis. Denise describes this energy as a \"burst of fire\" while Wolinsky questions the association between primal energy and \"crazy.\" Denise reveals that her mother's manic behavior affected her own relationship with this energy, leading her to feel a need to clamp down and gain control. This is part of the False Core Conclusion, which associates primal energy with being alone instead of connecting with others.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:If you are separate, primal energy equals crazy, what doesn't occur? it down. Where do you feel that closing down? Denise:It's almost like pulling a hood over myself. It's very quick and it's very cold and it's very nonfeeling. Therapeutic Note The False Core Conclusion is the repressed animal of \"No control,\" the False Solution—clamping down the pelvis, \"I must gain control\" Therapeutic Note Another False Conclusion and association. The primal energy = \"I am alone\" thus—►False healing ,solution \"I have to connect.\" Denise:A quickening in my body. Quickening to put a hood on and clamp down. Therapeutic Note The \"I am out of control\" is fused with primal energy. Denise:There's no modeling there, it was a response to My mother. My mother was manic. Wolinsky:Now, as a little girl, what did you call this wild, manic, crazy energy that your mother had? Or did you have a word?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize and challenge the False Core Conclusions that we have developed throughout our lives, as they often become fused with our primal energy and can lead to further struggles and false solutions. By acknowledging and embracing our own energies, we can break free from these limitations and move towards true healing and connection."
