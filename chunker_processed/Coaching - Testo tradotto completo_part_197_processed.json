  "title": "\"How can we live each day to the fullest and seize opportunities in Kairòs time?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author emphasized the importance of living in the present and taking action today rather than waiting for tomorrow. The author also explored the idea of Kairòs, a distinct unit of time that is characterized by seizing opportunities and living in harmony with oneself. In the final 200 tokens, the author delves deeper into the concept of Kairòs, explaining how it differs from linear time and how living in Kairòs represents a higher plane of functioning. The text also emphasizes the importance of injecting energy into the present moment and effectively living in the now.",
  "content": "Every day must simultaneously be a masterpiece in itself, complete in itself and capable of expressing a self-contained purpose. Limiting ourselves to solely giving effect to our devoted commitment, in fact, leads to absurd results and to certain failure, since in that case life would only be lived for the sake of such commitment. Life, however, is a right, not a mission. To live in time, understood as Kairòs, further denotes the ability to seize the opportunities which life offers us. It is indeed possible that such opportunities will open up new ways. It is accordingly necessary to acquire the knowledge of how to inject energy into the now, and how to be effectively able to live the moment. Whereas linear time is born out of planning, “Kairòs” is an intuitive time in a state of “connection” and “re-integration” with one’s own being. This acting does not consist in a static reality, contrary to what takes place when the mind becomes blocked. The opposite is in fact true: This form of acting represents a higher plane of functioning.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the value of each day as a masterpiece in itself with its own purpose. Living in the present moment, known as Kairòs, requires injecting energy into the present and seizing opportunities as they arise. Let us embrace life's opportunities and live to our fullest potential, rather than limiting ourselves to fulfilling commitments, as life is a right, not a mission."
