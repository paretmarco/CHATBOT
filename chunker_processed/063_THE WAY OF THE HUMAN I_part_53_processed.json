  "title": "\"What is the False Core Driver in Quantum Psychology and how does it affect our awareness and survival?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text is a part of Quantum Psychology which aims to stabilize and liberate awareness. The author discusses The False Core and The False Core Driver— the concept or conclusion that holds our internal world together and motivates our actions for survival. The False Self Compensator is the way we try to overcome this driver. However, these survival mechanisms often see danger where there is none. The author believes that awareness should be in all dimensions, but eventually, it goes beyond awareness itself, leading to the revelation of the Nameless Absolute.",
  "content": "THE FALSE CORE (VOLUME II) \"Whatever you do, you do for your own sake: The Upanasads Chapter 11 QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Whatever the False Core-False Self does, it does for its own sake; i.e., its own survival. What is the False Core Driver? The False Core Driver is that one concept or conclusion you hold about yourself which organizes your entire psychology—every thought, association, memory, fantasy, action, reaction, etc. It holds together your entire internal world (how you perceive yourself) and how you imagine and project how others perceive you. The False Self Compensator is the way you try to overcome this primary concept. According.to Freud, \"All traumas come in chains of earlier similar events.\" In other words, \"the mind\" has an associational and generalizing tendency. In short to insure its survival, it searches and scans the environment for \"danger.\" Unfortunately, it uses the past as its reference point. In this way, the scanning-searching device, which is part of the organism's survival mechanisms, \"sees\" \"danger\" where there is none.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding your False Core Driver is essential for unraveling the web of associations that shape your internal world. By acknowledging the False Self Compensator and the mind's tendency to associate past experiences with present events, you can begin to deconstruct the False Core and create a new narrative that supports your true self. Remember, everything the False Core does, it does for its own survival, but with awareness and intention, you can reclaim your power and live a more authentic life."
