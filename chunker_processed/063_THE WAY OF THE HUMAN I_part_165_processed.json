  "title": "What is differentiated consciousness and how can it lead to a void of undifferentiated consciousness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author discussed the importance of withdrawing attention from thoughts and feelings. This is a crucial step towards cultivating the second dimensional awareness aspect of consciousness that involves making distinctions. The author explains that differentiated consciousness lets us distinguish between different things and experiences, while undifferentiated consciousness involves no preferences or comparisons. The text also introduces the concept of internal dialogue, which is the internal voice that suggests certain outcomes. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses thought as a single act of thinking and defines internal dialogue. The author also notes that differentiating consciousness is essential to appreciate the void of undifferentiated consciousness.",
  "content": "As \"I\" mentioned earlier, Nisargadatta Maharaj once said, \"You must first know what something is before you can give it up.\" 'This process was originally written about in Trance People Liveâ€”Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology (1991), 'The Shuranyama Sutra, Buddhist Text Translation Society, Volume 3 (1980), California: The Sino-American Buddhist Association, p. 22. 4Please note that differentiated consciousness possesses a separate \"1\" which has all the psychological aspects of preferences, comparisons, etc. UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS does not have or know preferences or comparisons. UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is VOIDer than the VOID itself and has no separate \"I.\" Hence, the Zen patriarch said \"The great way is easy, except for those who have preferences.\" THOUGHT is the single act of thinking; an idea or a notion.' INTERNAL DIALOGUE: Also referred to in Trances People Live as a post-hypnotic suggestion. These are internal voices which suggest certain outcomes. For example, the internal voice: \"It will never work out,\" or \"I know you're going to break up with me so I'll detach and won't het involved.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the differences between differentiated and undifferentiated consciousness, recognizing internal dialogue, and developing intuition can all be powerful ways of pursuing personal growth and healing. By embracing these concepts and practices, individuals can learn to better understand themselves, addressing deep emotional pain and unhealthy patterns to live more fulfilling and authentic lives."
