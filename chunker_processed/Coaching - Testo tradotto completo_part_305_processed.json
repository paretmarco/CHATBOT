  "title": "How can we improve our personality using the technique of personality substitution?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author describes the technique of personality substitution, which involves entering another person's being to understand their character and modus operandi. This technique can be used to change our personality for the better and overcome timidity, but requires consistent practice and studying of other people's characters. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains how creating an ideal human type can facilitate the contemplation of this technique. They suggest placing ourselves in front of a large mirror, imagining our ideal image, and imagining facing the person best qualified to lend us advice. This practice can lead to a detailed vision of our ideal character, which we can eventually use to transform ourselves.",
  "content": "We should begin by creating for ourselves an ideal human type comprising an array of features borrowed from a number of our acquaintances. Such an ideal type will have to encompass our physical, intellectual and moral ideals. We will then elaborate this composite ideal in such a manner that we might come to have of it a detailed vision which is such as to leave us in no doubt as to the attitude that this ideal character is going to adopt across the various sets of circumstances. The mirror The contemplation of this ideal might be greatly facilitated by the under-mentioned procedure: Place yourselves in front of a large mirror, yet imagining to see lying beyond the mirror, not your actual imagine, but rather the ideal image onto which you shall project your entire influence. Even in the absence of a mirror, we can imagine this character being reflected against the wall fronting us. Such a “mental picture” will remain stably ahead of us, until the time when availing ourselves of it eventually sets in. A procedure which complements the preceding one is what is set out here under: “Let is always imagine to be facing the person who is best qualified to lend us advice”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by creating an ideal image of ourselves and constantly striving towards it, we can become models of physical and mental correctness, taking care of our outer garment, attitude, speech, and comportment. It is crucial to remember that the concept of self-respect plays a vital role in this process, and we should always act out of respect for ourselves and others. Whenever we feel intimidated, we can visualize an authoritative friend next to us to shield our smallness. These simple yet powerful steps can help us navigate any critical situation we may encounter in life."
