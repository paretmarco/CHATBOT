  "title": "How Can Peripheral Movements and Hand Cues Awaken the Left Side of Vision and Increase Attention?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores how visual functions can be impaired if the eyes do not team up to process information correctly, even when each eye has normal acuity. The author delves into the concept of awakening the left side of vision and how peripheral movements can influence the perception of body position. The text also discusses the complex visual areas linked to peripheral vision and how they are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery. The final section touches on diplopia and how it can be used to render one's position uncertain through movement.",
  "content": "PMID 17042793) PERIPHERAL MOVEMENT ABSORBING This refer to absorbing the spirit of the person in front of us Diploplia Though physiological diploplia is seldom noticed in everyday life, it is readily perceived when attention is drawn to it. For example, if a pencil is held vertically a short distance in front of the eyes while a more distant object is steadily fixated, the pencil will be seen in crossed diploplia. Hence the rule: uncrossed diploplia occurs when the object is farther than fixation, crossed diploplia when it is nearer than fixation In general, the diplopic images are out of focus and insubstantial. Any impression of their distance from the eyes would be greatly influenced by prior knowledge of the actual positions of objects in question, especially if the nearer one is held in hand. This means that by movement, once a first diploplia has been obtained through dark focus concentration, we can render our position uncertain.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the concept of diplopia and the effects of peripheral movement absorbing as discussed in PMID 17042793 can greatly benefit our perception and understanding of the world around us. By mastering these ideas, we can gain a more nuanced and comprehensive view, making us better equipped to navigate life's challenges."
