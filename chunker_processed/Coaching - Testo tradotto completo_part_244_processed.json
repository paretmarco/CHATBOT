  "title": "How can one turn their profession into a fulfilling and progressive journey rather than a monotonous job?",
  "first_phrase": "This text emphasizes the importance of elevating one's profession through continuous learning and the integration of one's originality. It emphasizes that working without a desire to improve and innovate can lead to disillusionment and stagnation. The author emphasizes a need to pursue a profession as a \"flight of stairs\" that one ascends through learning and growth, rather than a road that leads to nowhere. In the last 200 tokens, the author suggests that in order to live fully, we need to explore our potential and organize our activity. They propose that we must learn to delegate tasks to those who are intellectually inferior to us and always strive to do better than what we are currently engaged in. The text reminds us that true fulfillment comes from expending everything we could have given in our work.",
  "content": "Working, acting, producing, this is what is needed by both the poet and the devotee of sensual pleasures, by the philosopher as much as by the winemaker, both for his own sake and for the sake of the world. We must learn the art of dreaming— that is indeed true —, but we must also master the art of exploiting our dreams productively. There is, then, yet another art we will need to grasp, namely, the art of delegating to those who are intellectually inferior to us the fulfilment of those exigencies which are merely a means and not a goal of our activity. We are called upon, in other words, to learn how to always judge whether we are not actually able to do something better, something more useful, of a higher level than what we are engrossed with, by simply entrusting to our subordinates the preoccupation of physically bringing us the bricks with which to construct the building. Whoever dies without having expended everything he could have given has lived in vain. In order, however, to live fully, we ought to probe our own selves and organize our activity.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to live a fulfilling life, we must learn to master the art of productive dreaming, delegate wisely, and constantly strive to improve ourselves and our work. By acting with bravery and organization, we can turn each day's work into a meaningful step towards our ultimate goals, making our daily lives more enjoyable and satisfying. Always remember that the conscious awareness of creating something useful or pleasant will make work cheerful and light."
