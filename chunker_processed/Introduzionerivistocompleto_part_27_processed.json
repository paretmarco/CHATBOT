  "title": "What is the Enneagram and how can it be used for personal and professional growth?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, the text dives into the enneagram as a tool for personal growth and understanding others. The author describes the nine personality types and how they communicate through different representational channels. They also analyze non-verbal communication and how it relates to values and emotions. Finally, the text delves into the characteristics and motivations of types four (The Individualist) and five (The Investigator). By understanding these personalities, we can improve communication and behavior strategies.",
  "content": "THE INDIVIDUALIST Thinking about love and emotions, they are attracted to the unachievable; their ideal is never “the here and now”. They are tragic and melancholic, artistic temperament and sensitive; they get stuck on long-distance love and on the loss of a friend. Developed type four live their lives creatively and they know how to help others in their suffering. They are devoted to beauty and passion, birth, sex, intensity, and death. Sometimes they seek out sufferance to better analyze it. They are very analytic and it is difficult for them to feel guilty. Their representation channel is COENEASTHESIS AUTIORY. Key Motivation: DON’T BE SUPERFICIAL; BE DEEP 5. THE INVESTIGATOR They are researchers, collecting information; “They stay in their ivory tower”. Their investment is in knowledge; in fact the motto that best describes them is “take care of the details”. They maintain emotional distance from others, protect their privacy, and do not allow themselves to get involved. They subdivide duties into compartments, being detached from people, feelings and things. Developed type five can cover decisional positions very well and become intellectuals. Their representational channel is AUDITORY COENEASTHESIS. Key Motivations: MULTI-KNOWLEDGED; WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING; KNOWLEDGE IS POWER! 6. THE LOYALIST They want to avoid danger and be influenced, reason on the intentions of others, and are critical from an intellectual point of view. They are timid, indecisive, procrastinator, for to them, thought substitutes action. They are frightened to act because exposing themselves may mean being attacked.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enneagram provides a powerful tool for understanding oneself and others on a personal and professional level. By recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of different personality types, we can communicate more effectively and work towards individual and collective development. Additionally, hypnosis offers a means of accessing transformational processes through powerful communication techniques. With practice and training, anyone can master these tools to achieve greater success and happiness in life. Remember, life changes when we change, and we have the power to shape our own stories."
