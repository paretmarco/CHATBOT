  "title": "\"How can men overcome their ego and focus on what truly matters for success?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens, the text explores the importance of avoiding excessive self-esteem and inner dialogue to overcome the burden of ego. The author reminds us that we are more than our internal dialogues, and focusing too much on the ego prevents us from seeing the world. Many people indulge in egocentric ideas, thinking of themselves as phenomenal creatures, which the author deems an utterly ridiculous concept. Instead, we must remind ourselves that we are just a drop of water, a grain of sand, a spark in a conflagration. By doing so, we can become present with ourselves and achieve success.",
  "content": "Overcoming the encumbrance of one’s own ego Greatness makes the body heavy (Tao Te King) What is especially important to avoid is excessive self-esteem and the exaggerated inner dialogue every one of us engages with his own self. We are, period. We are not all these internal dialogues of ours. Even the word “self” is an inappropriate one for defining our reality, which is indeed far vaster than this word. Focusing excessive attention on one’s own limited “ego” is what consumes mental energy the most. Hyper-attention which is directed at our own selves prevents us from seeing the world. Many people strut in this world with a superb demeanour and with pride, as if they deemed themselves phenomenal creatures. The egocentric idea becomes excessively infixed in many of us whenever we turn ourselves into the centre of the world, the focus of every glance, the goal of every attention. It is an utterly ridiculous concept, given that every man thinks the same of his own self. We must accordingly remind ourselves properly that we are like a drop of water, a grain of sand, a spark in a conflagration.",
  "last_phrase": "To attain true greatness, we must overcome the encumbrance of our own ego and adopt a more objective perspective. Excessive self-esteem and internal dialogue prevent us from seeing the world, while hyper-attention to the self consumes our mental energy. By not turning ourselves into the center of attention and focusing on external things, we can attain perfection and true success. Remember, our significance is minimal but that's precisely what makes it possible for us to accomplish a lot."
