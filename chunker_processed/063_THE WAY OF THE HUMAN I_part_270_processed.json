  "title": "How does the Fight/Flight Response Impact the Mind-Body Connection?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the concept of the body-mind connection is explored, and how the nervous system's fight/flight response has a significant impact on our psychological functioning. The author further delves into Quantum Psychology and how trances are the nervous system's attempt to order the chaos caused by a shock. The last 200 tokens explain that the body carries an internal memory and goes into a trance, causing reactions \"as if\" it were in danger. This is exemplified by someone with a phobia response to driving after a car accident. The text provides insightful information to better understand how the body and mind work together to shape our experiences.",
  "content": "When this occurs, the body itself cannot \"handle\" this stimulation and begins to dissociate, to split and/or separate from itself. The chaos (energy) which the dissociation attempts to order are unlabeled electrical responses in the nervous system which later become fear, anger, etc. With the shock (over-stimulation) of the emotional area, for example, comes the next dissociative attempt (to order the chaos), namely, the creation of thoughts, images, beliefs, values, etc. This could also explain the experience of opposing thoughts, i.e., the nervous system is in shock and electrically is opposing itself. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Trances are the Nervous System's attempt to order the chaos caused by a shock. Chapter VIII placing the \"needle\" into the same groove each time and producing the same song, regardless of the external present time context. In other words, the body carries an internal memory and goes into a trance. For example, imagine someone in a car accident who now has a phobia response to driving. Is the person experiencing present time driving? No. The body's nervous system is reacting \"as if\" it were in danger.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to heal from past traumas and break the biological-psycho trance, it is important to trace it back to the fight/flight response and understand that all of the body's attempts to create thoughts, beliefs, and mystical realms are intrinsic to its survival mechanism. By processing the false core and addressing the root cause of the trauma, one can begin to handle the chaos and overcome the dissociative patterns."
