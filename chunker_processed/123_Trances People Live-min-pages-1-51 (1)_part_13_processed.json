  "title": "How Does Trance State Impact Our Perception of Time and Choice?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author explores the concept of everyday trance states and how they can be harnessed for positive effect. In the final 200 tokens, the focus shifts to the more problematic aspects of trance, specifically in the case of someone experiencing anxiety. The individual in question is referred to as Mlle and is described as experiencing fear about a catastrophic future event. This fear is compounded by posthypnotic suggestions and negative hallucinations that further reinforce her belief that there is no solution to her predicament. The text suggests that such trance states can be deeply ingrained, forming patterns of defense that are difficult to break out of.",
  "content": "Driving along in the car, I hear a tune from 20 years ago and spontaneously age regress to a particular experience that is linked in my memory with that tune. Or, I am sitting in my favorite chair absorbed in a basketball game on TV and somehow manage not to hear a word that is said to me by my wife. Or, I look up from my desk where I have been hard at work for the past hour and glance outside, staring into the sky and the trees in a daydreamy, absorbing moment. These examples of Erickson's common everyday trance invol ye a non-symptomatic and transitory use of Deep Trance Phenomena. In addition to these kinds of light trance states that Erickson described and utilized in his work are trance states that function at the core of the symptom structure. As we will see in Chapter 2, these kinds of trances are created by the child in response to threat and become sources of pathology as they are integrated into the child's habitual mode of response. By the time we reach adulthood, we have intricate patterns of defense woven out of clusters of Deep Trance Phenomena that appear to function autonomously within us.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to better understand our habitual patterns of defense woven out of clusters of Deep Trance Phenomena that appear to function autonomously within us, it is important to determine whether the trance we are experiencing is part of the problem, part of the solution, or simply a fleeting experience. Mindfulness can help us make choices to effectively manage our state of consciousness and create positive outcomes."
