  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the importance of de-hypnotizing oneself through multi-dimensional awareness to achieve a state of \"no me\" through meditation. Prior to this, Nasudin replies to a passerby calling him out for beating a goat by stating that he does nothing, and the passerby mistakes him for an enlightened saint. The text then delves into the concept of uncooked seeds and how the nervous system's generalizing tendencies can cause them to resurface, giving an example of a client struggling with sexual repression due to past beliefs. Overall, the author emphasizes the need to address psychological and emotional issues to truly reach a state of meditation that liberates awareness.",
  "content": "She responded in the following ways: First, when she met a man she was turned on to, she treated him just like her husband, so there was no sexual charge. Second, she took medication to repress her sexual feelings. And, third, she held a past time concept of no sexual feelings being allowed outside of her marriage which further repressed her present time sexual feelings. 81 The Way of the Human • Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness MEDITATION AND UNCOOKED SEEDS You can get into a great state of meditation, but unless the psychological and emotional issues are really clear, you will immediately identify with your issues and move out of ESSENCE-1 AM NOT etc., We have all been hypnotized and, actually, the whole game is about becoming dehypnotized or \"getting,\" in the words of Nisargadatta Maharaj, that \"whatever you think you are—you are not.\" Quantum Psychology explores the liberation of awareness which is DE-HYPNOSIS. Someone asked me a question about meditation. \"Doesn't it help?\" Yes, meditation can lead to Samadh which means \"no me.\" But that awareness can rarely be stabilized as long as other dimensions are not looked at and gone beyond.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, it is important to acknowledge and work through psychological and emotional issues in order to truly achieve a state of meditation and awareness. Simply repressing or ignoring these issues may lead to temporary relief, but they will inevitably resurface. Only through de-hypnosis and exploring all dimensions can we achieve a true state of being."
