  "first_phrase": "In the previous sentences, we talked about a powerful energy that arises after being initiated. In this last part, Perceval meets the White Knight who personifies the danger of getting stuck in appearances and not looking inside oneself. The Knight watches the river, which represents the movement of love, and has been stuck there for 7 years. Perceval chooses to move forward and meets a beautiful woman, but a knight appears. This section examines the dangers of becoming stagnant in one's emotions and the importance of continuing to move forward in one's journey.",
  "content": "This man tells him the road. The snake that has been woken up is ENERGY. And a serpent is Cernunnos, the celtic God of the Vital force A serpent also we have in the caduceus, symbol of energy After the initiation, a new energy has been woken in us! ________________ The White Knight Very important is that an initiated knight doesn't let himself be absorbed by appearances. His double is not outside, but inside. In the Perceval the white knight is the symbol of it. He let himself get absorbed in thinking he was in love. Perceval meets the White Knight. He beats him.

But he is still there Do you want to stay there? No, because I understand that water moves, emotions go away. I don't want to direct my energy there. I want to go to a higher level. I will proceed further. ________________ Perceval continues and meets a beautiful woman. But a knight arrives.",
  "last_phrase": "As we reach the end of this journey, we must remember the importance of not being absorbed by appearances and letting our inner selves guide us. The initiation has awakened a new energy within us, symbolized by the serpent and the lake, which we must learn to harness. By meeting our double, represented by the White Knight and the Beautiful Unknown, we can begin to develop this energy and move towards a higher level of consciousness. As we move forward, we will delve deeper into new experiences and uncover the mysteries of the Temple of Solomon and the Graal."
