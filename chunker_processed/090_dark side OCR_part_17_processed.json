With love, Your brother, Stephen â€¢ 1 Where it All Began for Me For almost six years, I lived in a monastery in India. Before that, I conducted a private psychotherapy and training practice in Los Angeles, California. While in India it became apparent to me that meditation could be seen as an Eastern way of de-hypnotizing myself from my mental program, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and emotions. By de-hypnotizing myself I no longer felt compelled nor obsessed by the never ending chatter of the mind.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the process of awakening the observer and transcending the frozen states of the inner child is the real process of trance-ending. By de-hypnotizing ourselves through meditation and understanding the pervasive nature of trances, we can break free from the never-ending chatter of the mind and live more fully in the present moment. May you find joy and freedom in this journey. With love, Stephen."
