  "title": "\"How can we balance Chronos and Kairòs to maximize our daily opportunities and enjoy life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text talks about the importance of time and how it can be divided into two distinct phases - Chronos and Kairòs. Chronos is considered the planned time that helps in laying down the initial structure of an activity, whereas Kairòs is a time for energy and opportunities, enjoyment, and deriving the most that one can from life. The text emphasizes the importance of paying attention to one's primary commitment and working around it. And, it also motivates individuals to live every day as a complete self-contained moment.",
  "content": "You must clearly tell your selves, persuade your selves, that tomorrow does not exist. When tomorrow will be «today», tomorrow will have already turned into something else. Our life is only made up of many different «today’s». You live today. It is today that you are called upon to act. In order to clarify the point, we are going to say that the extent of categorical commitment which we succeed in practically carrying out during a day is what confers on that day an entrenched, absolute value within the folds of a chronology, and which in any event allows you to move towards the accomplishment of your ideal. Kairòs: You must also remember, however, that, apart from being able to find a daily outlet for actualizing your talents towards a specific purpose, you should take care of successfully living every day of yours as a complete self-contained moment. Every day is in fact endowed with its own peculiar value. Being a unit distinct as such from any other unit, it must consist in a work of harmony, of unity with our own selves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, remember that today is all we have and it holds its own unique value. Embrace each day as a self-contained moment that adds to the chronology of your life. While it's important to commit yourself to your ideal, it's equally important to find harmony within yourself and live life fully. Seize the opportunities presented to you, for they may lead to new paths in your journey."
