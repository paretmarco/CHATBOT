  "title": "\"Why are traumas so intense and hard to take apart? How does the collective unconscious and physics dimensions play a role in psycho-spirituality and the existence of the soul?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the collapsing of dimensions during a trauma was discussed. Now, in the last 200 tokens, the concept of Collective Unconscious is introduced. It contains the fundamental dimensions of physics and archetypes, including the I AM archetype, which is the key to our ruling forces lying outside awareness. We are then introduced to the NOT-I-I, where the WITNESS observes without any effect, and pure awareness is aware of the VOID, which is beyond dimensions. Finally, the concept of UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is discussed, which condenses into everything that exists, and will thin out to become VOID again.",
  "content": "At the same time, the WITNESS is pure awareness aware of the BIG EMPTINESS \"Behind it.\" Beyond this awareness is the VOID, where there is no-awareness or awarer. This is why the VOID, the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE and BEYOND are Not Dimensions. THE VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS: THE SOUL THING (VOLUME III) If you follow Buddhism, Buddha's realization was that there is no individual soul which transmigrates (incarnates) again and again. The VOID condenses down and becomes whatever. There is no individual separate self that incarnates. Instead the VOID con- denses down and becomes \"a thought\"—\"you,\" \"me,\" grandma, a feeling, Coca Cola, it doesn't matter. One day that VOID OF UN- DIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS will thin out and become VOID again. We call the condensing down of the VOID OF UN- am using the term \"physics dimensions\" to differentiate it from Quantum Psychology's dimensions of manifestation 53 The Way of the Human • Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness DIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS \"life,\" the thinning out of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS \"death.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS is a fundamental concept in Buddhism and Quantum Physics, where the individual self is an illusion and everything is made of the same substance. Understanding this can lead to a greater sense of interconnectedness and ease in navigating life's transitions."
