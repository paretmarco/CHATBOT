  "title": "\"What is the Power of the Eye in Fascination? How can it be used for Personal Growth and Therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, the focus is on the power of the eye and how it can be harnessed to achieve remarkable results. The author introduces Virgilio T. 2, the last custodian of the secrets of an ancient school of fascination, who has been gradually revealing his knowledge to the author over a period of twenty years. The text explores the historical and scientific sources of fascination and the ability to communicate different messages through the gaze. It also delves into how conscious awareness can help subjugate the energies possessed by the look, ultimately leading to the power to enchant and create instantaneous hypnosis.",
  "content": "During a series of subsequent meetings, spread over a period in excess of twenty years, he has gradually introduced us to the strange and arcane power of the gaze, and has passed onto us increasingly more mysterious and secret exercises. The first one to meet him was actually a friend of mine, Max, who, having approached him in order to seek information on what hypnotism was, received a very practical reply to his inquiry. Virgilio T., who at that stage worked as a barber, asked those who were present at the barber’s shop whether they agreed to take part in an experiment. Once he received a positive reply to his said request, he closed the door of the shop and firmly fized his gaze on one of the customers, who had moreover assumed a somewhat defiant look. His defiant posturing only lasted for a very short period. Within a few seconds, in fact, that customer took on a livid appearance. Virgilio told him that the cigarette was bad. The customer thus addressed began to cough so much that Virgilio was forced to slap him in the face a few times in order to bring him back to his senses. When it came to the second customer, he did not even utter a single word to him. He fixed him closely, and this other customer’s look turned pallid and diaphanous as if it was made of wax.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of fascination through the gaze is ancient and beneficial, though often shrouded in secrecy. By training and mastering the art of fixation and self-control, one can develop the ability to captivate and influence others. This technique has practical applications in daily life, therapeutic fields, and personal growth. However, it is essential to understand the responsibility and ethical implications of using this power. With discipline and consciousness, one can unlock the potential of the gaze and unlock new doors in life."
