  "title": "What is the power of the eye and how can it be used to influence others?",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the power of the gaze and its potential to influence and even hypnotize others. The author, who is also the speaker, discusses the ancient practice of fascination and its correlation to modern quantistic physics. They trace their interest in the subject back to their encounter with Virgilio T. 2, the last known custodian of the secrets of fascination in Piedmont. The author provides a comprehensive study of the power of the eye and offers practical exercises to develop it. The final 200 tokens recount the author's firsthand experience with Virgilio's mysterious and secret exercises.",
  "content": "During a series of subsequent meetings, spread over a period in excess of twenty years, he has gradually introduced us to the strange and arcane power of the gaze, and has passed onto us increasingly more mysterious and secret exercises. The first one to meet him was actually a friend of mine, Max, who, having approached him in order to seek information on what hypnotism was, received a very practical reply to his inquiry. Virgilio T., who at that stage worked as a barber, asked those who were present at the barber’s shop whether they agreed to take part in an experiment. Once he received a positive reply to his said request, he closed the door of the shop and firmly fized his gaze on one of the customers, who had moreover assumed a somewhat defiant look. His defiant posturing only lasted for a very short period. Within a few seconds, in fact, that customer took on a livid appearance. Virgilio told him that the cigarette was bad. The customer thus addressed began to cough so much that Virgilio was forced to slap him in the face a few times in order to bring him back to his senses. When it came to the second customer, he did not even utter a single word to him. He fixed him closely, and this other customer’s look turned pallid and diaphanous as if it was made of wax.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of the gaze, also known as fascination, has been used for centuries in various fields such as everyday life, therapeutic healing, and personal growth. Through discipline and self-control, one can train their eyes to become a powerful tool for persuasion and enchantment. While this technique may seem mysterious and arcane, it can be learned and mastered through specific training and exercises. It is essential to remember that the use of fascination should always be pursued for positive purposes, and with the necessary caution."
