  "title": "What are the practical methods for achieving goals using time and mind power?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, we will explore powerful practical methods for achieving our desired outcomes. These methods include the method of the light, self-magnetism, Indian self-hypnosis, and a general method of mental attitude. The exercises presented do not require a specific time factor, as they are designed to work in a dimension where time does not exist. However, it is important to fully understand the preceding chapters to maximize the benefits of these methods, and to develop the necessary qualities and aptitudes for success. As the saying goes, any number multiplied by zero will always yield zero as the final result. Achieving our objectives is like constructing a building, beginning with the power of pre-visualization and the voluntary erection of our destiny.",
  "content": "It is only by acquiring consciousness of something that we might be able to lift ourselves above that thing and thereby master it. It follows that you will maximize your gains only if you have firmly grasped and applied what has been written in the preceding pages of this book. In fact, the techniques we are about to observe now are like multipliers, able as such to multiply the results you are going to achieve manifold times. Let us however remember, at the same time, that any number multiplied by zero will always yield zero as the final result! Put it differently, if your car is left without fuel or you are not conversant with how to drive, knowing the shortcut will be of no avail to you. Begin, therefore, by developing, to their maximum possible extent, the qualities and aptitudes which have been pointed out in the previous chapters, as they are endowed with a fundamental significance. The power of pre-visualization The voluntary erection of each personâ€™s destiny, the perfecting of our qualities, and the attainment of our objectives, might be jointly compared to the construction of a building.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, to achieve your desired outcomes, it's crucial to internalize and practice what you've learned in the preceding pages. The techniques discussed here are like multipliers but are useless without the necessary foundational qualities and aptitudes. Focus on the purpose behind your activity, practice self-fascination, and self-magnetism, but also remember that without energy and true understanding, they will be of little help."
