  "title": "How can the use of mirrors lead to higher states of consciousness and initiation into supreme mysteries?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text provides a step-by-step guide to an interesting practice with mirrors that can help one become more aware of different levels of consciousness. The author describes four stages of this practice, which involve using a mirror to develop one's ability to perceive reality in increasingly refined ways. The author also discusses some of the basic principles that are fundamental to this practice, such as the importance of staying present and maintaining a sense of awareness. Additionally, the author mentions another exercise that can be done in the dark to develop the ability to see forms with closed eyes.",
  "content": "Apart from the exercise with the mirror there is also another exercise that is very useful to be done apart from a few hours: standing, in a room perfectly dark, with the eyes closed, concentrate your mind trying to recall the experience above and trying to recreate the various psychophysiological reactions; whilst keeping the eyes open one may see some forms appear, sometimes brighter, and this appearing will be more precise as the ability develops. Later it will be also possible to develop the vision with closed eyes. FIRST PHYSICAL PHENOMENA - FIRST STAGE (? Earthly phenomena) The phenomena that you may begin to notice in practice with the mirrors are various. Stare at yourself on the third eye, where the nose touch the forehead, or, and some of the phenomena will appear faster, in the left eye. At the begin, a fog will appear around the image. The fog on the image reflected in the mirror slowly will become more dense after total and then goes darkening. After it will change its quality again taking a milky colour - at the beginning it will be just like a sensation - but after you will hawe a strange complete darkness where you will anyway see the boundaries of physical objects, surrounded by a strange light that could cover all ranges of the iris, from red to violet, with shades and tints unimaginable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the practice of gazing into a mirror with focused intention can lead one on a journey of self-discovery and expansion of consciousness. The journey involves different stages, including physical phenomena, visions, dreams, and lucid dreaming in a waking state. Various exercises can be practiced to overcome self-limiting beliefs and reach transcendental states of being. However, it is important to proceed with caution and seek guidance from experienced practitioners to avoid potential dangers and pitfalls. With patience, discipline, and a willingness to explore beyond the boundaries of the self, one can reach the ultimate goal of cosmic consciousness."
