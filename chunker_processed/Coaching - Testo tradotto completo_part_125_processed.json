  "content": "The disappearance of one’s limiting inner dialogue The mind’s useless self-talk is one of the main forms of energy dispersion. These internal dialogues are often mere instances of internalization of commands and words that have been heard in one’s young age or from other persons: “Take care to …”, “do not do …”, etc. So long as our mind is replete with these inward dialogues, we will never be able to be free. No doubt the eradication of all useless thoughts is not easy to accomplish, but it is at least easy to reduce them by no more than 10%, as that alone will cause you to live better. The exercises based on bodily awareness guide our attention to a dimension of ourselves which is more directly sensory and more far-reaching in its effectiveness. As for stilling our internal dialogue, it helps us conquer the castle of words which erect our negative beliefs, our restricting thoughts. Bit by bit, we will understand that they are no more than automatic reflexes and words, and we will establish contact with a more comprehensive inner dimension.",
