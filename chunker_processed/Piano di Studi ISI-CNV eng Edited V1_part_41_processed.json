  "content": "Campanelli’s fame, punctuated by astounding results and corroborated by unimpeachable testimonies, appears to be truly unassailable. His is an unbelievable, amazing, unparalleled case, which has been studied by worldwide famous scientific celebrities, who have analyzed the phenomenon of his person and sealed their reports by stating the following: <<The relevant facts are true, and yet they are devoid of any plausible explanations in terms of ordinary therapeutic techniques>>2. Formerly an advocate practicing from his study in central Rome and an inveterate smoker, Campanelli, following a meeting with Hermann Michel, was so impressed by the fact he had succeeded in quitting smoking that he wanted to learn Michel’s magnetic and hypnotic techniques. He eventually became, in his own right, a healer specialized in removing the bad habit of smoking from fellow humans. The roster of his patients, both Italians and foreigners, include the following: The winner of the Nobel Prize for peace Shimon Peres, King Hussein of Jordan, Margareth von Trotta, Maurizio Costanzo, Mariangela Melato, Bruno Zevi, Margherita Boniver, and Maurizio Ferrara. Fascination and Hypno-Magnetism: dr Paret is a disciple of Prof. Erminio Di Pisa. Prof. Erminio di Pisa was a person marked by exceptional charm and energy.
