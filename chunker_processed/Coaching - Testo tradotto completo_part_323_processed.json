  "title": "How can we establish a connection with our own body and achieve inner harmony in relationships?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of having a clear connection with ourselves in order to make beneficial decisions regarding our body and relationships. Prior access to the inward \"sense\" of our body is necessary to make the right choices. The author also emphasizes the need to create positive life habits and visualize the benefits of following them. In this final part, we see how the ability to lean on our unconscious during human contact leads to natural and educated spontaneity, as we focus on the purpose of the encounter rather than our status.",
  "content": "The same thing is going to apply to one’s relationships with other people. Human contact is a natural activity, and the greater our ability to lean on our unconscious, the better will be the results we are ultimately going to harvest. You should for instance know how to draw back during exchanges of opinion and thus create silence within yourselves. These moments will be used so as to stay in touch with a state of inner harmony as well as harmony with one's interlocutors over and above the said mutually divergent opinions. We will then display what is termed “spontaneity”. Besides, that will consist in a natural and educated form of spontaneity, insofar as it will be also linked to an enduring desire to have a relationship with the other. In that manner, we will know how to express ourselves, without asking ourselves such useless questions as to whether we are being the dominant force or the one that is being dominated. We will be rather focusing on the purpose of the encounter with such other person.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing our ability to lean on our unconscious mind can not only benefit our personal growth but also enhance our relationships with others. By drawing back during conversations, focusing on the purpose of the encounter, and displaying a natural form of spontaneity, we can achieve inner harmony and connection with our interlocutors. It is crucial to predetermine our actions and carry them out perfectly, with minimal involvement from our brain's higher centers. This way, we can tap into our cerebral unconscious and achieve a state of inspiration, leading to effortless and effective communication with those around us."
