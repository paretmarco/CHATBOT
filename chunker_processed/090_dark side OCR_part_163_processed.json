  "title": "\"How does creating confusion help with feelings of powerlessness, and what are the potential consequences?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking conclusion, the author explores the creative genius of Erickson, a man who utilized his own trauma-induced confusion to help empower others. However, when the creation of confusion becomes automatic, the individual can experience feelings of isolation and loneliness. The text delves into the inner child's trance, which can ultimately leave the person feeling out of control. The author presents a way to handle confusion by allowing oneself to be fully confused and coordinating it with breathing and body awareness.",
  "content": "One patient would always confuse his parents and impact his environment and relationships to gain a sense of control. People who feel they must always be one-up, subtly placing others one- down, suffer from this trance. It is the resistance to feeling powerless or one-down that the child within the adult finds abhorrent. There- fore, to not feel one-down, the strategy of creating confusion is employed. A confusion approach can work, but loneliness is a high price paid for control, particularly when the devices are so imbed- ded in the child within the adult, who no longer experiences choice. This protective trance is automatic and out of the person's control. The adult suffering from this inner child' s trance does not know why he turns people off. This is the power of the trance of the inner child. The Next to Handling Confusion I. Allowing the confusion. The first approach involves allowing yourself to be fully confused, and continue to feel and create the con-fusion. What is paramount in this process is (1) continue breathing and notice where or what part of the body feels tight, and (2) tighten the body and coordinate it with the holding of breath.",
  "last_phrase": "To break free from the cycle of confusion and control, it is essential to allow yourself to experience and differentiate the confusion. By intentionally embracing the confusion and noticing it in the body, you can gain a new perspective and become the observer rather than the victim of the inner child's trance. Through conscious awareness and differentiation, you can regain control and break the cycle, paving the way for deeper, more authentic connections with yourself and others."
