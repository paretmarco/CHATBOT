  "first_phrase": "This text provides guidance on a meditation technique that helps individuals focus on a specific idea they want to materialize. The technique requires individuals to concentrate on the idea while assuming a specific physical posture, and then remove their hands from their head and rub their palms together to polarize the suggestive fluid that irradiates from their brain. Finally, individuals are asked to rub their palms and pass them over their chest to homogenize the sensations even by the heart. Following these steps can help individuals materialize their desired attitude or physical or spiritual qualities.",
  "content": "Through that path, you will be able, by this side of your body, to polarize the suggestive fluid which irradiates from your brain in the course of this operation. There is no need to pass the hand on the limbs in any hard manner. It will be sufficient, for that purpose, to simply graze them, or even to keep your hand at a distance of one or two millimetres from any such limb, occasionally touching it. The important aspect consists in the fact that the mind should not lose its focus during the material action. Rub the palms of your hands once more, and then, with the palm of your left hand, switch to the right side of your body. The Heart Rub the palms of your hands again, and then, keeping your hands crossed on each other, let them pass over your chest for about 1-2 minutes. This will have the effect of homogenizing the sensations even by the heart, which is the hub of your own beings.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through the simple yet focused actions described, you can polarize your entire being and activate your connection with the infinite. Remember to keep your mind focused during the material action, homogenize sensations by rubbing your heart and belly, and enter a state of absence of thoughts to fully reap the benefits of this exercise."
