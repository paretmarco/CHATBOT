  "content": "Erickson had a strong personality making a powerfull impression on his clients; but a powerful personality is just a matter of non-verbal communication; using a multisensory induction we can get the client in the same state of mind that a \"strong personality\" creates, and this because he will be involved emotionally in in the situation. USE OF NON VERBAL ELEMENTS IN SELLING Selling means getting the client emotionally involved in the possible use of a product; utilizing non verbal elements we can involve emotionally a client in the situation he is living and in what we are saying. The same approach we use in hypnosis we can use in selling. NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION AND SUBMODALITIES Through the right non-verbal communication we will change the submodalities of the internal representations of the client; and for this reason we will be able to do submodalities work easier and faster.
