  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discussed the practice of identifying and observing one's trances, leading to a realization that we are not our seemingly automatic responses. This concept is particularly relevant to age regression, a Deep Trance Phenomenon that affects most people. Age regression causes adults to unconsciously regress to behaviors that worked for them in the past. This often results in a feeling of powerlessness and alienation within one's personal relationships. In the last 200 tokens, the author elaborates on how age regression affects people and their relationships, and how identifying one's trances can help regain control in these situations.",
  "content": "If only for 30 seconds after being reprimanded by a boss, spouse, or friend, we all know how it feels to cascade back in time psychologically and emotionally. The young wife who curls up on her husband's lap to entice him into buying her a new dress is the same little girl who first Learned to crawl onto Daddy's lap and \"be cute\" in order to get what she wanted. Age regression grants the little girl of yesteryear the automatic response of using what worked for her in the past in present time. The problem is that the adult in present time automatically and unknowingly age regresses to get what she wants. Often, she feels powerless and resents the lack of respect she receives from her partner. She might feel misunderstood, unseen, and even alienated. All these psychoemotional states are glued together by an unknowing adult utilizing age regression. T Age regression is probably the most widely experienced Deep ranee Phenomenon and almost always a contributor in the present- ing problem or symptom.",

Recognizing when we are reverting to past behaviors and patterns can be the first step in breaking free from the cycle and developing healthier coping mechanisms.
