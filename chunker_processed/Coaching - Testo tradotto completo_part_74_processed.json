  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of having a clear and defined aim in all activities to achieve effectiveness and success. It emphasizes the need to eliminate mentally superfluous information and organize one's activity around a demarcated aim for self-improvement and increased power. The author notes that scholars and those who navigate the internet without a specific purpose often succumb to cerebral vagrancy, dilating and scattering their efforts. This last part focuses on the problem of working towards a non-tangible purpose and the subsequent enlargement of scope that hinders progress towards the original aim.",
  "content": "Knowing how to aim at a specific target and to precisely delineate it Let us now speak of a problem that is frequently encountered: When one works towards accomplishing a purpose which is not immediately tangible, when, for example, one is studying a particular issue, what occurs is that, due to the concatenation of ideas, although we do not actually exit the ambit of that subject-matter, we nevertheless enlarge its scope to such an extent that we can no longer perceive its demarcating boundaries: What is accessory turns into the main aspect, and it in turn creates further ancillary investigations, and so on and so forth. What is occasioned thereby is a new kind of cerebral vagrancy which scholars are not cognizant of. They lack awareness of such cerebral roving because, though they believe they are deepening their devotion to the particular subject they are with busy with, they are in actual fact dilating and thus scattering it. That is also what often happens to the person who navigates through the Internet without any precise purpose; one page summons another one, and, at the end of the day, nothing has been done and nothing has been achieved.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to avoid widening the horizons of our academic pursuits beyond measure and to prevent aimless surfing on the internet, it is crucial to know how to identify and target specific objectives, set them within a time frame, and work towards achieving them exhaustively. This focused approach not only ensures productive outcomes but also affords us free time to pursue superfluous researches without succumbing to cerebral vagrancy."
