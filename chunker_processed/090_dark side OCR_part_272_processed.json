  "title": "\"How can you use sensory techniques to shift your experiences and deepen your sense of self?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the focus was on disconnecting from unpleasant experiences by choice. The last 200 tokens discuss techniques to spread and handle sensations, particularly in sexual encounters. These techniques involve suggesting that sensations can move and be felt as spaces between them, resulting in a deeper sense of connection with oneself. This practice is aimed at reaching successive plateaus of stimulation, deeper experience of self and an enhanced sense of reunion. The focus remains on increasing energy and achieving a deeper sense of connection, rather than immediate orgasm.",
  "content": "170 The Dark Side of the Inner Child Sexual Tantra If sensations during sexual contact are experienced in a local- ized area (the genitals, mouth, breasts), the same spreading technique can be employed by allowing the sensations (in penis or clitoris) to spread through the entire body. Sex then becomes a means to enhance and increase energy throughout the entire system (body). The focus of attention and the inner absorption creates a reconnection of genitals to body that promotes a deeper sense of self. If this practice is continued, the utilized energy created through sexual contact allows successive plateaus to be reached, creating a deeper experience of self. It cannot be over-emphasized that this process requires the intention to not orgasm immediately but rather to increase the stimulation to bring about a deeper sense of connec- tion and orgasm. 5. Spaces between sensations: In handling pain, as mentioned before, the sensations are felt as one experience. The first set of suggestions involves requesting that, rather than one long sensa- tion, there be a sensation and then a space or gap, and then a sensation, and then a space. Usually what occurs is a throbbing feeling.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, utilizing techniques such as spreading of sensations throughout the body and regulating the spaces between painful sensations can lead to a deeper sense of self-connection and healing. The classical approach of mentally marking off painful areas can also be effective for acute pain. By practicing intention and mindfulness during sexual encounters, we can enhance our energy and experience a more profound sense of self."
