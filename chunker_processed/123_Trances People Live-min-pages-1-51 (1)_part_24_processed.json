  "first_phrase": "In the penultimate section of the text, the author delves into the concept of love trance - a type of trance that couples often fall into during moments of conflict and reconciliation. The author describes how partners regress into a dependent, childlike phase and make posthypnotic suggestions to each other. They also experience pseudo-orientation in time and may even distort their sense of time during the trance state. Prior to this, the author discusses reactions as trance states that are often created unintentionally during moments of emotional turmoil.",
  "content": "You both reassert your couplehood (identity trance — more on that later) and take comfort in your internal pictures of walking down the street together hand-in-hand , being responded to as a couple in restaurants, sharing one cred it card and buy ing househo Id items together (pseudo- orientation in time). You may also experience some degree of time distortion in your love trance as time seems to stand still or disappear entirely. This is not to say that all our moments of love are encumbered by trance states that take the experience out of present time and burden it with \"unfinished business.\" However, such \"pure\" ex- periences of love (in I lindu literature it is called prem; in Western culture it is currently referred to as \"unconditional love\") are fairly A Day In The Life Of A Trtnice • 15 Reactions as Trance States Reactions are trance states when they happen to us — which is more Often than not.

We don't usually experience ourselves as consciously, intentionally creating our reactions, especially when any degree of emotional valence is involved.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to recognize the trance states that can occur in our experiences of love and relationships. By understanding and becoming less identified with our reactions, we can create more genuine and fulfilling connections with our partners. Remember to take comfort in the shared experiences and moments that strengthen your bond, but also remain present in the present moment to avoid getting lost in what could be."
