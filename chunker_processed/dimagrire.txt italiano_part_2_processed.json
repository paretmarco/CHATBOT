First, the therapist needs a full-body picture of the patient before the initial consultation. The author suggests that the patient must walk three kilometers a day before meals and check their weight daily. Once under hypnosis, the therapist will suggest they eat slowly, chew their food, and feel satisfied. They will no longer have the desire to eat more than necessary, and their weight will decrease gradually. The average number of sessions is from seven to nine.",
