  "title": "\"What are the ideas about 'I' and how can we reverse our concept of self and emptiness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this conversation between Paula and Wolinsky, they delve into the concept of the self as it relates to emptiness and the \"I.\" Paula discusses the idea that the \"I\" has about itself, which is the belief in its own existence. Wolinsky challenges Paula to see the self in a different light and consider the idea that emptiness is actually part of the self. Through therapeutic techniques, they work to break down these concepts and explore the relationship between the self and the void.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:Okay, so notice that the \"I\" decided that the \"I\" is me and that EMPTINESS was \"NOT me.\" Are \"you\" still deciding that? Paula:No, there is an \"I\" and a \"Not I\" out \"here.\" Wolinsky:Now, decide that the NOT-1 EMPTINESS IS ME and that the \"I\" is not me. Paula:It's rather interesting. Wolinsky:How are you doing? Paula:Good. Wolinsky:Let's go onto Therapeutic Note Without using your thoughts, memory, emotions, associations or perceptions, at some point there was an emergenceâ€”q-dentification that the EMPTINESS was not me and this \"I\" was me, i.e., the \"I love myself, etc. All we are doing is pulling out the ideas and concepts that are being held around the \"I\", looking at it until it disappears There is a cosmic superimposition whereby you become \"I\" and VOID becomes \"NOT I,\" so we are reversing the process. 185 Chapter IV Wolinsky:Good.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, exploring the concepts of \"I\" and \"emptiness\" can be an interesting and useful tool for self-discovery and personal growth, but it's important to remember that ultimately, these are just ideas and concepts. It's up to us to decide what we believe, but we should also be open to the possibility of letting go of these ideas and discovering a deeper truth beyond them."
