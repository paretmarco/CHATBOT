  "title": "What is the Quantum Psychology principle and how does it relate to the body and awareness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Quantum Psychology Principle of substituting psychological wants for biological needs was discussed. In the last 200 tokens, the text explores two other major biological have-toâ€™s - the merger response and the learning response. Thwarting these responses leads to deprivation and shock. The dimension of manifestation that encompasses animal nature, including the desire to merge and learning at the level of complexity, is the body. Loss of awareness of the body leads to dissociation and corresponding loss of potential for stabilization. The text also reiterates the pivotal role of the biological dimension in all eight dimensions.",
  "content": "You could say to her \"I hate you,\" or \"I'd like to kill you,\" and she would say, \"Oh, thanks very much, I hope it is nice day for you.\" She had no real awareness of her thinking, emotional, biological or external dimensions. She was split off and dissociated from those dimensions. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: With the splitting-off and dissociation from any dimension, there is a corresponding loss of the present time body and of the potential for stabilization in the underlying unity. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If you lose awareness of your body, you lose the external dimension. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: Psychology is caused by a dissociation from the biology (to be discussed later in the section on the BIOLOGICAL CORE). The biological dimension is pivotal because it is the cornerstone of all eight dimensions. If there is no body, there is no external 128 Chapter VIII world, no thinking world, no emotional world, no biological world, no ESSENCE, no I AM, No Awareness of the Archetypes of the COLLECTIVE, and no \"Not-I-I\". THE BASICS At this juncture, let us review several basic Quantum prin- ciples: 1.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's crucial to maintain a connection with all dimensions of ourselves, including the body, to stabilize our underlying unity. By dissociating from any aspect of ourselves, we risk losing access to our potential and the external world. Remember the basic Quantum principles, such as our body being a condensed void consciousness, to better understand and connect with all aspects of ourselves."
