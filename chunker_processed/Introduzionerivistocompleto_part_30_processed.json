You’re OK if you are suffering emotionally. TYPE 5 (INVESTIGATOR) I’m OK if I have information. You’re OK if you don’t invade me. TYPE 6 (LOYALIST) Recognize their abilities. Look for their good points. They aren’t bad but attack out of fear. TIPO 7 (ENTHUSIAST) Fill me up!!!!! I want to live positive emotional states! Give me new possibilities. Fear remaining stuck. TYPE 8 (CHALLENGER) Give them a responsibility. TYPE 9 (PEACEMAKER) Let me take part!!!!!!!!!!!!! As well as being able to recognize ourselves in one of the nine different enneagram types, the enneagram can also be used as a communication tool. ENNEAGRAM FOR COMMUNICATING The first thing we should do is OBSERVE our interlocutor in all of his/ her behaviors to be able to identify the enneagram type s/he belongs to. This allows us to understand the reasons behind his/ her behavior and eventual difficulties that we may meet, allowing us to pull out his/ her values. Thus, we can enter into a rapport without risk of doing or saying anything that makes us go on a “collision course”. It is, therefore, evident that the enneagram can be used both on personal and professional levels.",

Ultimately, by mastering these tools, we can become the architects of our own lives and create the reality that we desire."
