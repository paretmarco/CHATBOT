  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the eight dimensions of manifestation that will be explored throughout the trilogy. The first dimension is the external dimension in which external objects and people exist. The second dimension is the thinking dimension, the third is the emotional dimension, and the fourth is the biological or animal dimension. The final two dimensions are the fifth dimension, which is essence, and the sixth dimension, which is the \"I am\" state beyond definitions of self. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves further into the topic of the sixth dimension and its relationship to the false core-self.",
  "content": "There is a thinking world which appears to be inside of \"you.\" The Thinking Dimension includes thoughts, images, memories, associations, concepts, values, beliefs etc. 19 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness The Third Dimension is THE EMOTIONAL DIMENSION. This dimension includes sadness, anger, fear, etc. The Fourth Dimension is THE BIOLOGICAL OR ANIMAL DIMENSION. This dimension is your basic biological animal nature, which is part of your nervous system and also represents survival. It includes eating, sleeping, going to the bathroom, having sex, the fight/flight, survival mechanism, including merger-separation and learning. The Fifth Dimension is ESSENCE (see Volume III). ESSENCE is the spaciousness that your physical body organizes around and when realized becomes the FULLNESS of ESSENCE, containing \"essential qualities\" like love with no object, observation with no object, peace, compassion, etc. The Sixth Dimension is I AM (see Volume III) which is prior to the qualities of ESSENCE. The verbal I AM precedes the False Core-False Self; it is prior to I AM (fill in the blank), and before any definition of self.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing multi-dimensional awareness can help us understand the different aspects of our being, including our thoughts, emotions, biological nature, and deeper qualities like love and compassion. By becoming aware of these dimensions and our true essence, we can transcend the limitations of our false self and tap into the infinite potential of our being."
