Sounds, breathing, and non-verbal codes can be introduced to induce a trance state. Hypnodrama can be used to evoke emotional reactions and create a self-crisis. Magnetic points and fluidification can help address specific problems. The use of suggestion and understanding different magnetic types can also enhance the effectiveness of hypnosis. With practice and dedication, hypnosis can be a powerful tool to help individuals achieve their desired outcomes."
