  "title": "How does conscious awareness affect our view on professional work and economic aspirations?",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, the economic aspect of professional work and its relation to happiness is explored. The section emphasizes that while wealth can enable us to fully taste life, economic aspirations vary from person to person based on their capacity to enjoy. The text also highlights the importance of disinterested activity and developing the spirit as a means of personal evolution. The concepts of economic aspirations and disinterested activity are contextualized within the framework of the previous text.",
  "content": "It is true inasmuch as wealth, or at least a state of material comfort, can alone enable one to fully taste life, which, conversely, is so monotonous and painful for the indigent people; it is at the same time false, because wealth has no fixed boundary, such that one either moves from unhappiness to happiness or turns from happy to happier depending on whether or not he has crossed it. From an economic point of view, the happy person is he who owns sufficient means to appease his range of appetites. Each one of us has a specific capacity to enjoy, which is limited by oneâ€™s physical constitution, age, temperament, and mental inclinations. The fiery, active temperaments which manifest themselves positively are in general in greater need of money than the passive, submissive and contemplative temperaments. Development of soul and spirit Moving back to the sphere of intellectual activity, it is worth discussing in this context, in addition to one's professional activity, which we have already hinted at, the so-called disinterested activity, i.e. activity of our choice and activity devoted to developing the spirit. If we want to evolve, we must become enriched in our spirit.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, while material wealth can definitely provide a level of comfort, it has no ultimate boundary and cannot guarantee lasting happiness. However, by engaging in disinterested intellectual activity and focusing on self-enrichment, we can develop our spirit, generate useful ideas, build wealth, and establish meaningful connections with others. Finding and nurturing our preferred intellectual activities can become a refuge and a source of pure satisfaction, leading to a more fulfilling and richer life."
