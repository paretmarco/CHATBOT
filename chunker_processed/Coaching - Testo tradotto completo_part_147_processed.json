  "first_phrase": "This text emphasizes the importance of treating everyone as equals, respecting individuality and avoiding outbursts of anger by calmly defining relationships. It advises to avoid turning one's profession, social position or beliefs into the center of one's being and refrain from speaking ill of others. The author stresses the need to understand philosophical reflections on uselessness of anger control emotions. In the last part (200 tokens), the text delves into how one can manage emotions as a means of personal growth. The text highlights the difference between average humans and individuals who work on themselves by controlling their emotions.",
  "content": "Do not turn your profession, your social position, your religious or political faith, into the centre of your being. One has to be first a man, and only then an officer or a sectarian adept. You should never speak ill of any person: This is indeed a “selfish” rule one ought to take into account. Do not express your opinion unless you have been solicited to do so. As for whatever you have no interest in, it is incumbent on you to leave the unwelcome role of the propagandist to somebody else. It is necessary, at this juncture, for you to clearly understand what is being put forward herein. The philosophical reflections on the uselessness of anger and emotion must be firmly etched in our mind, in order for us to acquire a calm temperament. When, however, emotion supervenes, it is hardly possible to subjugate it by addressing it through nicely reasoned arguments. That which, however, differentiates the man who works on his own self from the average human being, is the length to which emotion is held back, and the manner in which it is managed. Emotion is a species of folly, or else a temporary intoxication of our nerves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, living a fulfilled life requires us to prioritize our humanity over our societal roles, to practice kindness and avoid speaking ill of others without being asked, and to avoid promoting things we have no interest in. We must also understand the uselessness of anger and emotion, and try to control them by restoring our nerves to their normal state through natural procedures, in order to achieve a calm and managed emotional state."
