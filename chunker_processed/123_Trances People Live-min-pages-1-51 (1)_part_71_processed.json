The author argues that there are key puzzle pieces present in both approaches, including trance states, interrupting patterns of response, and symptoms, but the differences arise in how they relate to each other. In the last 200 tokens, the author delves into the process of observing interpersonal contexts in therapeutic settings and draws upon their newfound knowledge to shed light on the fabric of daily human experience.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the role of trance states in symptomatology and therapeutic intervention is crucial. Rather than inducing a new trance state, working with the existing trance state that patients bring can facilitate change and unlock unconscious potentials. With the right techniques and approach, trance states can be a powerful tool for positive transformation and growth."
