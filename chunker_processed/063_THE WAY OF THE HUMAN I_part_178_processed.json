  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section of the text on Quantum Psychology, we delve into the emotional dimension of manifestation. Before this, we learned the dangers of imposing a philosophy on someone who cannot take it in and collapsing different dimensions. The author, Robert Anton Wilson, cautions against this and emphasizes the importance of developing multi-dimensional awareness. In this section, he explains how emotional states like anger, sadness, fear, and joy contribute to our manifestation. He also highlights how traumas can cause the collapse of different dimensions. The section ends with an example of a molestation trauma.",
  "content": "They are biological functions and when you imagine that abstaining 102 Chapter VI biologically will lead to the realization of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS, you are collapsing the levels. Each dimension has a function. It is important not to impose, overlap or try to overcome one dimension with another or oppose one dimension with another. Multi-Dimensional awareness is developing a functional awareness which is the freedom to have all of the dimensions or none of them. ' QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The greater the flexibility as to where \"you\" place your aware- ness, the greater the subjective experience of freedom. 103 The Way of the Human 9 Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness CHAPTER VII THE EMOTIONAL DIMENSION OF MANIFESTATION T he emotional dimension comprises our emotional states such as anger, sadness, fear, joy, etc. All of these are emotional states. When a trauma occurs, the reason a trauma is so severe and causes such a frozen and painful experience and fixates our awareness so intensely is because the different dimensions of manifestation fuse together. They collapse, merge and become one rather than being differentiated. Let's say that somebody was molested by Uncle Bob.",
  "last_phrase": "In developing multi-dimensional awareness, it is important not to collapse the different dimensions and functions of our being. Traumas can result in the fusion of our external, thinking, emotional, biological, and essence dimensions, leading to fixation, pain, and stagnation. However, we can transmute this energy by changing our state of mind and focusing our awareness on the present moment. By doing so, we can experience greater subjective freedom and a more functional awareness of our multi-dimensional existence."
