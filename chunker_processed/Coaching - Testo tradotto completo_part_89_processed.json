  "title": "\"How can being present and understanding our second brain improve relaxation and focus?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous passage, we learned that our intestines function as a second brain, linked to emotional memory and capable of signaling pain and joy. We also discovered the role of serotonin, called the \"neurotransmitter of wellbeing\", in our digestive system's everyday functions. In this final part, the author recommends a step-by-step relaxation technique for achieving self-mastery and extensive serenity. Moreover, the importance of concentration and being present in one's thoughts and actions are discussed, as it is believed that the human mind works best when it focuses on only one mental program at a time.",
  "content": "The last-mentioned method is quite effective and can also be made to accompany the abovementioned species of relaxation. It will take you to an ever increasing self-mastery, and to a state of more extensive serenity. Concentration All the prescriptive norms on relaxing useless tensions might be synthetically summed up in the under-stated sentence: Be present to what you do. Never do two things at the same time. One might even add the following caveat: Never host two different thoughts simultaneously. Unlike computers, the human mind is not multitasking. It can only externalize its full power if it lets only one mental program operate at any given time. Few are those who are capable of reading half a page without their minds interpolating two or three extraneous thoughts which are unrelated to the subject-matter of what is being read. Few are those who, in the course of a dialogue, have the ability to identify themselves with their interlocutors while the latter are busy talking We must learn how to be conscious and present in whatever we do. We come across a similar concept in Zen philosophy. This concept has its usefulness in everyday life.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving relaxation and self-mastery requires us to be present and fully engaged in the task at hand by focusing our thoughts and avoiding distractions. By applying the aforementioned method, we can increase our effectiveness, attain a state of serenity, and make the most of our mental powers. So, let us be mindful and give our full attention to every moment, activity, and interaction, and thereby enrich our daily lives."
