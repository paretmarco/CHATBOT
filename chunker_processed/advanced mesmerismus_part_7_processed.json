  "first_phrase": "This text is about advanced techniques of inducing ecstasy and deep trances in therapy. It includes topics such as magnetic nervous knots, the closure of senses technique, and learning the two techniques for realizing a magnetic state in a faster way. The exercises involve working on the spine, using music therapy, and even working with mirrors in pairs. The last part focuses on Magnetic Ecstasy, a technique used to create a physiological state at the end of a therapy session. The text also explains why only nine passes are needed and how to intercept and bind the magnetic force.",
  "content": "4 ° In the chest, horizontally with the point of vaccination. (Plexus cardiacus.) 5. A little above the stomach. (Plexus solaris.) 6 ° A little above the hips. (Ganglia lumbalia.) 7 ° In the groin. (Ganglia sacra and plexus hypogastricus.) 8 ° Above the knee. (Communicans tibialis.) 9 ° Under the soles of the feet. (Ramus volaris.) Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force? To intercept is to force the patient's interrupted magnetic current to retreat to the nearest nerve node. This is done by closing the hand so that the tips of the fingers touch the palm and the fingernails rest against the flesh.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, these exercises and demonstrations showcased the power of non-verbal hypnotherapy techniques that can be used to induce a state of trance and enhance suggestive communication. From the use of magnetic passes to the projection of videos, these methods aim to create a fluidic, magnetic state in the client to improve mental and physical health. With the introduction of the Trabona Method and modified Akstein Method, self-hypnosis becomes even more accessible. Overall, these techniques have practical applications in therapy and can help individuals achieve their desired outcomes."
