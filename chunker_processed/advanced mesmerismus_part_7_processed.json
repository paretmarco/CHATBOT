Note: you can also count a tenth at the top of the head - At what distance can the magnetic fluid be directed by a pass? Each magnetic pass conducts magnetic fluid only from one nerve node to another. . Why do you have to make no more than nine passes? The magnetic current only letting itself be directed by a pass from one node to another, so it will only be in the ninth pass that from the upper nerve node it will finally arrive at the last one, where we will always have care to bind and intercept the force. - What is intercepting and binding the magnetic force?

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, non-verbal communication plays a crucial role in hypnotherapy, and techniques such as the Magnetic Circle and Fluidification can be used to activate the parasympathetic system and stimulate inner reactions. The use of magnetic passes and opposite points in therapy can also have a positive impact. Suggestions should be given with conviction, confidence, and positivity, and the Hypnodrama method can be used to evoke emotional reactions. Additionally, moving therapy techniques like the Trabona and Modified Akstein methods with non-verbal hypnosis can benefit self-hypnosis. Magnetism can also be used for weight loss, and self-hypnosis with water is another technique worth exploring."
