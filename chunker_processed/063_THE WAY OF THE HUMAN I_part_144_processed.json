  "first_phrase": "In this 200-token segment, Stephen Wolinsky introduces the concept of the \"thinking world\" and the importance of balancing it with the external world. He explains that our beliefs, values, and decisions are all part of the thinking world, which also includes images and emotions. Unfortunately, people often favor one dimension of reality over the other, losing touch with the present moment. Wolinsky calls this going into a trance, which can lead to relating to an idea instead of a person. He references the father of General Semantics, Alfred Korzybski, to caution against confusing the map with the territory.",
  "content": "For example, we might be in a conversation with somebody, let's say a lover, and all of a sudden we go into a fantasy about their breaking up with us. That fantasy moves us from a present time relationship of the external dimension into our thinking dimension. We lose our present time reality. In Trances People Live: Healing Approaches in Quantum Psychology, I call that going into a trance and losing present time reality. What happens when we do that is we no 83 The Way of the Human * Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness longer see the person in present time, but rather we have, and relate to, an idea we have about them. We (the nervous system) infer and abstract, omitting certain things and selecting out others, becoming ultimately dominated by the thinking world over the present time experience of the external world. The noted father of General Semantics, Alfred Korzybski, would have said, \"The map is not the territory.\" In Quantum Psychology terms, this means you have an idea or an inference about the external world which is not the external world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential to maintain our present time reality instead of losing it to our thinking world. We should not be dominated by our thoughts and ideas about external circumstances, but rather have a holistic approach to the multi-dimensional universe. By doing so, we can avoid dissociation and loss of awareness, and consequently, maintain our humanness."
