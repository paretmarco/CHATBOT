  "title": "How Do Traders Engage in Negative Self-Hypnosis and Why Language Matters in Trading?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explains the importance of accepting losses in trading and avoiding negative self-hypnosis. The last 200 tokens focus on the effect of language on trading behavior. The author describes the use of words like \"difficulties\" and \"investment\" which contribute to negative self-talk and limit success. By replacing these words with less negative equivalents, traders can maintain a clearer mindset and avoid unnecessary obstacles. The text references the advice of Alexander Elder, who stresses the importance of accepting losses in trading.",
  "content": "For example, “difficulties” are only so because we call them that way. We can observe what happens when we begin to replace the word difficulty with such words as \"circumstance\" or \"fact\". “Difficulties” might be understood as no more than normal “situations” which are met along the path, and along the ordinary way in which one’s activity unfolds itself. As such, they are often capable of being solved by resorting to the logical type of reasoning we are perfectly able to carry out so long as we remain present. Another word which a trader uses so as to negatively hypnotize himself is the noun “investment”. When a certain stock does not yield gains, and yet the trader has a obstinately firm conviction that it is going to rise in value, he then calls it “an investment”. What should be done when, through our behaviour, we are unable to attain the goal we had initially set for ourselves? Whenever our conduct is incapable of achieving a demarcated intermediate objective, a difference is established between imagined reality and perceived reality, whereupon discomfiting hardships materialize.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to remember that difficulties or challenges are often simply normal situations that arise in the course of our activities. By reframing our language and thought patterns, we can approach these situations with a more logical mindset and ease the burden they may bring. When faced with unexpected challenges, it may also be necessary to adjust our expectations and strategies, taking into account new circumstances and experiences. Embracing a flexible, adaptive mindset can be a key factor in achieving success in any pursuit."
