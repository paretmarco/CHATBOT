  "content": "To collect into or to include a body.' 4 4mbody\" and \"embodiment,\" as directly related to conscious- ness, are two misunderstood terms in psycho-spiritual com- munities today.

We are then made to believe that this is true. Over the last 35 years, with the advent of the human potential movement, we have seen major attempts to correct this mis-perception. However, in order to do this we must look at and question many of the concepts we hold dear, such as the spirit or soul being separate from the body, or the body being separate from the underlying unity.
