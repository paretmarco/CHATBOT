  "title": "What are the paths and certifications offered by the Euro Asiatic Institute for Quantum Therapy Studies and how can one open a chapter in their country?",
  "first_phrase": "The final part of the text focuses on the practical applications of the techniques taught by the Euro Asiatic Network for research in Europe and Asia, specifically in the form of research and operative chapters. These chapters can be led by Mentors, who are individuals experienced and skilled in the techniques. The Master Research Project is also discussed, giving students the opportunity to pursue sustained research in the field, with the goal of spreading the techniques. The text concludes with the exploration of different paths for personal development, including the Magnetic Path and certifications in hypnoterapy and mesmerism. Additionally, the text discusses the possibility for individuals to create their own Magnetism branches, which can expand the \"magnetic chain\" and develop a deeper understanding of these practices.",
  "content": "Expanding our magnetic chain About the teaching of magnetism contained in our magnetic path, creating a branch or a chapter permits also to expand the “magnetic chain”. In quantum terms the “magnetic chain” is an entanglement between the members of a group. In fact we observe certain phenomena when more persons work together on some issue. These effects have been also studied and labeled as “morphic field”: \"The morphic fields include all kinds of organizing fields: The organizing fields of animal and human behaviour, of social and cultural systems, and of mental activity can all be regarded as morphic fields which contain an inherent memory.\" According to the essential uses, customs and traditions of Magnetism and most particular Hermetic orders, which have been scrupulously preserved by our lineage, a recognized branch has the power to make and develop teaching about magnetism, according to the lineages that we preserve and all groups that continue them are inside the so called \"magnetic chain\" and are to be considered as regular and develop this “inner memory”.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, expanding our knowledge of magnetism by creating dedicated chapters or branches can enhance the \"magnetic chain\" and entangle members of the group, resulting in significant outcomes. The Magnetic Path presents various techniques of magnetism, fascination, and quantum presence, offering a unique opportunity to understand and work with these forces of nature. The workshops and courses offer a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, enabling personal and professional growth, and leading to personal well-being. By adhering to the guidelines set for the group to be considered regular, the course also offers an international certificate. Moreover, the techniques of magnetic massage combined with Luxmind and Quantum Psi technologies add significant value to the course's practical application, leading to powerful therapeutic results."
