  "title": "\"What are the two types of emotional sensory distortion and how can they be addressed in therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author explores two types of sensory distortion: emotional and hypersensitive. In the emotional type, a 250-pound man disconnects and feels his body like a stone. Through therapy, he learns to lengthen or shorten the gaps between sensations, effectively taking charge of his sensations. In the hypersensitive type, a woman experiences rapid sensations in her heart and chest in groups of people, leading her to imagine others are thinking negatively about her. The author suggests creating sensations and taking charge of them to alleviate these distortions. Personalizing is also explored in this text, a cognitive therapy habit of relating everything to oneself.",
  "content": "Type II â€” Hypersensitive Distortion The second type of sensory distortion, hypersensitivity, is illustrated by a woman who felt hypersensitive in groups of people. She experienced rapid sensations in her heart and chest. As in the first type of sensory distortion, the speeding up or slowing down of sensations altered her subjective experience. She imagined people were thinking bad thoughts of her. Once again I asked her to create a sensation and notice the space, and create another sensation and Sensory Distortion + 119 notice the space. In this way, the observer took charge of creating the sensations. Another style of hypersensitivity comes from cognitive therapy and is called Personalizing. Personalizing is the tendency to relate everything around you to yourself. A recently married man thinks that every time his wife talks about tiredness she means she is tired of him. A man whose wife complains about rising prices hears the complaints as attacks on his ability as a breadwinner. A major aspect of personalizing is the habit of comparing yourself to others. He' s dumb, I'm smart. The underlying assumption is that your worth is questionable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to recognize the different types of sensory distortions, such as hypersensitivity, and how they can affect our subjective experiences. By taking charge of creating sensations and avoiding personalizing habits, we can better understand and interpret our experiences, reducing unnecessary stress and anxiety. Remember to always consider the bigger picture and not jump to conclusions based on personal assumptions."
