  "title": "\"How can we understand our desires and experience them as energy to avoid pain and resistances?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the concept of desire is explored. It is described as the act of wanting something earnestly and can occur at any point in a child's development. The text notes that infants and young children often desire to relieve physical pain or to feel close to others. However, desire can also be equated with resistance, as wanting something often means resisting something else. This can result in substituting one pain reliever for another, leading to further problems. Before discussing desire, the text explains the importance of slowing down and savoring one's food, focusing on the delightful feelings rather than the object of delight.",
  "content": "Desire can occur at any point in a child's development. For example, notice that with an infant or a young child, most of their wanting is to relieve biological pain such as hunger or cold. Or it is the need to fill a lack, like wanting a hug or wanting to feel safe. Later in life, the child uses what is called transitional objects like blankets, teddies, pillows, which they carry around as \"substitute friends\" so they don't have to feel separate. Another perspective equates desire with resistance and says that if I desire X it's because I'm resisting V. For example, if I desire to have money, it's because I am simultaneously resisting my subjective experience, (be it real or unreal of no money). In this way, desiring and resisting are two sides of the same coin. Unmet biological desires are painful (see Volume II on the False Core). When pain is resisted it is often substituted, replacing psychological wants (i.e., for food, sex, etc). Since many wants exist to relieve biological and/or emotional pain, problems arise when we try to substitute one pain reliever for another.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that desires often arise as a way to resist unfelt experiences can be a powerful tool in managing them. Rather than trying to eliminate desires, we can develop a non-judgmental attitude toward exploring them and allow ourselves to experience what is driving them. By doing so, we can avoid substituting one pain reliever for another and find a deeper sense of fulfillment."
