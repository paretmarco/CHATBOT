  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author recommends a method for personal growth, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and determination. In the last 200 tokens, the author presents a basic exercise that can be carried out in front of a mirror or through relaxation and visualization of desired outcomes. The exercise involves alternating the use of personal pronouns to create a sense of empowerment, and descriptive language to help visualize a desired state. This exercise can be done daily to reinforce positive thinking and self-motivation. The author encourages readers to apply the technique to achieve their objectives and improve their lives.",
  "content": "If you want to accentuate the effect, then whenever you are going to make use of the pronoun “you”, you should stare at your left eye, whereas you are going to fix the right one any time you will utilize the first person pronoun “I”. You ought to apply the sequences I can – I want – I decide both to what you would like to achieve and to the methodology you are going to adopt for the sake of achieving it. These three phrase-sequences, indeed, gather the three moments of your being, and enable the construction of the present. For example: You are a person in harmony with the natural elements, you feel nice, and today is a wonderful day! Yes, today is truly a marvellous day and I feel full of energies! Etc. This exercise already represents a way in which an image might enter our mind. It can also be carried out daily by one of you when he is alone, so as to lend a greater urge and stimulating incentive to his own life 79.",
  "last_phrase": "By applying the I can – I want – I decide sequence and using the left eye for \"you\" and the right eye for \"I\", you can improve your life and achieve your desired idea. With practice and persistence, you can easily rid yourself of old habits and patterns of behavior and develop new virtues and abilities. Start practicing this technique daily to boost your motivation and transform your life."
