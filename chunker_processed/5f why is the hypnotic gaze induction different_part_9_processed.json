  "title": "What is Fascination and How Does Animal Hypnotism Work?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the power of fascination and its ability to provide almost miraculous results for clients. The author speaks about the need to enter the \"animal mind\" of the subject and emphasizes the effectiveness of gaze induction in achieving quick and profound results. The author references the work of Prof. Erminio di Pisa and Milton Erickson to support their claims. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares a personal example of using fascination to induce a regression in a client, which resulted in quick and effective healing of negative emotions. The author also notes that fascination can lead to amnesia and can be combined with relaxation techniques for even stronger outcomes.",
  "content": "This kind of movement is very strange when perceived from the clients, as the fascinated subject is aware of being there but at the same time does not know in reality what he is doing. It is their unconscious, their animal mind, that excited begins to react and move the body. In a second she said: \"I'm in a corridor, I'm walking\". The scene became immediately clear and she also gave me all other details. Then we healed her negative emotions. From the beginning of the induction to this moment of the corridor 6 or 7 seconds were elapsed. You cannot realize an instant regression in so few seconds with verbal techniques, as these techniques rely on words and words need time to be said. Instead a big advantage of fascination is that this example is not the exception, it is the rule. Another interesting phenomenon is that many times we can get amnesia even after a very short span of time, more often than with any other method. Other uses are coupling fascination first and relaxation techniques afterwards. You will see that the relaxation will be the strongest one you had ever experienced.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination is a powerful tool in inducing hypnosis and regressing individuals to their unconscious mind in a matter of seconds. The use of counterlinguistics in animal hypnotism, such as the inclusion of negative words like \"not,\" can lead to surprising and effective results. Coupling fascination with relaxation techniques can also lead to stronger relaxation experiences. With such advantages, fascination could be a valuable technique to consider for those practicing hypnosis and related therapies."
