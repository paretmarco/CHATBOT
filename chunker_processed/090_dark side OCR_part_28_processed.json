  "title": "How does the Observer Effect in Quantum Physics relate to Self-Help and the Wounded Inner Child Identity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we dive into how the observer in quantum physics relates to self-help psychology. Heisenberg and John Wheeler showed that the observer participates and influences the outcome of experiments, which means that you, the observer of life, participate in constructing and experiencing your subjective world. The concept of the wounded inner child identity is explained as a creation of the observer through the act of \"looking.\" This created identity can limit perspectives and create behavioral patterns that affect present-time problems. The focus is on strategies to awaken the observer and dismantle past memories that restrict present-time experiences. This ties in with the prevalent use of the word \"quantum\" in the 1970s and 1980s.",
  "content": "The important thing to note at this stage of the book is that you (the observer) came before and are senior to the inner child identity. What I mean by this is that the observer existed before a trauma, the same observer was there during the trauma, and the same observer is there after the trauma ended. The inner child I-dentity is the cause of many of your present-time problems. Why? The wounded inner child you have participated in creating has a life-force of it's own, and limits your scope and perspective of the world and yourself. Furthermore, this observer-created identity creates behavioral inevitabilities like failure, break-up, or emotional distress. What we will focus on are the strategies, trances, or games, the dark side of the inner child plays, that effect your life. And, how to take the next step and The Beginning of the End of Inner Child 46 15 awaken the observer and dismantle this past memory that acts as a window we look through in present time. In the 1970s and 1980s, all of us saw the unparalleled everyday use of the word \"quantum.\" From television shows to chemical corporations, quantum became a household world.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, realizing that you, the observer, have the power to dismantle the constraints of the wounded inner child identity is the first step towards healing and taking control of your life. By becoming aware of the strategies and games the inner child plays, you can awaken and empower the observer, creating new perspectives and experiences that lead to emotional freedom and personal growth."
