  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding nonverbal communication is an essential aspect of effective communication with others. Proxemics, paralinguistics, gaze, magnetic passes, gestures, and touch all influence how we communicate with others. Through exercises and demonstrations, we can discover the power of proxemics and understand basic principles. It's important to tailor our approach to individual needs and personality types, and to be perceived positively to be effective. Additionally, the use of sounds, metacommunicational codes, and hypnodrama can further enhance the effectiveness of therapy. With an understanding of the various techniques and styles of communication, we can better connect with and help those we work with."
