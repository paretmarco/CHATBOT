  "title": "\"How can identifying and releasing inner child trances help overcome recurring problems in life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author explains how understanding the trances of the inner child can help identify problem states and de-hypnotize unwanted behaviors. The book proposes a model of \"recovered\" for a lifetime to de-hypnotize one's inner child, outlining 10 typical trances invoked by the inner child. Through John Lennon's song \"Jealous Guy,\" the author illustrates the concept of age regression and the importance of identifying one's own trances in order to move forward in life.",
  "content": "â€¢4 Age Regression: Acting Younger Than You Are I was dreaming of the past and my heart was beating fast, I began to lose control I began to lose control... I was feeling insecure You don't love me anymore I was shivering inside I was shivering inside I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry I didn't mean to hurt I'm just a jealous guy. \"Jealous Guy,\" John Lennon 26 * The Dark Side of the Inner Child In this song from the Imagine album, Lennon talks of two trances. First, he shifted from being an adult in present time to being a wounded child in past time. Secondly, he didn't lose control; rather, he became the inner child who was frozen, lost control and was shivering, scared, and jealous. Lennon could have called the song \"Jealous Wounded Child\" rather than \"Jealous Guy\", because, in order to feel the feelings, he had to become the inner child (dreaming of the past) and age regress (become younger than he was). Isn't this a familiar process for us all?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, age regression is a common process that occurs when we become overwhelmed by our emotions and our wounded inner child takes control. Understanding this automatic response pattern and working to heal the trauma that caused it can help us move past the dark side of our inner child and live more fully in the present."
