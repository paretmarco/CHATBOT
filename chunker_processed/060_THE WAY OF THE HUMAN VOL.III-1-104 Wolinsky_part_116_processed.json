  "title": "What is the Electromagnetic Mechanism and its relationship with the \"I\" and the body?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding section, Wolinsky and Louise talked about the nature of the self and consciousness. They concluded that the \"I\" is a by-product of and part of the Electromagnetic mechanism, and that there is no separate self. In this final part, they delve deeper into the concept of the Electromagnetic mechanism. Louise mentions that it still pulsates and moves in all directions, and that there is a central core around which it revolves. Wolinsky then asks whether Louise would still exist if this mechanism no longer existed, and what it would mean to be without it. Finally, they discuss the frozen emotions and motivations of the mechanism, including its desire for self-perpetuation and its view of humans as hosts.",
  "content": "Wolinsky:Since the \"I\" and the observer are a product of the Electro-magnetic mechanism, how does the body seem to you now? Louise:Solid—much more in it and grounded. Wolinsky:This Electra-magnetic mechanism, what's its movement now? Louise: Wolinsky: Louise: Wolinsky: I don't know, but I know I am not the mechanism. Are you? I don't know. Regarding the Electra-magnetic mechanism any frozen emotions the Electro-magnetic mechanism has? The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum Psychology Louise:Anger or rage because the Electro-magnetic mechanism does not want to be dismantled, it wants the force to remain. Wolinsky:If the Electro-magnetic mechanism were no longer there, would you be? Louise:The body would be—BUT- NO ME. Wolinsky:Does the Electro-magnetic mechanism have any frozen motivations? Louise:To continue itself. Wolinsky:Everything the Electro-magnetic mechanism does, it does for itself? Louise:Yes, it is self-perpetuating. Wolinsky:Anything the Electro-magnetic mechanism must not know? Louise:It must not know anything about being human. Wolinsky:To the Electro-magnetic mechanism, what is a human. Louise:A host.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of the Electro-magnetic mechanism challenges our perception of the self and raises questions about the true nature of our existence. It suggests that our bodies may simply be a host for this self-perpetuating mechanism, and if this mechanism were dismantled, we may no longer be the same. Exploring this idea further could lead us towards a deeper understanding of our true nature and purpose."
