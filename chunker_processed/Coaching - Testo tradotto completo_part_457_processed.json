  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, the author discussed how people are fond of gambling and willing to invest money in lotteries and jackpot machines. The young traders, lack of experience, tend to focus only on money and become its subservient slaves. The author emphasizes that acting well denotes having a goal to pursue, managing money properly, and being realistic. In the last 200 tokens, the author highlights the importance of defining your objective before engaging in trading and recommends focusing on the goal rather than solely on the money aspect. This approach helps to engage in good trading activities and avoid losing money due to emotional impulses.",
  "content": "Acting well denotes having a goal to pursue, managing money properly, and being realistic and present to the situation by endeavouring to do one's best. We can notice that, nowhere in the sentence we utilized to describe the import of â€œacting well\", does the word \"money\" appear. One of the rules governing the workings of the mind is: Every thing we draw attention to is seen as if through a magnifying glass. It seems to be larger. We step into a kind of trance wherein all we are able to perceive is the monetary aspect. If, however, our sole focus is money, the emotional impact will be extremely strong, we will lose sight of the line we are seeking to pursue, and we will be incapable of engaging in a good activity of trading. The recommendation to be given in this regard is to devote a bit of time to defining your objective before you begin to actively engage in trading, unless you have decided to throw away your money merely because you relish the emotion of playing or taking part in gambling.",
  "last_phrase": "To conclude, success in trading is not solely determined by money; rather, it requires having a clear objective, understanding the profession of trading, and developing a well-planned strategy with tactics. By following these guidelines, one can engage in effective trading that yields a net profit."
