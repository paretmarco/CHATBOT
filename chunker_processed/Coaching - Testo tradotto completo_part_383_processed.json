  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the existence of telepathy and how it can develop a potent look. Assuming it exists, this subtle force is guided by the mind and honed through exercises described in the book's first part. The last 200 tokens explain that a powerful look is more than just an attitude, it's a mental state. Self-confidence is crucial to unleashing one's will to power and, without it, one will never be able to influence others. This text seeks to offer additional instructions to cultivate a potent look, from using mental attitude to learning to smile sweetly with force of penetration.",
  "content": "Here is a list of some additional instructions in this regard: Use of the look Mental Attitude: A powerful look must, of course, consist in more than a mere attitude: It must be an inward state. You will never be able to have an appearance of resoluteness without being truly resolute. It is not possible for you to carry out things you yourselves do not believe you are capable of doing. When one is facing LACK of such SELF-CONFIDENCE, all you could possibly do is to have a desire to implement such things. The lack of confidence, the absence of faith in yourselves, will curb your will to power to such an extent that you will be disabled from resorting to it at all. This is one of the most important aspects on which you should keep on reflecting without any pause. If you inwardly feel yourselves unable to influence other people, you will in no way have the possibility of actually deploying your will to power.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, cultivating a powerful mental attitude involves more than just physical appearance and posture, but also an inner state of belief and confidence in oneself. The lack of self-confidence will act as a barrier against the free action by your will and hinder your ability to truly influence others. Therefore, it's crucial to reflect on this and nurture an unwavering faith in your own ability to achieve your goals, which will ultimately unleash your full potential and enable you to accomplish what you set out to do. Remember, your eyes reflect the strength of your will, so let your gaze reflect your unwavering determination to succeed."
