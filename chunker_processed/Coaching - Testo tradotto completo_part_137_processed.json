  "title": "How can paying less heed to our egos improve social relationships and nurture our originality?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of nurturing one's originality and breaking away from societal norms. The societal microcosm and macrocosm tends to absorb us, but we must fight against it to discover, cultivate, and increase our originality. The author stresses that passive individuals are useless and encourages rebellion as a means of achieving individuality. The future will prove us right, even if society despises us in the present. It is important to remember our smallness in the midst of life's pleasures and struggles.",
  "content": "Acting in the same way as the rest is a norm which is founded on fear (Tao Te King) Nurturing one’s own originality is every person’s first imperative. This originality, however, cannot be attained save by fighting against the societal microcosm and macrocosm which are inclined to absorb us. By that, we are preaching neither some kind of anarchy nor any incentive to rebellion. Our intention is rather to stress that passive man, the man in the grip of habits, is a useless being, a mere number whose disappearance matter nothing. No man exists who, in some respect, is not to an extent original. Discovering one’s own originality, cultivating it, increasing it, is the sole duty that each one of us has vis-à-vis the world. If accomplishing that necessitates one to rebel against the environment, daring is a must. Yes, the narrow society, one’s entourage, might despise us, but the future is going to prove us right. We should often remind ourselves of our smallness. We should bear that in mind in the midst of our pleasures and grieves, our business deals and games, as well as amid love and death.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, nurturing and cultivating our own originality is a crucial duty we owe to ourselves and the world. We must resist the fear-based norm of conformity and actively fight against societal absorption. While we should never forget our smallness, we should also avoid excessive earnestness and embrace a more open-minded vision of life. By doing so, we can contribute to the world and fulfill our ultimate responsibility as individuals."
