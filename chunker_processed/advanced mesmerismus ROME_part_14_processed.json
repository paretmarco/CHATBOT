  "first_phrase": "In the last section of this text, the focus is on non-verbal communication and the power of proxemics, paralinguistics, and gaze. The technique of non-verbal hypnosis is introduced, and the importance of testing a person's state is explained. Further, the exercises for equalizing the magnetic force, healing spine pain, and working with sciatica are described. The section ends with the hypno-drama method and how it helps to bring together the two halves of a person's problem. The imbalances reveal something that is not equally weighted in both sides, and sometimes symbols are identified with one side of an individual.",

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the Hypnodrama method can be an effective tool in therapy for opening the mind and evoking emotional reactions. Focusing the client on their problem is crucial for achieving results, and understanding the significance of true and false symbolism can help bring balance to the individual. Utilizing techniques such as the Swaying Test and Magnetic Maps can provide insight into the client's personality and aid in creating a personalized therapy plan. Self-hypnosis and exercises such as fluidification and moving therapy can also be helpful tools for clients to use outside of therapy sessions. With these techniques, a client can work towards achieving their desired outcome in therapy."
