  "title": "What is NLP and how does it differ from traditional psychoanalysis?",
  "first_phrase": "This chapter of the text focuses on various NLP techniques and their applications in different areas of life such as therapy, personal development, and business. It highlights the concept of anchoring and its role in connecting an image or sound with an emotional state or behavioral reaction. It also emphasizes the importance of focusing on the desired outcome rather than dwelling on the past for successful implementation of NLP techniques. The chapter gives examples of therapeutic metaphors and the use of time line as a powerful tool for personal change. Overall, the text emphasizes the empowering nature of NLP techniques and their ability to provide individuals with the tools to consciously work on themselves in a quick and dynamic way.",
  "content": "This is only one example to let you understand how NLP is different from that of traditional psychoanalyses, a fact that cannot be questioned. However, if you had to achieve an internal re-harmonizing objective or overcome a problem and you had to choose between two paths (one which was shorter and easier the other longer and sometimes with signs that often told you to turn back and start your sometimes torturous and painful journey again), which would you choose? Just think that during a psychotherapy session where NLP techniques are applied, you do not need to tell your life story or whatever it was that brought you to have the problem or block in the first place. It is important to understand what it is that we want to free ourselves from or the behavior we want to change and act on. It is not important to dig around in the past looking for the cause of the behavior we want to change. It is a waste of energy that can be instead put to work in a constructive way by ourselves. Obviously all these techniques are only successful when the person has the will to give up his old behavior and replace it with s more constructive one that s/he chooses. “Man was born to live, not to prepare himself to live”. (Boris Pasternàk) Once you have acquired the technique, you will be able to feel in total control of your life, even when you find yourself faced with resolving one of your problems.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, NLP provides a practical and efficient way to achieve internal re-harmonization and overcome problems, without the need to dwell on the past or undergo lengthy analyses. By focusing on what we want to change and using NLP techniques such as Emotional Release and compromise analysis, we can gain control over our behavior and become the craftsmen of our own progress. NLP's emphasis on freedom, choice, self-control, and autonomy offers a new paradigm for personal development and mental health, based on communication, feedback, and the power of our own minds."
