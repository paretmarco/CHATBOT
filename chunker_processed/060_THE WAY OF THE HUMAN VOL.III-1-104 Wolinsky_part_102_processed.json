  "title": "\"What's the Difference between Jung's Archetypes and Quantum Psychology's Archetypes?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the discussion revolved around the difference between Jung's beliefs in the psyche and its archetypical representation and Quantum Psychology's approach to going beyond the mind. This final part of the text focuses on the chapter III: Spiritual Systems and Archetypes. It explores how different spiritual systems are connected to physics dimensions and forces, and why relying solely on archetypes may hinder our spiritual growth. The purpose of this understanding is to appreciate the physics dimensions that help us view our archetypical structure and why we cannot go beyond believing and hoping to get something from it.",
  "content": "Please note that the list on the following page is very very brief and hardly complete but can serve as a simple contextual understanding. Also, it is in no way an attempt to \"put-down\" religions or therapies which seek realization. Still, if we understand their relationship to the Physics Dimensions and forces the Archetypes represent, then we can see why, if you are operating out of a \"spiritual\" or psychological system governed by the Physics Dimension and forces, you will always be acting out of an Archetypeâ€”spinning your wheels and never \"getting\" anywhere.\" To repeat a Quantum Psychology principle, you can never go beyond an Archetype through an Archetype. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: If you are operating out of an Archetypical system based and organized by a Physics Dimension you can only \"act out\" the Archetype. THE PURPOSE OF THE UNDERSTANDING I.To appreciate the Physics Dimensions which helps us to view our Archetypical structure (systems) rather than believing in it and hoping to \"get\" something from it. 2. To appreciate why we cannot get to much further than believ- ing and hoping to \"get.\" 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the relationship between spiritual or psychological systems and the Physics Dimensions and forces represented by Archetypes is crucial to avoid getting stuck in an Archetypical system. It helps us appreciate the limitations of these systems and view our Archetypical structure from a more objective viewpoint. Thus, we can transcend the Archetype and move towards true self-realization. Please note that this list is just a brief example and not an attempt to belittle any religion or therapy."
