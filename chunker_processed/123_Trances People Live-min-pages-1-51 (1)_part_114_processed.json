  "title": "How do intra- and interpersonal dynamics affect our behavior and create trances in our minds?",
  "first_phrase": "In this concluding section, the author ties together the interplay between intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics in creating trances, which can lead to both healthy and pathological states. The author explores how violation triggers anger, which can be age-regressed and replayed in present time. The discussion also highlights the importance of understanding the individual's internal world and intrapersonal context, rather than solely focusing on external factors.",
  "content": "when age 40 the adult is violated, the anger experienced is Way °len al Pto the current trigger. Why? Because the event at a:1411°( catalyzes all earlier violations. This is age regressed anger wheTCbti the adult \"retrieves\" the age-regressed child and re-ex ces itin present time—instantaneously, out of time. Understanding that both intra- and interpersonal dynamics ca exist in any individual bridges a longstanding dispute in the field of psychotherapy in which one school seeks to prove that all interaction, are context-dependent (the family therapists), while another pls. sionately asserts that the individual is the only source of lashchange (depth psychotherapists). Another way of integrating the intrapersonal with the interpersonal is to understand that individuals create trances in response to interpersonal contexts, which they then internalize as a self-to-self trance. In other words, they are having an interpersonal interaction in an intrapersonal context. I have found that pathology as well as health is a product of the combination of both intrapsychic processes and interpersonal dy namics. Family therapists tend to lose sight of the fact that each person has an internal world which he or she recreates in present time.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the complex interplay between intra- and interpersonal dynamics is crucial in psychotherapy. Pathology and health are not solely products of one or the other but rather a combination of both. By realizing the similarities between the \"inner\" and \"outer\" worlds, therapists can help individuals work through age-regressed anger and other traumas to change their present-time interactions and improve their mental health."
