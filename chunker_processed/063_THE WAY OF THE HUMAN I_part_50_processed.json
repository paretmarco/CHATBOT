  "title": "How can Quantum Psychology help you transcend your psychology and stabilize awareness in ESSENCE and I AM?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text on Quantum Psychology, the author explores the concept of being willing to acknowledge and experience one's psychology before being able to go beyond it. The text highlights the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ram Dass on the importance of knowing and owning one's concepts, in order to move past them. The author also delves into why Multi-Dimensional Awareness, specifically ESSENCE and I AM, is unknown to us and how fixating on certain dimensions can prevent us from experiencing others. Ultimately, the text suggests that chronic ensnarement can be lifted, and awareness can become liberated.",
  "content": "But if you do not acknowledge how your awareness is chronically fixated, then no matter what beautiful experiences you have of ESSENCE or the VOID (samadhi) during meditation, when you come out and open your eyes, talk to your relationship, your boss, etc., you are going to get smacked in the face with your own concepts. In other words, your issues will all come up again. ESSENCE AM COLLECTIVE-ARCHETYPICAL NOT-I-I VOID NAMELESS ABSOLUTE BEYOND THE QUESTION The most commonly asked question is, \"Why is Multi-Dimensional Awareness—and specifically, the awareness of ESSENCE, I AM, etc.—unknown to us?\" \"Why aren't they available?\" The answer seems to be that if all of your awareness is fixated on thoughts and emotions around the False Core-False Self concept—for example, \"I am inadequate,\" etc.—then there is no awareness left to be aware of ESSENCE, I AM, etc. In other words our awareness is gobbled up by that fixation in this one arena (dimension) and cannot become stabilized in any of the other dimensions. Simply stated, awareness that is fixated on a particular dimension cannot be liberated. But this tendency disappears and awareness which is chronically ensnared becomes liberated.",
  "last_phrase": "To develop multi-dimensional awareness, we must acknowledge and experience our fixations and false self-concepts. Only when our awareness is freed up from these fixations can we naturally access ESSENCE, I AM, and other dimensions. Tranc-end your trances and embrace the liberation of your awareness to transcend limitations and experience true spiritual growth."
