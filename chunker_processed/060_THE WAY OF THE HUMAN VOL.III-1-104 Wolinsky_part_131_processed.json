  "title": "\"What is Nisargadatta Maharaj's teaching on I AM? How does it relate to False Core-Self and Consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text delves into the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj, who emphasized the importance of holding onto the \"I AM\" and letting go of everything else to overcome the False Core-False Self. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses how the concept of I AM and I AM NOT has deceived people into believing in a separate self. They explore the idea that consciousness is also a concept and question the relationship between the concepts of I AM and \"you.\"",
  "content": "If the concept of I AM and the concept of I AM NOT have no location or address, notice what your eperience is. .. (Silence.) This I AM-I AM NOT concept. Is there anything those two concepts must not experience? if \"I\" ask the concepts they don't like the idea I know they are concepts. What must these concepts called I AM-AM NOT, what must they not know? They are just concepts. Notice how the concept called I AM-I AM NOT, notice how it could also create the concepts of space, \"my space,\" me,\" etc. Prior to all that, was there a thing called consciousness or non-consciousness? If I AM NOT is separate from non-existence, what occurs? ________________ No, consciousness seems like a concept too. After the concept of I AM-I AM NOT, space, my space occurred—was there a thing called consciousness? Edward:Yes. The Way of the Human • Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter III Wolinsky:Does this concept called I AM-I AM NOT or evenWolinsky:Anything? the blankness or \"my space\" have anything to do with \"you\"?Edward:...Silence. Edward:No.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of I AM and I AM NOT may seem real, but they are just concepts not grounded in any specific location or address. The ideas of space and consciousness emerged from their interaction, but ultimately, they do not belong to anyone in particular. Thinly spreading out the Archetypical concept of I AM-I AM NOT yields no real change."
