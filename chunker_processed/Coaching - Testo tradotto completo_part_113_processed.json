  "first_phrase": "In the earlier part of the text, the author presents the idea that becoming accustomed to relaxation enhances our ability to appreciate life with greater intensity. The text further explains how accumulation of personal magnetism requires stopping our thoughts from issuing forth, which results in faster repairing of our strengths. In the last 200 tokens, the author analyses how to accomplish a mental void, which is a significant part of achieving personal magnetism. The text puts forth that thinking of nothing is an extremely demanding task and discusses the unconsciously persistent background thoughts that accompany our conscious thoughts.",
  "content": "This state of incessant motion might in some cases be compared to a pathological condition. The person who operates in that fashion is never in possession of sufficient strength to enable him to project a vigorous light onto some important thought. We must, by contrast, think not in an automatic but in a voluntary manner, with our maximum possible intensity. However, in order to subsequently recover by rest from the unavoidable loss of energy resultant on such an effort, we must be then be acquainted with how we can avoid thinking about anything. How to accomplish a mental void How does one, however, manage to think of nothing? It is an extremely demanding task indeed. Beyond our conscious thoughts, in fact, we also have an unceasing, unconscious thought, a worry of a certain kind which always accompanies our activity as if it were some kind of muted orchestra. Today this background drone might consist, for instance, in thinking about a certain material or moral undertaking, whereas tomorrow it might take the form of an apprehensiveness regarding your health, and the following day the idea of going on a possible trip.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to set ourselves free from the endless unconscious thought that colors our mental side, we must learn how to accomplish a mental void, even a thought-non-thought state. By doing so, we can achieve the neutral and indifferent state of ataraxia, which can be beneficial for our mental health and overall well-being."
