  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens of the text delve into the different types of hypnotic gaze induction, a technique which has been extensively studied and experimented on owing to the incredible power of the human gaze. The text cites various studies and experts to highlight the importance of eye contact in social interactions, first impressions, and even certain therapies. The author also notes that while hypnotic gaze inductions can be notably effective, there are two distinct types of this technique, which involve the intermixing of words in one variation.",
  "content": "Why is the hypnotic gaze induction different Gaze has an incredible power. Even our auditory perception of space is influenced by gaze and experimental studies have also shown that in social interactions a steady gaze is a sure asset and that the eyes can change the answer of our partner (Keating, Mazur, Segall 1977). The eyes are even more important in the first contact with somebody, as many experts have observed that the first 30 seconds and the first 4 minutes of an encounter have crucial significance (Zunin 1976). In these cases many times we get answers from other people that in reality we create unconsciously. It has also been experimentally proved that the effectiveness of certain therapies can be directly related to the gaze interaction (Harrigan, Oxman e Rothental 1985). Other experimental studies have shown that our logical mind is reduced and emotions are felt more intensely when somebody looks at us intensively. In hypnotism, the effects of the hypnotic gaze inductions are noteworthy. However, we should also consider that there are two types of inductions referred to as \"hypnotic gaze induction\". In the first one, the use of the eyes is intermixed with words.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the hypnotic gaze induction can be a powerful tool for influencing others, whether intentionally or not. Understanding the different types of inductions and their effects can give you an advantage in social interactions and even certain types of therapy. However, it is important to use this power ethically and avoid manipulating others."
