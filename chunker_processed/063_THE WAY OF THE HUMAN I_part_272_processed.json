  "title": "\"What is the Biological False Core and how is it related to the Fight/Flight Response?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the focus is on the importance of separating the dimensions of experiences in order to dismantle the collapsing of the biological with the thinking and/or emotional dimensions. The author explains how the body has both a fight/flight response and a dissociative trance response to handle shock using emotional, thought or spiritual buffering trance processes to organize chaos. It is important to recognize false conclusions and compensations, such as \"I have no control\" or \"I must control myself, others or the environment,\" that the nervous system creates to handle chaos. By separating the dimensions, the nervous system can learn and respond more accurately to present-time external experiences.",
  "content": "Because the experiences which are run through the nervous system lose their survival accuracy, and the body neurons use the same pathways to recreate the same patterns of emotional response regardless of the present time external. It sees the past as the present and the future. It is as if the nervous system were playing the same record by 166 This simple process can help dismantle the collapsing of the biological with the thinking and/or emotional dimensions. Incidentally, boredom is a reaction to the unmet biological need of learning. Learning must continue to deeper and deeper levels of complexity. BIOLOGICAL FALSE CORE #1 FALSE CORE CONCLUSION: \"I have no control,\" \"There is no control in the world\" \"I am out of control,\" FALSE SELF COMPENSATION: \"I must control myself, others or the environment.\" 167 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness As with all False Cores, this biological-False Conclusion is an attempt to handle the chaos the nervous system experiences by using the newer brain. This conclusion by the newer brain is not true, it is further away from the experience itself as are all conclusions or interpretations about experiences.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to overcome the limitations of our nervous system and dismantle false biological conclusions, we must continue learning and developing multi-dimensional awareness. Remember, false conclusions can only yield false solutions, so it's crucial to approach experiences with an open and flexible mindset to find true solutions."
