  "first_phrase": "This text presents some practical exercises in mesmerism by Dr. Paret. Prior to the given text, Dr. Paret gives a brief introduction to mesmerism, its history and some of the theories behind it. The last part of the text suggests several exercises to make your eyes stronger, improve your sensibility, and practice thought transmission with friends. The text suggests working on yourself first since the observer influences the observed. Information on Mesmerismus.info and Dr. Paret's website is provided for further study.",
  "content": "5 - Fascination relies on sensibility. Find a friend and try to exercise what is called \"thought transmission\". Begin with modern exercises (there is plenty of books on the subject) but after go back to the ancient. 6 - Exercise with all your clients, and even in everyday situation, for discovering the effects of the various type of gaze. 7 - While you gaze and exercise on others, remember always that for fascination the quantum axiom is fundamental: \"the observer influences the observed\". So firstly work on yourself and your expectations before working with others! Practice and do not hesitate to write me at paret@neurolinguistic.com for further ideas and hints.

  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, developing fascination skills requires sensibility, practice, and patience. Try thought transmission exercises with a friend, discover the effects of various gazes, and always remember the quantum axiom. Work on yourself before working with others and don't hesitate to seek further help from experts in the field."
