  "title": "\"How can self-persuasion and daydreaming turn obstacles into accessories for achieving success?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author emphasizes the importance of having a clear vision and belief in achieving one's goals and the power of self-suggestion. In the last 200 tokens, the author exemplifies the practical application of these concepts when facing a challenging situation. The author suggests that visualizing the situation beforehand and using self-persuasion can greatly increase the chances of success. The person must keep inside themselves the vision of a modified self through daydreaming, and through stages of unperceivable moments, the desired result will be accomplished. The author shows that self-persuasion can be utilized in various situations, including facing one's fears and beliefs.",
  "content": "Just as, — in order to make things clearer to ourselves —, it is possible to make the forearm contract irresistibly upon one's arm simply through a process of self-suggestion to the effect that “that must necessarily be accomplished”, it will also be possible, and with even greater force, to behave to our advantage in a given situation. It is nevertheless necessary to observe that, exactly in the same way that even a slightest initial motion of a “voluntary” character does facilitate the self-persuasive, automatic contraction of the forearm upon one's arm, even a most negligible “voluntary” initiative will be of extraordinary benefit to the accomplishment of the desired result. I – let us assume — predict for this afternoon the need to betake to a certain person who instils fear in me: It is necessary for me to go and meet him at his place, inasmuch as he is the only one who can benefit my attempt to realize my purpose. It is something clear and unchallengeable that the prior visualization of the conversation with such a person, which is achieved through fantasy, concentration, and spiritual prayer, will confer near-mathematical certainty on the success of my undertaking.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve success, it is essential to take a small, voluntary initiative towards your goals just as visualizing the desired outcome is crucial. However, it is also important to be prepared for unexpected situations, which can be done by creating alternative imaginings. Having a logical life plan that aligns with individual objectives can help live each day to the fullest. Remember to take action towards your goals to make your dreams a reality."
