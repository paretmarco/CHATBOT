  "title": "How can Quantum Psychology help you understand and unleash your animal nature?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of Quantum Psychology, which suggests that one cannot overcome their animal nature, and it's not necessary to do so. It proposes viewing life through the animal dimension in order to gain a different understanding of relationships and situations. The author gives an example of a business arrangement, which makes sense externally, but when viewed through the animal dimension, it becomes clearer why they want to own the author, and how it is related to territorial behavior. In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and unleashing one's animal energy, as repression can lead to mental health issues.",
  "content": "If I look at this through the thinking dimension, I might think, \"They've got stuff about ownership.\" But at the animal level, it is the same as a dog peeing around a person. In other words, it becomes much clearer and easier to understand what's going on. Obviously in this particular business situation, they want me to sign an exclusive contract so 156 Chapter VIII that I won't work with anyone else. At the external business dimension that makes total sense; but at a deeper level governed by biology, they're acting like territorial animals and their \"business explanation\" is a justification coming after the fact to justify something governed by the nervous system. In other words, the animal rules and the explanation take place after the fact, as a kind of story line, a psychology/philosphy to explain and justify everything. Viewing from this animal level helps to make things more understandable. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: You have to unleash your animal energy. Acknowledge it, allow it to be there. It's very powerful, otherwise, the repression of it makes you crazy. IT IS NOT HUMAN TO REPRESS The nervous system is biological, there are survival instincts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and acknowledging our animal instincts is crucial for our mental and emotional well-being. While we may justify our actions with logical explanations, it's important to recognize the underlying biological motivations at play. By embracing our animal energy and allowing it to be present, we can lead a more fulfilling life. So don't repress it - unleash it!"
