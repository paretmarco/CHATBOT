  "title": "How does the inner child's attraction affect our relationships as adults?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the power of attraction of the inner child and its impact on adult relationships. The author recounts a personal experience where they observed their inner child's pattern interrupt and prevented a possible dragging relationship. The author explains how inner child to inner child connections can create a compelling attraction, resulting in spiritual philosophies such as soul mates or meant to be. The author also highlights how trances, including hyper-vigilance and disconnection, overlap and work together to shape an individual's behavior. The discussion is exemplified by a woman's story of taking care of an alcoholic father to survive, ultimately resulting in over-identification and hyper-vigilance trance.",
  "content": "Actually, the overwhelming, compulsive attraction is the inner child's attraction to another' s inner child. Very often, inner-child to inner-child connections are so strong that the child within the adult adapts a spiritual philosophy like, \"This was meant to be,\" or \"We are soul mates.\" Although this falls under the trance of spiritualization, dis-connection and other trances overlap and work in tandem. As with all trances, fusion is created by a series of family interactions. For example, an individual may be an \"adult child of an alcoholic\" and had to take care of parents or siblings. They experienced not being able to let go, daydream, fantasize, or even play. Fear of possible catastrophic outcomes in the environment cause the child to be overly responsible (for the non-functioning parent). Thus, a hyper-vigilance trance. I had a woman whose father was alcoholic and she always took care of him. Her philosophy was, \"I'll take care of him, so that he can take care of me.\" She had to over-identify and watch every move Dad made so that she could survive.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding our own trances and how they relate to our childhood experiences can help us break free of patterns that keep us stuck. By acknowledging and healing our inner child, we can create space for more fulfilling relationships and a more peaceful internal state. So take the time to listen to your inner child, understand its needs, and work towards integrating it into your adult self."
