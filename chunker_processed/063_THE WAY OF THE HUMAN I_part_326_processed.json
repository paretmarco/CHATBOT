  "title": "What is the Trance of Survival and How Does it Affect Development and Identity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the focus is on the powerful trance of survival and how it affects our development as individuals. The text discusses the creation of an individual self and dissociative observer, which are formed during childhood to defend against the loss of self in relationship to the world. It also delves into how this trance can lead individuals to feel both separate and special, often leading to grandiosity or feeling more spiritual. The author gives an example of a woman in New York who wanted to become a guru after her heart was broken in a relationship.",
  "content": "In this developmental sequence, the survival trance begins when children realize that they are separate and independent from their mother or father. This creation of an individual self is a crucial period. It is also a time for the development of a dissociative observer which is formed to defend against the loss of self in relationship to the world or to defend against the body's biological needs not being met. Identities begin to emerge to interact with the world and other people, hiding our deep feelings of total separateness. This dissociative observer might be a major reason for feeling apart from humanity. Since the trance of survival is so powerful, the dissociative observer feels both separate and special, often feeling more spiritual or more grandiose (since they are not connected to their bodies, hence losing the world [the trance of spiritualization will be discussed in greater detail later]). For example, I spoke to a woman in New York who wanted to be a guru and whose heart was broken in a relationship several years ago.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the creation of an individual self is a crucial stage in human development. However, it also leads to the development of a dissociative observer that can disconnect us from our bodies, the world, and others. Understanding and acknowledging this dissociative trance can help us avoid feeling apart from humanity and being trapped in spiritual or grandiose delusions. It is important to recognize that our bodies and biological needs are a fundamental part of our being and can't be ignored."
