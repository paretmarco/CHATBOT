  "title": "Why is it important to define objectives with a time context and how does excessive pursuit lead to misfortunes?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the author delves deeper into the idea of defining objectives with a time context. They highlight the importance of having a goal in the trading industry and how the human mind naturally tends to wander without one. The author draws comparisons with physics, explaining that human energy's propelling force causes excessive pursuit of goals, leading to misfortunes. The text ultimately questions the generative element of our self-destructive urges, as explored in the first chapter of the book.",
  "content": "It is however imperative to adequately bear in mind that, in this context, gratification does not come to an end at the very moment in which equilibrium is reached. Human energy has such a propelling force that the bullet transcends the target almost in every instance. Thus, whenever a person devoid of a goal succeeds in making a gain, he will desire to earn more. This excessive pursuit is the cause of all our misfortunes. We are not unhappy because of the fact we fulfil our desires, but due the point that, as we fulfil them, we cross over the point of static equilibrium. Man wants to feel enjoyment, as if he was the legendary inveterate drunkard who at first used to drink in order for him to quench his thirst, and then ended up doing so merely out of the pleasure he came to draw from the act of drinking. What is the generative element of this self-destructive urge, undifferentiated from the way we have already come across in the course of the first chapter of this book?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to acknowledge that gratification is not a finite concept and the pursuit of excessive desire is the root of all our misfortunes. Fantasy often creates needs that are disproportionate to our reality, leading us to constantly trespass our limits. Recognizing this self-destructive urge is the first step towards finding true happiness and contentment in life."
