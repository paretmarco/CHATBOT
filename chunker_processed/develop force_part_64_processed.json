At this point, the practitioner asks to gain strength with a particular language, where through a series of transformations based on Numerology, converting words into numbers so, for example, “five give me eight” is the numerological transformation of “Virgilio give me magnetism”. You can use the same Numerology to create your own \"keyword\" to unleash the force. Bishoff Method In addition to focusing on the eyes of a picture pronouncing ciphers, another technique handed down by Bishoff and others consists in the observation of a drawn eye. First, you must pay attention fixedly to the central point. Then have to expand your gaze to the global outline of the eye, returning finally to the central point. And, mentioned by various schools of personal magnetism, see for example Apollonius \"Manuel express de magnétisme personnel\". The manual contains many handy exercises designed to increase the magnetic force through specific symbols. The tradition of using numbers for fascination seems to have ancient origin. In an article entitled \"Walks in Calabria\", Caterina Pignorini-Boers, tells of seeing into a home a horseshoe, two horns, and two numbers (fatal numbers) 8 and 9 to keep away the jinx. Then she asked \"why?” The elderly woman said \"against the jinks\" (\"Pel fora fascino, signorina\"). And what is it a jinks?",
