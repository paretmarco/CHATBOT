  "title": "\"How can we effectively plan and balance our short, medium, and long-term goals while staying present in the now?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, we explored the importance of using multiple time frames in order to avoid cognitive traps and achieve our goals. This last part focuses on the concept of time itself, and how balance between Chronos (structured, objective-driven time) and Kairòs (spontaneous, present-focused time) is key to success. The author introduces these concepts and encourages us to retain an attitude of presence and enjoyment while creating short and medium-term plans directed at our goals.",
  "content": "It is imperative, however, that we should not only live within temporal imagination. Whoever, in fact, does not also develop the time of the instant (Kairòs), only enslaves himself to his logical and habit-loving brain, and accordingly loses opportunities and the taste for life. He is incapable of manifesting vital energy, free from any time constriction, in the now. Whereas Chronos steers the vital energy, in fact, Kairòs frees it in a spontaneous manner, as it consists in the consciousness of the instant which sets energy free. Not being immersed in kairòs, therefore, means that one lacks the capacity to open himself up to higher horizons, including the spiritual and creative horizons. It is only in establishing a balance between these two times that success is found. 1) Chronos: Vital force directed at an objective – structure of the day 2) Kairòs: Vital force which is present in the now ? - distilled quintessence of the day Let us retain an attitude of life which is steeped in presence and the enjoyment of the now and of acting Short-Term Plan (day or week) ? Medium-term plan (year or time period directed at a goal) ?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is imperative to establish a balance between Chronos and Kairòs, the two times that govern our lives. While Chronos steers our vital energy towards an objective, Kairòs sets our energy free in the consciousness of the instant, allowing us to be present and enjoy the now. By embracing both, we open ourselves up to higher horizons and manifest vital energy, free from any time constriction, both in our short-term and medium-term plans as well as in our ideal-based or life plans."
