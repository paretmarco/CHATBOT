  "title": "\"Why Are Spiritualized People So Rigidified? Exploring Archetypes and False Spirituality from a Quantum Psychology Perspective\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author explains how spiritualization leads to the creation of false archetypes and a rigid way of life. In this last section, the author delves deeper into the concept of Archetypes and how dissociative defenses become spiritualized to form False Archetypes. The author emphasizes that the departure point for an Archetype is the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and not the COLLECTIVE or personal \"I.\" The author warns against confusing False Spirituality, laden with dogma, rules, and rituals, with true spirituality based on direct condensations of the VOID.",
  "content": "For example, let's imagine your mother is crazy and you resist it. So in your relationship with her there's a lot of repressed anger. You then create an internalized \"good, all knowing\" mother as a defense against the \"crazy\" mother. But this good mother is not an Archetype since an Archetype is a direct flow formed from the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. If I am going from VOID to form to greater form, creating a dissociative form or repression of form—this is not an Archetype. It can be said that the handling of unwanted stimuli (crazy mother) through dissociation and spiritualization is universal. Still, its last departure point is not from the COLLECTIVE but from the personal \"I.\" To determine whether it is an Archetype or repressed spiritualization—ask \"yourself,\" Where was its departure point? Archetypes arise as direct condensations of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Spiritual-dissociation arises from greater condensation, dissociation and repression of the personal unconscious, yielding greater rigidity of character, more rules, more defenses and in a word, False spirituality, laden with dogma, rules and ritual.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the concept of Archetypes and spiritualization through dissociation are two distinct phenomena. While Archetypes arise as direct condensations of undifferentiated consciousness, the latter arises from repression of the personal unconscious. The myth of separation, commonly found in religion, is a spiritualized defense mechanism against the shock of realization of separation from the mother. By understanding the difference between these concepts, we can develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and our spirituality."
