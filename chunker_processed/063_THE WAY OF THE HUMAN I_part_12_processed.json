  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and How Does it Reflect the Quantum World as an Ongoing Event and Process?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author highlights the importance of realizing one's humanness, rather than focusing on being or becoming something. The text also delves into the concept of Quantum Psychology and how it mirrors the ongoing process of the Quantum world. The author explains that personal pronouns are moving Quantum events that arise and subside, representing only a facsimile of the nervous system. The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS appears to be differentiated when, in reality, it has not. The author notes that finding out who you are is not about being or becoming something, but rather realizing your humanness.",
  "content": "This is an attempt to denote them as moving Quantum events which arise and subside. They (I, me, she, him, her) are an appearance as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS condenses and thins-out, and represent only a facsimile of the nervous system. This suggests that each arising I is made of the same substance as the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS; but from the space-time limitations of the nervous system the I appears to be made of a different substance than the \"no-I\" VOID background. I should also note that the VOID is UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS (i.e., consciousness without distinctions). The \"you\" you call yourself (i.e., like a thought, chair, air, the observer, etc.) is differentiated consciousness. The VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS appears to be differentiated when actually it has not. F, inding out who you are is not about being or becoming something, it is about first realizing your humanness. . . .",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, realizing your humanness is the key to finding out who you truly are. Quantum Psychology and the concepts of \"me,\" \"you,\" and \"I\" only represent a temporary and illusory appearance arising from the undifferentiated consciousness, which is the true essence of existence. Remember, you are not just a specific something, but rather an event in the continuum of the ONE SUBSTANCE of the universe."
