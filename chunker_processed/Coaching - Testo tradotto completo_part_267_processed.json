  "content": "Planning so as to live in the now Whoever summons what is useful to each and every hour of his life, and who regulates his day as if it was his whole life, neither desires tomorrow nor fears it (Seneca) Fence your today with a high wall devoid of any exit point, and fight against the enemies of your today 62. Inverting the famous aphorism, we would suggest «not to do today what you should do tomorrow». Even in this sense, you must tell yourselves that tomorrow does not exist, that tomorrow is an invention. In order to live harmoniously, you should avoid, in the morning, to hastily plunge into the heart of that particular day, as it would then commence without any preparatory phase. You must first of all perceive your own selves, feel your own existence, in so doing letting go of every blocked emotion. Secondly, you should start by asking yourselves which is the most urgent daily task that is looming ahead of you, and by accurately examining the details of that specific task pursuant to the said prioritizing. What we have set out here above represents the nucleus around which all your actions for that day should ultimately gather.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by planning and organizing your daily tasks with a focus on the present moment, you can efficiently tackle challenges and achieve success. As Seneca said, those who regulate their day as if it were their whole life and live in the now neither desire nor fear tomorrow. So, begin each morning with a plan of action and visualize success to efficiently accomplish your daily tasks. Remember, tomorrow is an invention, and today is all we have."
