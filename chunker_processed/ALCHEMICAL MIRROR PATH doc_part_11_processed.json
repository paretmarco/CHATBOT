  "title": "How to Use Mirrors to Access Higher States of Consciousness and Experience Lucid Dreaming in Waking State?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the use of mirrors as a tool to explore different levels of consciousness. It begins by discussing the physical stage and progresses through the fluidic and etheric stages, leading up to the fourth and final stage: the liberation of one's sulfur. The last 200 tokens focus on the fourth stage, where the consciousness reaches a superior level and can even voluntarily increase the sensation of vertigo to a level near the loss of consciousness. The text also explains the importance of staying present and developing a sense of firm and tenacious immobility to overcome the trials and dangers of this practice.",
  "content": "Note, the same results can be reached by other means, including where, for example, the rotation of the head at an angle, the breathing performed with particular rhythm, they can also be used certain reactions of sexual union, feelings of love, etc.. the latter methods are not advisable to apply for the rapid dangerous violence, not allowing a gradual development of control (in alchemy they are called \"corrosive waters\") In all these ways, however, you must be able to direct the force that is impression for your purpose. Strange phenomena are occurring at perception in the course of these experiments. (Note : in some experiments it is better to sit down while looking at the mirror, in case you loose totally consciousness) Vertigo - which often results in panic in a weak-willed person, and this panic can be an obstacle for further refinement, easily can instead in an evolved person be changed in a strange and almost funny curiosity when the consciousness, detached from the body, almost suspended in mid-air of the room, has the perception safe and controllable of the new situation in which he is, knows that sees, even feeling it has no eyes, and see a space surrounding that, wonder of wonders, can increase or diminish by will. There is no more a fixed idea of space. The operator can also contemplate the body, lying inert, and say: - I am the one here, but I'm not, I am an I am not at the same time, or I'm not at all?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, through a series of exercises involving observation, element work, and self-hypnosis, one can access deeper states of consciousness and even overcome pain. By identifying with the abyss and the cosmic consciousness, one can break free from their ordinary self and experience new levels of awareness. These exercises may seem absurd and impossible to conceive at first, but with practice and dedication, one can climb the highest steps of initiation to the supreme mysteries."
