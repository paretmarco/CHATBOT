  "title": "How can understanding our animal nature through Quantum Psychology help us navigate societal rules and biological instincts?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section of this text, the author discusses how the animal nature of humans influences their behavior in business situations, despite external justifications for their actions. The author introduces the concept of the nervous system's biological instincts and the repression of animal urges, which can lead to an internal struggle. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains the importance of acknowledging and embracing one's animal energy, as it is hard-wired into their biological makeup. The author suggests that attempting to suppress these urges leads to distortions in spiritual and psychological growth. Society's rules placed on biology create a \"crazy\" psychology.",
  "content": "No matter how enlightened you are, there are certain things that are hard-wired into the nervous system. Look at all of the body functions such as eating, sleeping, shitting and fucking. They are all biological. How would you feel if you didn't get enough sleep? Probably irritable and cranky. No matter how much psychotherapy you have done, sleep's a basic biological function. Sexuality is the survival of the species. Spiritual systems often suggest that you can become enlightened (spiritualized, purified) through biological deprivation such as giving up food or sex. This makes as much sense as saying, you have a better chance of \"attaining\" enlightenment if you don't go the bathroom anymore. This spiritualization by repression of biological urges fueled by the spiritualization process of making Dad and Mom into Gods and Goddesses creates a massive distortion, whereby the spiritualized Dad/Mom are Gods, Goddesses, a path, etc., which is really a spiritualized super-ego. Society attempts to repress our animal nature; and thus we have society's rules vis-a-vis the church placed on our biology. Naturally the biological-energy goes crazy and produces a \"crazy\" psy- 157 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness chology.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to remember that while spiritual growth is valuable, it shouldn't come at the expense of our biological needs. Embracing our animal nature and being present with our energy can lead to a healthier, more well-rounded approach to personal growth. Defying our natural instincts only leads to repression, and embracing them can actually help us move closer to true enlightenment."
