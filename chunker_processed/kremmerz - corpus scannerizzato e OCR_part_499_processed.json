  "first_phrase": "This text describes the ritual of the Eucharist and a prayer that is recited during important hours of the night. The Eucharist is symbolized by a chalice that holds water and wine, which are the red and white currents of nature that reproduce themselves in every small part of the universe. The prayer is known as Osiris' prayer, and it contains several verses that are recited while facing east, in white clothes, and with a clean body. The prayer mentions several names such as Ocreza Salemi, Otare Maschin Bin Flute, Kons Satrope, and Osiris, who are seen as powerful figures in this ritual.",
