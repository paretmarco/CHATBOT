  "first_phrase": "In the previous sections, we learned about the importance of choosing the right activities, being conscious of time, and preparing for work. In section VI, the author provides practical advice on how to manage our time effectively by subdividing it into smaller units capable of being completed successfully. The text emphasizes the need to prioritize tasks and communicate our priorities to others. This approach can help us maintain focus and accomplish our goals.",
  "content": "If you are unable to choose the work to be done, make at least sure to choose the part of it which you like to see accomplished within the time at your actual disposal. IV. Prepare the ground. Do not ever undertake any manual or intellectual work without having first surrounded yourselves with all the tools you might need in the course of executing it. V. As much as you can, subdivide the available time and the work that needs to be done into smaller units of time or work which are capable of being successfully completed. Thereafter, you should consider the first such unit of time as having been already occupied by the first work, as being no longer available for any other undertaking, that is. In doing so you will have to refuse, «as much as possible» (i.e. through a struggle with other people or with your own selves), to utilize the time differently; you must learn how to say, both to your own selves and to others, 'I must do this', 'I cannot do anything apart from this.' VI.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, effective time management is crucial for achieving success in work and life. To make the most of your time, choose tasks you enjoy, prepare your tools, and subdivide your time and work into smaller units. Strive for precision in your work and aim to produce tangible results. Remember to prioritize completing immediate tasks promptly, and you will be on the path to accomplishing your goals efficiently."
