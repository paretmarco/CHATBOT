  "title": "\"What is the Essential Dimension Exercise for stabilizing awareness of ESSENCE and acknowledging lies?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text, the focus is on stabilizing one's awareness of ESSENCE, which refers to the essential qualities of an individual. It is suggested that false core beliefs hinder this process and one must identify these beliefs and replace them with essential experiences to progress. The exercise involves experiencing the spaciousness in one's own and another's body, realizing that they are made up of the same substance. This exercise is recommended for developing a deeper sense of essence in oneself and others. The text references \"The Tao of Chaos: Quantum consciousness, Volume IL 9 the Human Beyond Quantum Psychology\" and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and dealing with unacknowledged material within identities.",
  "content": "Take the label off of the False Core and have it as energy, and from inside ESSENCE, notice that the energy and the BIG EMPTINESS that it is floating in are made of the same substance. Feel that essential quality. Split your awareness in three ways: one-third in ESSENCE; one-third just noticing what, if anything, arises; and when you open your eyes in a moment, one-third in the room.

Resolving these issues can help you access the benefits of a stable, uninterrupted awareness of the Essential dimensions."
