  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it help in dismantling the False Core and False Self?",
  "first_phrase": "In Quantum Psychology, the goal is to dismantle the False Core and False Self, leading to the disappearance of both the dismantler and dismantlee, as well as the observer. Contrary to popular belief, this approach is not about accumulating students or winning popularity contests. Determining someone's False Core takes time, and it is not advisable to do so for personal gain. The last 200 tokens caution against trying to figure out someone's False Core as it may be a defense mechanism of one's own False Self. The author uses the example of a psychologist from Florida who diagnoses people, highlighting the potential dangers of trying to understand someone's psychology for personal motives.",
  "content": "I try never to tell anybody what False Core they are because I don't believe you can tell what somebody's False Core is by their outward behavior. I can tell what someone's behavior looks like (i.e., their False Self). Anyone can do that. I can say \"you are acting as if \"(0 in the blank)\" but I don't know if that's your False Core because I don't know what's motivating you or what is the driver behind this behavior. That's why it's difficult to tell what someone's False Core is. To identify the driver of someone's entire psychology is a tough number. 43 The Way of the Human Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Secondly, why would you want to spend time trying to figure out someone's False Core. It is oftentimes a False Self which is trying to \"get\" another's psychology so it does not have to feel its own False Core, or the age-regressed child trying to gain control through understanding, appreciating and then giving the appropriate response to Mom/Dad. To illustrate, I recently met a psychologist from Florida. She was very into diagnosising people.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, identifying someone's False Core is not easy, and it may not be a practical use of our time. Instead, we can focus on understanding and connecting with others by accepting them for who they are, without judgment or the need to diagnose them. By doing so, we can create meaningful relationships that can help us address our fears of feeling alone and ultimately, our sense of self-worth."
