  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author emphasized the importance of physical health and wellbeing as a prerequisite for intellectual and moral activities. The focus should be on achieving a state of health that allows us to have ardent desires and direct our surplus energy to our goals. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses the physiological and psychological aspects of consistent thinking and the role of the spinal column in this process. The spinal column acts as a channel through which thinking may flow, and special energy areas along it can be activated to enable the manifestation of energy. Additionally, the training of one's look has far-reaching significance.",
  "content": "Health and vitality are the foundations for giving expression to thought in the realm of reality. By norm, thought, in order to be effective, must be consistent with one's will and must express itself, from a physiological point of view, in a manner which is inherently harmonious both at the level of the cerebrospinal system and at the one of the sympathetic nerve system. Put it concisely, the entire organism must act consistently. In this regard, both the Westerners and the Eastern people draw attention to the important role played by manâ€™s spinal column in such a process (This is the power of the vertical line). From a physiological perspective, the marrow bone acts as the channel through which thinking may be able flow, by broadcasting it to the nervous system, and by simultaneously dispatching that information to the brain. Moreover, in accordance with the Indian tradition, a number of special energy areas (called chakras) are situated along the spinal column, and once such energy areas are activated in a coordinated fashion, they enable energy to manifest. Lastly, a far-reaching significance is enjoyed by the use and training of one's look.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, achieving consistency between our thoughts and actions, in a harmonious manner, is essential for health, vitality, and manifestation of energy. The spinal column, the channel of thought flow, and the activation of energy areas along it play a significant role. Moreover, the control of our look is equally essential as it is a manifestation of our will. It is important to develop both the organic and cellular part of our being while subjecting it to the control of our will."
