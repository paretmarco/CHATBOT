  "first_phrase": "In this final part, the paradoxical nature of trance states is explored. Trance is a state of deep absorption and disconnection from conscious processes, allowing a person to disidentify with certain attachments and reconnect with their essential identity. This is in contrast to analytical, conscious processes that tend to differentiate and categorize experiences. The therapeutic use of trance in Erickson's no-trance method is highlighted, where he focuses on the patient's symptomatology and helps them enter a more natural state of being. This section draws on insights from Gilligan's writing on the nonconceptual and nonverbal experiential state of unity that trance can provide.",

Whether experienced through hypnosis or meditative techniques, these trance states can lead to increased relaxation and a release from the constraints of the conscious mind, ultimately leading to a sense of well-being."
