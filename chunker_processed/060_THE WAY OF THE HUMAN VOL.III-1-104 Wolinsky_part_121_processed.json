  "title": "Is \"I am alone\" part of the collapse or essential to you? Exploring essential qualities of spaciousness.",
  "first_phrase": "In this final part of the text, Alice and Wolinsky explore the concept of the \"I am alone\" identity in relation to the collapse, false core, and container. Alice experiences a sense of spaciousness once these structures are gone beyond, leading to a deeper connection with others and a jelly-like quality to the Essential core. Wolinsky and Alice discuss how the container deceived her, and that while it is a part of her experience, it is not her. They also question whether there would be a \"you\" without the container or gravity. Alice describes feeling disoriented as she merges with everything else.",
  "content": "I feel a different connection with the whole room. How do you feel different? I am getting energy shots from everyone, like a veil has dropped. I feel like I am sitting feeling connected to everyone. Wolinsky:How does that Essential core seem to you now? Alice:A jelly quality. Therapeutic Note Since psychology is a by-product of the biology—no collapse, no psychology Wolinsky:Regarding the container how did it deceive you? Alice:Like I have to respond to it. Wolinsky:Is the \"I\" that feels like it has to respond to the container part of the container structure itself? Alice:Oh, yes. Therapeutic Note \"The experiencER is contained within the experience.\" Nisargadatta Maharaj Wolinsky:The container and the experience are part of the container—but it is not you? Alice:Yes. Wolinsky:If there was no container or gravity thing, would there be a \"you\"? Alice:Yes. Wolinsky:Where? Alice:I have no idea.Alice:Laughs... (Silence) There's a sense of all of me merging with every- Wolinsky:Can you describe how you would not be if therething else and I feel disoriented.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, our experience is contained within us, but it is not us. The container and the experience are part of the larger container structure, but our essential core is beyond words and cannot be described. Without the container and gravity, there would still be a \"you,\" but it is prior to anything we can conceptualize. Remembering these insights can lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us."
