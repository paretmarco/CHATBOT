  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing self-observation and becoming aware of our misidentifications can help us avoid amplifying our emotional responses to situations like rejection or hurt. By familiarizing ourselves with the process of crafting identities and identifying with them, we can shift our focus to the present and avoid getting lost in accumulated past experiences. Remembering this can help us navigate challenging situations with a greater sense of clarity and calmness."
