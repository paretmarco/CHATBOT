  "title": "How does the mirror trance-ference impact the development of self in relationships and in Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of the \"good enough mother\" and the importance of differentiation for the child's growth. The author, a practitioner of Quantum Psychology, highlights how in the ideal situation, the mother is able to mirror back to the child and allow for uniqueness and differentiation to emerge. However, the lack of differentiation can lead to \"trance-ference\" and expectations of magical mommy from partners. The author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging ESSENCE and essential qualities, not just personality. Ultimately, this approach allows for the fundamental connection and unity between individuals to remain intact while also fostering healthy differentiation.",
  "content": "For example, many women whom I have worked with and know, have said that their husbands expect them to give them everything they want, whenever they want it without their having to ask. These age-regressed men are trance-ferring magical mommy onto their wife or partner. The \"good enough\" mother is a little different in Quantum Psychology. Here, the \"good enough\" mother can mirror ESSENCE and essential qualities, not just personality. In order to do this, the mother must be able to acknowledge her own ESSENCE and being. This allows her to acknowledge the ESSENCE and being of her child, while simultaneously differentiating the child's ESSENCE from the child's identities while simultaneously realizing their underlying connection at the level of the underlying unity. For example, rather than the mother fusing together ESSENCE and personality when the child misbehaves by saying, \"You are bad,\" the mother can let the child know, overtly or covertly, that what they are doing is not okay, even while their ESSENCE and who they really are is untouched and perfect.",
  "last_phrase": "In Quantum Psychology, acknowledging ESSENCE and being allows for a \"good enough\" mother to differentiate their child's behavior from their innate perfection. By avoiding the trap of identity creation, mothers can strengthen the awareness of ESSENCE and weaken identities. Although rare, this practice can extend beyond motherhood and onto other spiritual connections."
