  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the focus is on an exercise that aims to identify the role of the mind in shaping our thoughts and emotions. The exercise involves asking ourselves, \"Who told me that?\" when a thought arises and realizing that it is the mind, condensed into the void, that informs our perception of reality. The author emphasizes that there is nothing personal about this process, and that the knower of the mind, or the 'I', is part of the mind itself. Once this realization occurs, the 'I' or knower disappears into nothingness. This idea is illustrated through a story about a man seeking happiness, and an interaction with Maharaj.",
  "content": "Not MY mind but THE MIND. Everything you know comes out of the mind, because you wouldn't know if you were happy or sad, or felt good or bad, or liked someone or didn'tâ€”if there weren't something in your mind telling you so. When a thought conies through your awareness and tells you that you like someone or hate someone or that you feel good or bad, ask yourself, \"Who told me that?\" Then answer \"The mind\" (i.e., condensed VOID). The purpose of this exercise is to become clear that it is the mind. The mind tells you that you feel good and you believe it, or you feel bad and you believe it. There is nothing personal about it. It is the mind (condensed VOID). It is the nature of the mind to always change its mind. It is your nature to be what you are and the mind's nature to be what it is. It is not personal because the \"I\" or knower of the mind is part of the mind itself. Once this is \"gotten\" the \"I\" or knower of the mind disappears and there is NOTHINGNESS.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding that it is the nature of the mind to change and not to take thoughts personally can be liberating. By recognizing that there is no \"my mind\" but only the mind and its thoughts, one can develop a greater sense of detachment and find freedom in renunciation."
