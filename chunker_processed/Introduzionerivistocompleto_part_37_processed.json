  "title": "What is Hypnotic Induction and How Can it Help You Achieve Deep Relaxation and Positive Change?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text focuses on hypnosis and its various applications in personal and professional settings. The author explains how hypnosis is an autogenous natural process that can be used to stop smoking, lose weight, heal fears, and eliminate limits we set for ourselves. The role of a hypnotist is that of a pilot who can alter a collision course with their passenger's needs. The text also describes the Enneagram tool, which can be used to communicate better at both personal and professional levels. The last 200 tokens provide a step-by-step guide to a hypnotic induction based on the Erickson model.",
  "content": "And while something inside you is changing, you can feel the temperature of the room, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground, I don’t know if you realize that your breathing is becoming calmer, and with every breath you are relaxing even more And while you can relax, and while you can feel the sensation of your closed eyes, I ask myself if you realize you can cradle yourself in a feeling of relaxation. And you can imagine being even more relaxed, and while you can feel the weight of your body, you can imagine how to enter in to a peaceful cloud, and you can feel that some parts of your body are relaxed and others can be even more relaxed, and you can let yourself be cradled in this feeling, and let yourself slide deeper into a feeling of sleepiness, I don’t know if you realize you can be even calmer than you think you can be. You can feel the air that passes through your nostrils, you can feel the touch of your clothes against your skin, and go further, my voice will accompany you. At this point, the subject is in a light, “trance-like” state; we can continue with the stairway suggestion to make him go into a deeper state of relaxation. “THE STAIRWAY” And while you relax, you can imagine being at the top of a magnificent stairway, and while you are at the top of this stairway, I’ll count from ten down to one and with every number you can imagine going down towards the bottom.",
