  "first_phrase": "This text provides insights into exercises that aim to achieve a strong presence and focus on oneself. The previous section of this text defines the concept of a perfectly conducted exercise, which is when there is no break in the continuity of attention while performing the activity. It emphasizes that the concentration should be well executed and not worried about at the same time. The last 200 tokens of the text explore some basic exercises that aim to help develop one's presence, gaze, and attention. These exercises include staring at a fixed point without blinking, maintaining eye contact, and controlling finger and arm movements while keeping the concentration fully engaged.",
  "content": "So while you work, think to the exercise, not to “the performance of the exercise”. Please consider this sentence, because the secret of success is wrapped in it. Memento. – Do not get exhausted in an effort to unduly prolong an exercise. At the beginning, when an exercise has been perfectly executed for a very short time, you can call yourself satisfied. Rather than prolong the duration for that day, you shall switch to a different exercise. Exercise 8 – arm folding Bend the arm on itself to touch the shoulder with your hand. Execute the movement slowly, controlling it, namely placing your attention on what you are doing and without any external thought. A similar exercise is well performed only when the mind does not distract, not even a moment. The brain must give sufficient impetus to the movement; attention has to follow this movement until the end. When you have learned to perform well in this exercise, practice it progressively for 2, 3, 4, 5 times. Alternate arms; perform the same by bending the leg on the thigh. Exercise 9 - The finger. Sit comfortably, one hand on the knee, keeping it closed except the middle finger that you will lengthen in the direction of the thigh. Raise and lower the finger slowly for 10, 15, 20 times. The exercise consists in not letting your attention ever detach from the swinging finger, this for longer each time. Exercise 10 - The funnel.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing these exercises can help improve concentration and mindfulness, leading to a more present and mindful lifestyle. It is important to remember not to exhaust yourself in trying to perfect the exercises, and to focus on mindfulness rather than performance. By integrating sub-sensorialties and paying attention to details in our surroundings, we can increase physical sensations, visual perception, and auditory awareness. Finally, incorporating exercises for body flexibility and neck rotation can help release tension and allow for better energy flow. Remember that the key to success in these exercises is consistency and persistence."
