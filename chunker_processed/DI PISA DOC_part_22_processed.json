  "title": "How can fascination and mental focus improve health and heal the psyche?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we delve deeper into Prof. Erminio Di Pisa's magnetic power and his therapy of the look. The text discusses the role of fear and anxiety in creating negative fascination and how we can use techniques such as fascination and Trataka to access a mental void and facilitate healing. The text also explores the use of the symptom as a tool for healing and describes the state of fascination as a reset for the mind. The text finishes by emphasizing the importance of continued training and control over mental chatter for obtaining emotional control.",
  "content": "The more you attain calm and emotional control, the more it will be possible for you to reduce the number of exercises and concentrate solely on the ones you feel are most beneficial for you. Never neglect, however, the exercises based on the look and the acquisition of control over your mental chattering. Prof. Di Pisa did not stop training his look daily even after years of assiduous practice, despite being always well trained in that regard.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by achieving emotional regulation and control over your thoughts, you can maximize the effectiveness of your exercises, allowing you to focus on those that provide the most benefit to you. Remember that the exercises that cultivate control over your visual attention and mental chatter should still be an essential part of your routine even with progress.  Like Prof. Di Pisa, continue to train your look every day to maintain your progress and continue to improve."
