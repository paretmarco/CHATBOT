  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author delves into the importance of acknowledging the external world and how it affects our perceptions. They use the example of gurus who are initially content with little but eventually become greedy for wealth and power due to the holographic relationship between external and internal dimensions. Ultimately, the author stresses the need to pay attention to the context in which we live and handle the external world. The section ends with two exercises aimed at stabilizing our awareness, one of which involves practicing with objects in the room.",
  "content": "Gurus come to America or to Europe and all of a sudden, their biology is ignited or their images (thinking dimensions) come up and they want money and power. Initially a Guru wears rags but soon they have to have silk, they have to have people waiting on them. Thus the external which is holographically related to the other dimensions brings up their uncooked seeds. So, ultimately, whether you think the external context is crazy or not crazy, you still have to acknowledge it. NOTICING THE DIFFERENCE' The following two exercises are open-eyed. The first one involves practice with objects in the room. When you try this exercise, you might want to practice with a small group since it is often clearer when you make eye-contact with a partner, then switch in the middle to another partner. Stabilizing Awareness: 'The following exercises are in Quantum Consciousness and Hearts on Fire. If you've done them and do not need a reviewâ€”skip these pages 74 Chapter V Look at an object in the room and then withdraw your energy from it, thus, eliminating the knowledge of the object along with the thought or impression (Vijnana Bhairava, Jaideva Singh).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, whether we acknowledge it or not, external contexts can have a profound impact on our lives. It is important to remain aware and observant of our surroundings, and practicing exercises such as stabilizing awareness can help us learn to withdraw our attention from external factors and focus inwardly. By doing so, we can cultivate a sense of inner peace and strength that can help us navigate the challenges that life can bring."
