  "title": "What is the relationship between the observer and the observed in quantum psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore the concept of the observer-observed dyad and introduce the concept of \"the WITNESS\" or the \"NOT-I-I\", which is the one who is aware of the observer-observed dyad and remains unaffected by it. We learn that the observer and the observed are one and arise and subside together as one unit. The NOT-I-I, being pure awareness, is the last way-station for awareness and the destroyer of the imagined separation of the observer from the observed, which creates the illusion of time. The text also mentions the \"Quantum Psychology Principle\" and an exercise to become aware of the space between the arising and subsiding of the observer-observed dyad.",
  "content": "The NOT-I-I appears \"later,\" or is more solified, than the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS or the no-me of Samadhi where awareness—as well as the WITNESS itself—dissolves because even the WITNESS has an AwarER and hence is an \"I-I.\" NOT-I-I EXERCISE #1 THE QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY BREAKTHROUGH Quantum Psychology had two breakthroughs regarding the observer. The first was the realization that, in reality, the observer and the observed are one unit which arises and subsides simultaneously. The second was that there is not one observer but rather an infinite number of observer-observed dyads. Each new experience has a different observer which arises and subsides with it. We use the word appear to denote an illusion of being, which it appears to have—but it does not have. 'The observer does not create what it observes. This is a great distortion. 144 Be aware, WITNESS, the space between the arising and subsiding of the observer-observed dyad. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: The \"NOT-I-I\" is the last way-station for awareness. It is the destroyer of the imagined separation of the observer from the observed whereby we imagine the observer came before the observed, which creates the illusion of time.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporate the \"NOT-I-I\" exercise in your meditation practice to experience the destroyer of the illusion of time and the imagined separation between the observer and the observed. Remember, the observer and the observed are one and the WITNESS is beyond both. Use this principle to go beyond Quantum Psychology and into the Way of the Human."
