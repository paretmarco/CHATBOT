  "title": "\"How can the direction of eye gaze enhance hypnosis and induce trance?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding paragraphs, the text discusses techniques for inducing hypnosis using eye contact. It emphasizes the significance of the left eye in increasing passivity and improving sensitivity to gaze. The text suggests the practice of alternating between the right and left eye to enhance the effect of hypnosis. In the last section, we see an explanation of how our perception of reality is formed through the interaction between our left and right eye. It underscores how manipulating eye contact can disrupt our perception of reality. The text is a fascinating read for anyone interested in hypnosis and the workings of perception.",
  "content": "Alternating gaze between eyes is the next technique and speaks to both brain hemispheresâ€¦ As we said, looking at the left eye enhances passivity in the person being looked at. We can increase this state looking firstly at the right eye for some seconds, and going to the left one and staying there afterwards. This method is stronger as looking always at the left eye. In starting a little on the right eye we will \"saturate\" it, and the effect we will create as we look at the left one will be stronger. As we proceed in our practice we can discover also another hypnotic gaze very useful in hypnosis. It will break away the pattern in which our subject understands and processes reality. Simply we will alternate very fast our gaze between right eye and left eye. And also here we can find a scientific explanation giving even more ground to this ancient method. We live in our map of the world. This map is based on our three-dimensional view of the world. 3-d view in turn is based on the interaction between the left eye and the right eye. We construct our daily three-dimensional reality through interaction between hemispheres.",
  "last_phrase": "Incorporating the technique of alternating gaze between the eyes can be a powerful tool in hypnosis, for it can enhance passivity and break subconscious resistance effectively. Furthermore, suggesting the idea of looking within oneself by fixing gaze at the nose can induce a trance-like state and intensify the hypnotic effect."
