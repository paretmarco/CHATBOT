  "title": "\"What is the Alchemy of Light and how can it lead to higher consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of \"presence\" and its practical consequences in human development towards higher self-awareness. It also discusses the \"Alchemy of Light,\" which reconnects to the hermetic tradition and techniques where light is a factor of help in facilitating the understanding of certain processes leading to better brain activation. The last 200 tokens provide an in-depth look at the Magnetic Path, which aims to connect the forces of nature to one's work and influence. The text also reveals the significance of learning FASCINATION and expanding the magnetic chain through a Personal Master Research and Development Project.",
  "content": "In order to see a tree, for instance, the neurons of the visual cortex must be activated in a manner which is different from the one that is needed when, to give an example, we discern a mountain. This very same concept is also at the heart of Pribram and Bohm’s holonomic theory: \"Every sense works like a lens, and thus refocuses the visual waves both by perceiving specific elements which are reiterated so as to establish an underpinning basis, and by perceiving distinct quantities. If we were to take the lenses off, only a hologram would be left”. Given that every sense works by refocusing in accordance with certain mechanisms, it is very difficult to regain access to the WHOLE. We might call this whole a \"totipotent whole\", by drawing a comparison with the concept of \"totipotence\" which is used in the biology relating to stem cells that are capable of growing in every cell of the organism. White light is a \"totipotent whole\", inasmuch as it encompasses all the colours in its quantum superposition. What we name reality is purely the light that gets reflected on the different objects. Every visible object is already potentially present in the white light. Many experiences share the experience of light. When we observe light and, even more significantly, when we are able to discern or imagine white light even if our eyes are shut, we are drawing close to the “totipotent field\", which is in turn quite closely related to the concept of \"quantum field\".",
