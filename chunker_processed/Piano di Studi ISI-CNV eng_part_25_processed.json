  "title": "What is the High Quality for Excellence course and how does it use NLP, NLP-3, and Hypnotic Communication to improve learning and mental energy?",
  "first_phrase": "The last 200 tokens refer to the final step of the Quantum Path and the concept of presence, which is the culmination of all traditions of self-seeking. The text explains that emotions exist only in specific contexts and situations, and in a superposition scheme until they are defined by measuring them. The text then explores the layers of consciousness and space-time, followed by the concept of the philosopher's stone and the Alchemy of Light. The last part also discusses the practical consequences of presence and the Quantum Presence Master in Quantum Physiology. It emphasizes the efficacy of NLP and NLP3 in improving communication skills. This new discipline is based on recent research and experience and is simpler in application. In the course, participants will learn new techniques that will enhance the efficacy of their practice.",
  "content": "NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) is a technique very diffused today for change and improvement of communication skills and NLP3 is a further development of NLP toward quantum thinking, called NLP 3. NLP3 is based on many experiments and also on integration of not verbal technology. Each technique explained has been practiced and tested hundreds of times with success. It is a very efficient way of thinking and operating going beyond the paths of mainstream NLP. While for example in NLP we have the word “linguistic”, in NLP3 we put much more emphasis on non verbal behaviour as this is a fundamental key for the efficacy of our discipline. While in traditional NLP we have the word “programming”, NLP3 has the goal to pave the way to the “quantum thinking” that it is completely different from programming. In Quantum thinking the mind is free. • If you are an NLPer, this is your occasion of learning something new that will further enhance your efficacy. • If you are new, you will start with the right foot. Most of the most successful teachers and practitioners use, at least unconsciously, many elements written in this book. Personally we find this methodology simpler in application than the old ones. In our centres we train psychotherapists and hypnotherapists, and we practise as well personal therapies, coaching etc… This is as a new discipline based on recent researches and on the successes we have got. Please, throw away all your past mental conditioning and open your mind to new frames of thinking: what you find here is the result of our experience!",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you are looking to enhance your communication, persuasion, personal magnetism, and coaching skills at a deeper level, then the courses of NLP-3, Hypnotic Coaching, Quantum Coaching, Hypno-Selling, Real Hypno-Mentalism, and Hypno-Magnetism can offer you a new and effective way of thinking and operating that goes beyond the traditional methods of NLP and hypnotherapy. These courses have been practiced and tested for their efficacy and offer international certifications upon completion. Enroll now to start your journey towards a new world of thinking and understanding the depths of the unconscious mind."
