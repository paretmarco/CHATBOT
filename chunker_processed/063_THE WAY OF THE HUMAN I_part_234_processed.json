  "title": "What is the concept of the Biological Core in Quantum Psychology and how does it relate to psychological issues and spiritualization?",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, Stephen H. Wolinsky delves into the ways in which trauma and interruptions in the body's natural flow of energy contribute to the creation of false cores and psychological issues. Drawing upon the insights of Moshe Feldenkrais and Wilhelm Reich, Wolinsky argues that the shock of realizing separation and deprivation can cause a break in awareness of the biological core, leading to a psychology that perpetuates mystification of the world. He suggests that aligning the biological core with the gravitational pull of the sun and earth can help eliminate beliefs and thoughts that contribute to this mystification.",
  "content": "The greater the trauma (breakages and interruptions), the greater the inability to release energy, and the more the cortex will create stories and reasons—an \"I\" and a \"you\"—to explain and justify what you call \"your psychology,\" etc. If this upward process continues, according to Reich, it perpetuates the mystification of the world (making it into a world of Gods and Goddesses (see the Trance of Spiritualization, Chaperl4, The Dark Side of the Inner Child). Quantum Psychology suggests as a story: 1) That the shock to your BIOLOGICAL CORE is mirrored at a psychological level and is solidified by the narcissistic injury (to be detailed in Volume II). 2) On an energetic level (a bioenergetic level), it is the uninterrupted flow of energy which occurs when the BIOLOGICAL CORE is aligned with the gravitational pull of the sun and the earth that helps to eliminate beliefs, thoughts, and mystifying the world (trance of spiritualization). This is why you feel so quiet \"inside\" after a \"body session—your psychology disappears! However, shortly afterwards, your psychology comes back because we still have to meet the problem at the level of the problem.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, Quantum Psychology suggests that our psychology, created as a survival mechanism by our body to cope with traumas and breakages, is not a world of gods and goddesses but a product of the illusion of a separate \"I\" and \"You,\" preventing us from realizing that we are all one indivisible substance. By aligning our biological core with the energy flow of the earth and the sun, we can eliminate beliefs and thoughts that mystify the world and experience a quietness inside ourselves. Ultimately, being present in the world is what our biological function and core are about."
