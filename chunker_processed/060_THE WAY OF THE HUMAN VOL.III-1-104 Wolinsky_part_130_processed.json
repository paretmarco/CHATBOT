  "title": "\"What is the ultimate Archetype and its relationship with consciousness and identity?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of the text, Wolinsky and Fred discussed the idea of consciousness and the observer-reflector-reflected process. In this final part, the discussion shifts towards the concept of the \"I AM.\" According to Nisargadatta Maharaj, the \"I AM\" represents the ultimate Archetype that remains unquestioned and is contained within most individuals. The idea is to hold onto the \"I AM\" and let go of everything else to undercut the False Core-False Self. The discussion concludes with a demonstration that defines the \"I AM\" as the place where one looks from and where people address them. The text highlights how individuals can deceive themselves by identifying and believing in themselves.",
  "content": "THE ULTIMATE ARCHETYPE THE I AM The I AM represents the ultimate Archetype. It is contained within most everyone, remains unquestioned, and you could not say anything is or was unless that I AM were there. Nisargadatta Maharaj's basic teaching was, \"Hold onto the I AM, let go of everything else.\" For \"him,\" the I AM was the root or seed from which your separate universe sprouted. To stay in the I AM and let go of everything else undercuts the False Core-False Self. He felt (\"I\" imagine) that ultimately this Archetype would disappear, at which point the realization that there is no \"you\" or \"I\" would be revealed. DEMONSTRATION #6 Define I AM. The place where I look fromâ€”the place where people address me. By your having this definition, the place where I look from and the place where people address me. What assumptions do you have? 128129 Chapter 111 Regarding I AM is a place you look from and \"my life,\" etc., how has the concept of I AM or I AM NOT deceived themselves? By identifying and believing in themselves.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing the power of the I AM archetype and fully embracing it while letting go of all externalities can lead to the realization of the false self and ultimate enlightenment. By understanding that I AM is the place where one perceives from and is perceived, individuals can become more aware of their assumptions and experience a deeper level of self-awareness."
