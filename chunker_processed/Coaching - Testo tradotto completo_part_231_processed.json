  "title": "\"What is the importance of having both a life plan and minor plans, and how should they be structured?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the author emphasizes the importance of creating minor plans to achieve specific objectives in one's life. The author suggests that while having grand ideals is important, it is equally crucial to focus on the practical aspect of our environment and work towards achieving smaller goals. The minor plans should be drafted considering one's age, health, means, and situation. The author also advises determining the extent of minor plans based on contingent circumstances. By following these minor plans and achieving smaller objectives, individuals can gradually work towards fulfilling their life plans.",
  "content": "ideals and directions Minor plans ? specific objectives As we draw up the yearly plan, we should pay regard to the program which has to be carried out in consonance with one's age, health, means, etc. It would be absurd to allocate, for example, the goal of being successfully appointed as member of parliament to the age of 20 years, assuming of course that such objective formed part of the life planâ€™ and it would likewise be absurd to exclude, from the plan for that age, the fulfilment of love-related aspirations, reserving all of them to the plan concerning the 70th year ! 56. Due to all the aforesaid reasons, while we might intelligibly retain all the supreme ideals linked to our overall lifetime, it will also be of practical relevance to successfully implement some minor plans comprising minor ideals, and to do so for longer or shorter periods, the extent of which should be left to contingent circumstances to determine. For example, a student might delineate his plan until the stage of his graduation, an artist might do so until the successful completion of a particular program, and the same would hold true of a merchant, a manufacturer, etc.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is important to have a well-thought-out life plan in accordance with age, health, and means while considering specific objectives. Along with retaining our supreme ideals, implementing minor plans with minor ideals for shorter or longer periods can be practical. The yearly plan can be divided into segments, articulated as a series of minor plans, with the ideal time unit being one year. Sub-dividing these yearly plans into monthly, weekly, and daily plans can help us achieve our goals efficiently."
