  "first_phrase": "In the last part of the text, the author explains how developing presence can lead to greater power and consciousness in our lives. The author argues that most people lack power because they lack consciousness and therefore spend their existence in single isolated moments without a continuous form of self-awareness. However, by increasing consciousness, a person can become powerful and, in turn, unravel the global design in their relationships with others. The author offers an exercise, \"The March,\" where one can practice walking without mentally guiding their march to help develop this type of presence.",
  "content": "To sum up: By moving forward on the road of developing presence, a person might become conscious not just of the specific instant, but even of the kind of action he is engaged in. A practitioner of this technique always knows what he is doing. Most human beings are unaware of what they are doing, and live only by the surface of their beings. This is what \"having power\" actually signifies to those who practice this technique. When this stage is reached, one becomes powerful, and he thus unravels the global design in his relationships with other people. How does one develop this type of presence? Here are some ideas. Exercise 53 – The march One exercise might consist in walking without mentally guiding one's march. We in fact inject many mental formulations into our act of walking. When, as we carry out this exercise, a certain point is reached, we become consciously aware of how “our own body wishes to walk”. Out flanks, too, become for instance free.",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, developing presence is key to becoming a powerful individual who can comprehend the global design in their relationships. The exercises presented, such as the march and enumeration, can help you achieve true coenesthetic perception and consciousness of your actions. By implementing these practices, you will free yourself from mental formulations and become powerful as you move forward in life."
