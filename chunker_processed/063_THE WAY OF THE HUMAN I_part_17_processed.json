  "title": "How does Quantum Psychology redefine pain and propose multi-dimensional awareness for achieving full humanity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, Quantum Psychology sees the cause of pain as substituting biological desires for psychological wants. However, many spiritual systems consider basic human experiences and emotions as undesirable. Enter the idea that emotional and psychological states are a necessary part of being human, and they contribute to our full humanity. In volume III of this work, we will discuss the VOID and NAMELESS ABSOLUTE. Here we will discuss the eight dimensions of manifestation in order to experience our full humanity. Confusing one dimension's function with another dimension's function causes confusion and pain. Understanding the functions of each dimension is critical.",
  "content": "When awareness of all of these eight dimensions are included and their functions understood, we can experience our full humanity. Briefly these eight dimensions are: One, the external world; two, the thinking world; three, the emotional world; four, the biological or animal dimension; five, ES- 3 The Way of the Human® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness SENCE; six, the no-state state of I AM; seven, Archetypes of the COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS; and eight, the \"NOT-I-I.\" How are some problems created? Unfortunately, our awareness of the different functions of these dimensions get confused. When this occurs, we confuse one dimension's function with another dimension's function. This causes confusion and pain. For example, attempts to change the thinking or emotional dimensions—i.e., ing to make them more unconditionally loving, compassionate, and forgiving—confuses the functions of these dimensions. In the above example, unconditional love or compassion are not qualities of the biological animal, thinking or emotional dimensions. Rather, these are the qualities of ESSENCE. Therefore, we must understand the different dimensions of consciousness and their functions.",
  "last_phrase": "To live a fulfilled and harmonious life, we must develop awareness of the eight dimensions of consciousness and understand their unique functions. Confusing the functions of different dimensions can lead to pain and problems in life. Therefore, it is important to allow each dimension to function without trying to override or change it. By doing so, we can experience our full humanity and live a life of balance and peace."
