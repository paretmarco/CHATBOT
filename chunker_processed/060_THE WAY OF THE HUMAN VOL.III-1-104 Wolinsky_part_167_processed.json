  "title": "\"What is the NOT-I-I exercise to cultivate void and awareness within oneself?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, titled \"Exercise #9 NOT-I-I\" we are guided through a series of steps to cultivate the possibility of VOID. In the last 200 tokens, the author brings us to Chapter IV where we move from experiencing the VOID within ourselves to seeing it in the external world. We are encouraged to notice our skin boundaries and work towards seeing through them, into the VOID of undifferentiated consciousness. Finally, the author reminds us that all these concepts are interesting ideas, but ultimately, we are just here, and that's an interesting idea too. This exercise helps us cultivate a sense of awareness and consciousness.",
  "content": "You also have to let go or notice the concept called solidness. Step VI:Let go or notice the concept called \"me.\" And get that \"me\" and \"I\" are both interesting ideas. Step VII: Notice the skin boundaries which are like a wall and see through the wall as also the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Now, notice there is a sense of consciousness or awareness of just being. You can just be there which is an interesting idea. Awareness is an interesting idea, nothing more. And consciousness, too, is an interesting idea. Notice how sound comes into \"your\" VOID but the idea that the sound is separate from you is an interesting idea. The idea that you have to condense down or are condensed down or the idea that you are thinned out is an interesting idea but nothing more. Now, if you are just experiencing you are just here with nothing going on, that's an interesting idea. Step IX:Certainly I AM is an interesting idea. So in a moment you can open your eyes and come back to the room.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, letting go of our concept of self and noticing the void of undifferentiated consciousness can lead to a deeper understanding of awareness and consciousness. When we see objects and people as both the object and the void simultaneously, we can experience an interesting and enlightening perspective. As we move forward, it is important to remember that symbols are simply tools for our minds, but the true essence of existence lies beyond them."
