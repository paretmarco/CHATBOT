  "title": "How can suggestive self-massage keep you youthful?",
  "first_phrase": "This text describes different exercises and techniques for body massage to help prevent aging. Before the last 200 tokens, the author talks about the importance of abdominal exercise and reducing congestion in the muscles and tissues of the body. In the last 200 tokens, the text moves on to specific techniques for body massage, explaining how they affect the body and the importance of maintaining flexibility and extensibility in the spine and neck to prevent aging. The author also discusses how certain muscles can be contracted and released for their decongestant and renewing effects, which can be superior to traditional massage in some ways.",
  "content": "La bio e il collo possono venire spremuti nello stesso Moda, come sarà facile accorgersi applicando lateralmente le' dita sul collo che si sentirà indurire straordinaria­mente. LO, stesso si dica del petto. Lo stesso si può dire di ogni muscolo del corpo. La manovra di contrazione e di allentamento ha un effetto decongestionante rinno­vatore di prima ordine e noi crediamo che sotto certi riguardi essa superi in efficacia lo stesso massaggio.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, the contraction and relaxation technique can be applied to any muscle in order to achieve a remarkable revitalizing effect. By gently applying lateral pressure to the neck and chest, one can feel an incredible hardening of the bio (life energy). This technique is a superior way to invigorate the body and, in some aspects, it may surpass the effects of a regular massage. Give it a try and experience the incredible benefits for yourself!"
