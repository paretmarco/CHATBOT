He remembers the confronting teachings and lessons that expanded his perspective and led him to discover the ultimate irreverence for personal identities and concepts. Dr. Wolinsky's work includes Integrating Hypnosis with Psychotherapy and Family Therapy, as well as his books The Tao of Chaos and Hearts on Fire.",
  "content": "-71117\"r--- DEDICATION To the memory of my teacher, Guru and Guiding Light, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, the grandfather of Quantum Psychology, the ultimate deprogrammer, and the most confrontive teacher I have ever encountered. To the memory of that confrontation which forced me to look at what I had not looked at, confront what I did not know I needed to confront, question what I did not know I needed to question, and let go of that which I did not know I was holding on to. With love and gratitude for facing-off with me, infecting me with the virus of enquiry which destroys everything in its path including the enquirer. For showing the ultimate irreverence for Identities and concepts which I thought were me and mine, and the ultimate reverence for THAT ONE SUBSTANCE and BEYOND. To the memory of Bagawan Nityananda whose appearance from the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE changed the course of \"my\" life. To Shirdi Sai Baba who showed me the NAMELESS ABSOLUTE which \"I\" at first could not handle or understand. And who 19 years later showed \"me\" the meaning of his words \"I give them what they want, so that they will want what I have to give.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the profound dedication to Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and other spiritual teachers played a pivotal role in the creation and development of Quantum Psychology, with its core beliefs centered around Advaita Vedanta. The fundamental principles of Quantum Psychology, which revolve around the idea of ONE SUBSTANCE and self-discarding, can help individuals achieve greater self-awareness and connect with the ultimate truth beyond the limitations of identities and concepts."
