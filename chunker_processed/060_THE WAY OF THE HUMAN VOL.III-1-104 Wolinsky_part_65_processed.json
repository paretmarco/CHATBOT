  "title": "How does separating false identities lead to experiencing essence in quantum psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this therapy session, Debra and Wolinsky continue exploring her identity as a regressed little girl. Wolinsky asks Debra to separate her identities and take off the \"little girl\" mask to reveal her true essence. They discuss the importance of acknowledging separation at different levels while maintaining a relationship at the level of essence. Debra practices this with her parents and ultimately feels solid in her newfound understanding.",
  "content": "Notice we are separate and let the relationship be between your ESSENCE and my ESSENCE simultaneously. Notice that you have a relationship ESSENCE to ESSENCE and have simultaneously separation from me. 64 Chapter 1 Therapeutic Note This is very importantâ€”acknowledging separation at a biological, thinking and emotional level, and the total relationship at the level of ESSENCE and BEYOND. Debra:Yeah, hmrn. That answers that. I would like for you to look at your mom and to experience your ESSENCE and look at her ESSENCE so you notice the separation at a biological-thinking-emotional level, and simultaneously you notice the ESSENCE to ESSENCE relationship. It's a little harder, but yeah I could do that. Do that with your dad. It's easier to do it with mom. Notice the men out there. Notice the ESSENCE to ESSENCE relationship but there's also a separation at other levels. Yeah, this is what I was feeling with John the other night. I still love him but as a separate person on that level. Wolinsky:How are you doing now? Debra:Good, I like the way that feels. I feel very solid. Wolinsky:Good.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to acknowledge the separation at different levels of a relationship while also recognizing the essence-to-essence connection, take the time to experience and observe the biological, thinking, and emotional levels. This can help you develop a strong sense of self and a deeper understanding of your relationships with others."
