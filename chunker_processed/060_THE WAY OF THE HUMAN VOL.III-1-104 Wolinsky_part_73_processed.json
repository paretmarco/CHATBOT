  "title": "\"What is the Quantum Psychology principle behind stabilizing the I AM and going beyond the False Core-False Self?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, we dive deeper into the concept of the False Core-False Self and the I AM according to Nisargadatta Maharaj's principles. Quantum Psychology explains how dismantling enough of our false self could reveal the pure being of the I AM. Some people mistake I AM as a construct, but it is a non-verbal experience beyond description or labeling. This principle is essential to understand that the description of a thing is not the thing.",
  "content": "Everything you know about yourself came from outside of you—therefore, discard it. 5. Hold on to the I AM—let go of everything else. 6. The only way to find out who you are is to find out who you are not. 7. To let go of something, you must first know what it is. 8. The experiences is contained within the experience itself. 9. Anything you know about you cannot be. According to Quantum Psychology, this was a lot to ask in a Western culture. Following Nisargadatta's principles, Quantum Psychology found that if you dismantle enough of your False Core-False Self, the I AM which is pure being beyond ESSENCE is revealed. The I AM stands between the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS and ESSENCE. I AM ERRORS Some people think that Nisargadatta Maharaj's I AM is a construct. I continually meet people who believe that you can create I AM as a primary experience. The NON-VERBAL I AM is beyond and prior to the label I AM. The NON-VERBAL I AM has no qualities, it is prior to description or label and is actually unnamable.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to truly understand who you are, you must let go of everything you have learned about yourself, including your False Core-False Self, and hold on to the NON-VERBAL I AM, which is unnamable and beyond description or label. By recognizing the different stages of the experiencER-experience or knowER-known, they disappear, and you can reach a state of pure being beyond essence - the I AM. Try the I AM exercise by tracing the source of the \"T\" thought and experience each stage until you reach the stage of \"Quanturn-fying.\""
