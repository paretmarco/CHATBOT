  "title": "\"How can we plan for long-lasting pleasure and avoid becoming numb to repeated stimuli?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author explores different categories of pleasures, ranging from daily gratification to rare and unique experiences. This final section delves into how to attain ongoing pleasure, which requires a certain mental attitude to avoid becoming desensitized to stimuli. The text also discusses the difference between pain and pleasure and the importance of planning for long-term pleasure. The author emphasizes the need to work on rare pleasures bit by bit on a steady basis, taking care to not view them as usual fare.",
  "content": "Pain and pleasure, in fact, are two such narrow peaks that one can only be in a state of balance atop them for no more than a flashing moment 61; by contrast, happiness and unhappiness represent two states. Normally, pleasure is experienced by many people only within the “change in state” which is the consequence of a stimulus. It is however a physiological law that repeated equal stimuli will turn the recipient organism insensitive. Accordingly, in order for pleasure to endure, what we need is either for the stimulus to be constantly stronger, or for it to be rare enough to enable the organism to welcome it as if it were a novelty. In order for one to keep on tasting pleasure, it is therefore necessary that he should have a certain mental attitude, which ensures that gratifications are not swallowed by our mind as a result of such mind viewing them as usual fare.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, pleasure is fleeting, and in order to sustain it, one needs an appropriate mental attitude to prevent it from becoming mundane. Pleasure fades with repetition, and its initial intensity and duration decrease with each subsequent occurrence. To prolong pleasure, it needs to be rare or stronger, akin to the concept of time."
