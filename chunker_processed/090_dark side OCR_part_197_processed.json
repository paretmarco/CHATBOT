  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the attitude needed for spiritual growth and shares a story from their visit to Nisargadatta Maharaj, their teacher in India. They emphasize the importance of confronting and dismantling spiritual beliefs and structures to truly know oneself. The author then explores the trance of \"spiritualizing\" and how it develops in early childhood through idealizing parents as gods and goddesses. To understand this concept fully, they explain primary and secondary processes in psychotherapy.",
  "content": "You must not be pacified with your spiritual game, rather you must confront and dismantle your spiritual beliefs and the spiritual structures of your mind to find out who you are. To do this, and with this in mind, let us explore the trance of spiritual- izing. Spiritualizing a 125 Spiritualizing One of the most involved and intricate trances of the inner child is \"spiritualizing.\" The spiritualizing trance develops as an infant and moves through several normal, developmental phases. This chapter will explore the processes of these developmental phases and show how they can lead the child to the trance I call spiritual- izing. I distinguish three phases of development and call them first, second, and third level processes. The first level begins as the infant believes that she creates her parents' actions or, what is commonly called in the psychological world, \"magical thinking.\" In the second level, the child idealizes the parent. In the third phase, an infant makes the parents into gods and goddesses. Spiritualizing, then, is the third of these levels. To understand what I mean by spiritualizing it is essential to look first at what are known traditionally in psychotherapy as primary and secondary processes.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly discover who you are, it's crucial not to be satisfied with just playing the spiritual game. Rather, you must actively confront and dismantle your spiritual beliefs and structures. By understanding the developmental phases that lead to the trance of spiritualizing, you can start questioning your own assumptions and strive towards a more authentic understanding of yourself and the world around you."
