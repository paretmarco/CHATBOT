  "title": "What is the connection between attention, energy, and the enteric nervous system?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the text delves deeper into the concept of finding your inner energy and the importance of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS). The author explains that attention is energy and should be directed to the present moment. This is exemplified by Perceval, who gains strength by freeing himself from the world of appearances and staying in the center. The author also explains the importance of the Hara, a center of force that connects to the ENS, and suggests exercises to activate it. Additionally, the author explores the concept of Vitriol, which means to go to the interior of the earth to find the hidden stone. Finally, the text explains the vital role of the ENS, a complex nervous system located in the gastrointestinal area that controls the digestive system and is interconnected with the brain.",
  "content": "Most probably all psychoactive drugs have an e ect on the ENS. Furthermore, current research about the ENS seems to have found correspondences to the ethnomedical concept of the lower Dantian (traditional Asian medicine), Swadhisthana (Hindu Trantrism), and the Sacral orange-colored chakra (New Age). This center is the key of access to the ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM also called ENS. ENS controls the gastrointestinal system in humans. It contains 100 million neurons, and the brain contains ~100 billion (±20%). It is located in the gastrointestinal area. The ENS can be considered part of the collective whole called the autonomic nervous system (ANS), but also as an independent system of its own. ANS controls various systems, including the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, urinary, reproductive, and integumentary (hair, skin, nails)—all of which are considered to function below the level of consciousness. The CNS and ENS are in strong communication with one another (via the BGA, brain–gut axis), and similar neurotransmitters can be found in both. The neuroplasticity of the ENS has not yet been studied.Medical studies of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) analyze the role of the brain–gut axis (BGA) in detail. It seems that the BGA is involved in various important physiological processes (regulation of glucose and fat metabolism, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and even in bone metabolism).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a crucial role in controlling the gastrointestinal system, and recent research has found links to traditional Eastern and New Age concepts. While the ENS is part of the larger autonomic nervous system (ANS), it can also function independently. The neuroplasticity of the ENS has yet to be fully explored, but studies on the brain-gut axis (BGA) have shown that the ENS may have a metacontrol role. Therefore, understanding the ENS and its relationship with the CNS is important for overall health and wellbeing."
