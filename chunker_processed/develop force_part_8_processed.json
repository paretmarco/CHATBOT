  "title": "What is the power of the eye and how can it be used for healing and personal growth?",
  "first_phrase": "This last part of the text focuses on the power of the eye and its correlation to achieving astonishing results. The author introduces the reader to the concept of fascination, a technique used by healers and masters to influence others actively. The text mentions the late Prof. Erminio of Pisa, who was introduced to this discipline by a master named Prof. Caravelli. This technique has remained hidden up to now and has been transmitted through direct master-to-disciple transmission without resorting to written texts. The author presents a detailed analysis of this subject and its practical applications in everyday life, such as developing one's charm and leadership abilities.",
  "content": "This is a technique that we are going to lay out in the second part of the book. Prof. Erminio, too, had been directly introduced to this discipline by an existing master: Prof. Caravelli. The latter was a masterful expert in the so-called art of “bi-location”, so much so that he could be simultaneously perceived in two different places. That is how we have made our acquaintance with this technique, which is as ancient as it is beneficial. These keys had remained hidden up to now. Indeed, although, since the days of the most remote past, testimonies had been adduced of people who were able to exercise a powerful influence with the look, the true method of bringing that about had in fact always been kept secret, or at least transmitted only on condition of maintaining a high degree of confidentiality. Even a very committed devotee of this type of subjects such as William Atkinson, who is one of the few people to have consecrated an entire book to the subject, one that bears the title of “Mental Fascination” 4, deals with it from the outside, in the process mentioning that he had interviewed some people, while clarifying the fact that had not been personally initiated to the technique. Likewise, Seligmann, a German ophthalmologist who authoured in this regard a monumental work comprising more than 2500 literary sources he had quoted therein, had never been let in the art from inside. Accordingly, as with many authors in the field, he offers us a puzzle without however being able to provide us with a true solution to it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the art of fascination through the eyes is an ancient technique that has been kept secret for centuries, but has the power to captivate people and exert influence. By training and educating the eye, one can develop a penetrating and expressive look that can be used in everyday life, in therapeutic contexts, and for personal growth. The eye has always been a symbol of knowledge, light, and individuality in human culture, and by understanding and utilizing its power, we can open new doors in life and achieve our goals."
