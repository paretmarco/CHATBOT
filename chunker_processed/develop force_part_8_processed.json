  "title": "What is the power of the eye and how can it be utilized for therapeutic and personal growth?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text focuses on the power of the eye and its correlation with astonishing results in terms of human influence. The text mentions ancient therapeutic traditions, as well as Prof. Erminio from Pisa and his study of astrology, which contributed to the completion of this work on the subject. The author shares their own experiences and their realization that disciplined work upon one's self is required to attain such power. The succeeding text discusses the ancient art of \"bi-location\" and the secrets of fascination that have remained hidden until now, with the present book being the world's most profoundly comprehensive text on the subject.",
  "content": "This is a technique that we are going to lay out in the second part of the book. Prof. Erminio, too, had been directly introduced to this discipline by an existing master: Prof. Caravelli. The latter was a masterful expert in the so-called art of “bi-location”, so much so that he could be simultaneously perceived in two different places. That is how we have made our acquaintance with this technique, which is as ancient as it is beneficial. These keys had remained hidden up to now. Indeed, although, since the days of the most remote past, testimonies had been adduced of people who were able to exercise a powerful influence with the look, the true method of bringing that about had in fact always been kept secret, or at least transmitted only on condition of maintaining a high degree of confidentiality. Even a very committed devotee of this type of subjects such as William Atkinson, who is one of the few people to have consecrated an entire book to the subject, one that bears the title of “Mental Fascination” 4, deals with it from the outside, in the process mentioning that he had interviewed some people, while clarifying the fact that had not been personally initiated to the technique. Likewise, Seligmann, a German ophthalmologist who authoured in this regard a monumental work comprising more than 2500 literary sources he had quoted therein, had never been let in the art from inside. Accordingly, as with many authors in the field, he offers us a puzzle without however being able to provide us with a true solution to it.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination through the eyes is a powerful technique that has been used since ancient times for various purposes such as persuasion, therapy, and personal growth. While the true method of exercising this power has been kept hidden and the subject is explored by many authors without being able to provide concrete solutions, training and educating the eye towards a fixed, penetrating, and expressive look can lead to mastering this power. Understanding the eye's role in human culture and its potential in developing intuitive faculties can also enhance the practice of fascination."
