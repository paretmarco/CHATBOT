  "title": "How does fascination work in hypnosis and what are its benefits?",
  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the use of hypnotic gaze induction to achieve various phenomena, such as somnambulism and amnesia. It highlights the importance of planning ahead, entering a state of \"no thinking\" and achieving a sense of \"presence\" to enhance the power of fascination. The text also mentions Franz Anton Mesmer and his practice of \"animal magnetism\", which included the use of fascination. The last part emphasizes the importance of deep telepathic connection between the practitioner and the subject, which can only be achieved by planning ahead and achieving a higher state of consciousness.",
  "content": "Therefore you can easily and we could say \"mathematically\" plan ahead exactly what you want to achieve, as for example somnambulism, amnesia, regression etc... Planning ahead is also necessary for other reasons. For fascinating you should enter yourself in a state of \"no thinking\". You too you do not have to use your rational mind in operating. The best results are achieved as you are in a particular state, called \"presence\", central to many esoteric schools, as for example the school of Gurdjeff, the ch'an and some spiritual alchemical paths in the western tradition. It greatly enhances the power of fascination. And finally you need to plan ahead because the subject will \"feel\" what is happening from your eyes and from the first moment in some deep and telepathic way. Franz Anton Mesmer, from whom the name \"Mesmerism\" is derived, included fascination in his practice of \"animal magnetism\". He said that magnetism could be transferred through the eyes to another person. He observed that this force was deeply connected to the instinctual part of man and he did in his life also a period of 3 months where he arrived to stay without any internal dialogue.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, fascination can be a powerful tool for achieving various outcomes such as somnambulism, amnesia, regression, and healing. To achieve the best results, it is important to plan ahead, enter the state of \"no thinking,\" and work with the \"animal mind\" of the subject. By using fascination techniques, you can make seemingly miraculous changes in your clients and achieve your desired outcomes."
