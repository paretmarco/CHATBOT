  "title": "\"How to create a successful life plan and find happiness through innate tendencies and pleasurable commitments?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 words of this text, the focus is on how to set up a life plan that can regulate future activities by maintaining harmony between all its parts. The author emphasizes the importance of tracing the direction of one's life orientation and not diverting from it. They suggest that every individual is born with certain innate generic tendencies, and opposing these tendencies can render them barren. Instead, setting up conditions that favor the development of these connatural predispositions can make us useful to others and secure a happy life for ourselves. To clarify, the author provides examples, such as a skinny person will not dream of becoming an athlete, nor will a person with a natural musical talent find felicity working as a mining engineer.",
  "content": "By keeping a watchful eye on the different elements that make up the plan, you will establish the minimum programming of its future activities, taking care, in the process, especially to fulfil the need to maintain harmony between all its parts. What is required at this stage is not that one should establish in full detail what he would like to do from the day in question until the end of his life, but, rather more simply, to trace the direction he is going to face henceforth. If such a general orientation will be a reliable reflection of our inward being, we might then decisively promise ourselves never to deflect from it. Each one of us is in fact born with certain innate generic tendencies. Opposing such tendencies will result in rendering them barren. By contrast, to set up conditions which favour the development of such connatural predispositions means we are going to make ourselves useful to others in the best possible manner and, at the same time, secure a happy life for ourselves. Having recourse to some elucidating examples, we might say that no skinny person will dream of becoming an athlete, nor will a natural musical talent imagine his self reaching felicity by working as a mining engineer.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by establishing a well-thought-out plan, taking into account our innate tendencies and external circumstances, we can commit to fulfilling our potential and creating a fulfilling life while experiencing pleasure along the way. The key is to maintain harmony between all parts of the plan and remain committed to the general orientation that reflects our inner being."
