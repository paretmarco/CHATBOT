  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the article discusses the concept of the \"inner child\" and how it can create distorted dreams that can interfere with reality. The article presents an example of a woman who was so love addicted to an abusive man that she could not let go of the dream that he would change. The text suggests several exercises to help individuals awaken from the past identity of the inner child and connect with present reality. The Dark Side of the Inner Child is a concept that refers to the problematic aspects of one's inner child, which when left unchecked, can lead to unhealthy patterns of behavior.",
  "content": "I worked with a woman who was so love addicted to an abusive man that the child within' s dream would not let go. After years of therapy, she continually chose the dream rather than the reality; she dreamed he would change. (He never has). I mention this example because she never gave up the dream, or the abusive man, so intense was her inner child's trance. This dream now comes from the child within the adult, not the present time observer. The task is to wake-up the present time observer from the past time child identity that is dreaming. This is done with the following exercises: 1. Ask yourself where in your body you feel the child who is dreaming. 2. Intentionally create a dream and place it inside the body part where the dreaming child resides. 3. Notice the difference between you and the inner child' s dream. 4. Create the dreaming child several times. The dream is deeply layered in the child and often becomes a major, motivational impetuous for the adult, as a lifestyle or rationale for ongoing behavior.",
  "last_phrase": "Unawareness of our inner child's dreams can lead to unconsciously living out our childhood traumas as adults. It's essential to wake up the present-time observer from the trance dreaming of the inner child, and with exercises like creating a dream and noticing the difference between it and reality, we can break free from the past and choose a different path."
