  "title": "\"How can mental attitude, scanning, and purging help to achieve a balanced and successful life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we learn the importance of mental attitude and visualization in achieving our goals. The author emphasizes the need to harmonize our volitional urges with natural elements, and not just focus on material objectives. However, the author acknowledges the possibility of errors in our visualization and urges us to constantly scan and compare our desired outcomes to our actual results. By doing so, we develop a \"causal sense\" that enables us to make better decisions. Moments of rest are ideal for this exercise.",
  "content": "Therefore, as we build the mental images, it might happen that we are going to omit some essential particulars, and that, even though the generic concept might be given effect to, the consequential results which are produced differ from the ones we had expected to witness. It is then by drawing on our memory, and by comparing what is actually unfolding to what we had desired, that one manages to realize the omissions and the mistakes we are inclined to fall into, and to accordingly centralize, so to speak, our way of conceiving and willing. After all, by scanning whatever has forced its way onto our attention for some time already, viz. the trend of our business affairs, the new people we have established contact with, the diverse occurrences we have been active participants in, and by seeking to identify the relationship they display vis-à-vis our previous moods, our learning curve will expand tremendously, and we will be able to develop that «causal sense», the sharpness of which enables us to steer our physical and psychological activity to the utmost possible level of judiciousness. The moments of relax and rest are those which are best suited to this particular exercise.",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, building accurate mental images requires us to compare reality with our expectations and identify any mistakes. To do this, we should use our memory and analyze our daily experiences to develop our causal sense. Finally, as an ongoing practice, we should be mindful of the general law governing psychological actions and purge our minds of negative and unproductive thoughts. By following these steps, we can attain the highest level of judiciousness in our personal and professional lives."
