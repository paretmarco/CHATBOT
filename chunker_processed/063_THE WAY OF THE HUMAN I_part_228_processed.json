  "title": "What is the connection between the biological core and the interconnection and oneness of everything according to Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author discusses the biological realization of interconnection and oneness with everything. The text emphasizes the importance of dropping past time body images and restoring the sense of strength and stability through the spine. They mention Reich's term \"vegetative\" and explain how it relates to psycho-spiritual work. Furthermore, the text warns bodyworkers not to fall into the trap of assuming that handling the body will also handle the associated images. It is crucial to handle them at the thinking dimension. The author shares a personal experience of feeling one with another person's biological essence.",
  "content": "This is the biological realization of the interconnection and oneness of everything. It is truly a physical experience. To illustrate, several years ago I was giving a workshop in Kansas City. There was a woman there who was deeply age regressed and even began singing. When I lost awareness of \"my\" BIOLOGICAL CORE, I felt really separate from her.\" I noticed, however, that when I dropped into my own BIOLOGICAL CORE, I felt one with her BIOLOGICAL CORE. I could see the pain in her eyes and felt the essential biological experience of compassion. It should be noted again that body workers should not fall into the trap that \"if we handle the body, the images too will get handled.\" Not so. This has been a major flaw of understanding in many of the most popular systems and subsystems of today, i.e., Feldenkrais and Rolfing. The images of the body, as well as the body itself, are holographic. However, you need to follow the Quantum 141 The Way of the Human â€¢ Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness Psychology Principle: Meet the problem at the level of the problem. If there is an image problem, handle it at the thinking dimension.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the understanding of the interconnection and oneness of all things extends beyond a mere concept to a physical experience. However, body workers must be careful not to assume that handling the body automatically solves all issues, as images and emotions also play a role. By addressing the problem at the appropriate level, dismantling images can lead to greater access to the biological core and essence, ultimately enhancing the re-education of body awareness for faster results."
