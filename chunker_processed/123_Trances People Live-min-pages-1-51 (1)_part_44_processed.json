  "title": "How can a story of lost count be applied in therapy to access the client's creative self behind the symptom?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous paragraphs, the author discussed the role of the creative self in therapy and how it can affect the success or failure of the trance state. They propose that every client who presents a problem or symptom is also presenting a trance state. In the last 200 tokens, the author tells a story of individuals counting themselves and realizing that they have lost someone. A sage comes and counts each person, revealing that there were actually 10. The story's translation in therapy is that the therapist must observe the autonomous clusters of trance phenomena that reveal themselves to better help the client.",
  "content": "For me it change the means that the therapist learns to communicate with the creative being, the \"self,\" behind the trance; it is the self that can ceeds or fails trance and hence the symptom. The reason therapy suc pist, or to the severity or is not always due to the skill of the thera always due to the trance states tenacity of early traumas; nor is it themselves. It can be due to the being as a creative self. As I have said, it is my view that whenever a client presents a problem or symptom to me, he or she is also presenting a trance state. Symptom structures are supported by Deep Trance Phenom- enon that come in clusters and form an internal latticing of associations and responses that the person experiences as problem- atic. These clusters of trance phenomena will reveal themsel ves in an autonomous fashion to the observant therapist. I mentioned the alcoholic client who, as the session tit ifolded, spontaneously began to age regress. I requested that she maintain continued eye contact with me during the regression.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is essential for therapists to communicate with the creative self behind the trance and identify the underlying Deep Trance Phenomenon that supports the client's symptom structures. By observing and recognizing these clusters of trance phenomena, therapists can help clients access their unconscious resources and break free from their automatic response patterns, resulting in a successful therapy outcome."
