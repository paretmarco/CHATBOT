  "title": "\"What happens when you fuse emptiness with 'I am alone'?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Chapter IV, Wolinsky and Claudia explore the concept of the BIG EMPTINESS, delving into how the belief structure of \"I am alone\" can cause a sense of separation, alienation, and imprisonment when fused with the emptiness. They examine how separating these two concepts leads to peace, expansiveness, and calmness. In the following 200 tokens, Wolinsky and Claudia discuss what does not occur when the emptiness is separated from \"I am alone.\"",
  "content": "Conclude that the separation means I am alone. Notice how the BIG EMPTINESS becomes the small emptiness (as in a lack) and becomes the trigger for \"I am alone.\" Right. Now, keeping the awareness of the emptiness infused with the belief structure, \"I am alone\" and concluding that this emptiness is a proof of that. If you fuse together \"I am alone\" with the emptiness, what are you creating? Separation, alienation, tightness, prison. If you fuse together emptiness and alone, what are you not creating? Not creating not creating. Good. And if you fuse this emptiness with I am alone, what are you resisting? The emptiness. Now, if you separate the emptiness from I am alone, take a moment to do that. In other words, allow the conclusion and all the energy of that conclusion to separate from the emptiness. If you separate that, what is the experience? 149 The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Claudia:It's quiet, peaceful, expansive, calm, EMPTY (BIG), not a whole lot going on. Wolinsky:If you separate it, what does not occur?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, separating the belief of \"I am alone\" from the feeling of emptiness creates a sense of peace, calm, and expansiveness rather than confinement and isolation. By separating the two, one can resist the lack of boundaries that the fusion of the two may have created and move towards a more positive experience."
