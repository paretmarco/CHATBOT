  "title": "\"How can visualization and self-persuasion help achieve a grand idea despite obstacles?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous part of this text, the author discussed how a grand idea can only materialize after smaller ideas have been put into practice. In the last 200 tokens, the author explains how obstacles are bound to arise, but it's crucial to firmly entrench in oneself the belief that obstacles represent only an accessory on the path to success. The author discusses the faculty of \"foretelling\" and how continuously envisioning oneself in a modified state can lead to natural and unperceivable stages of modification. The text also explores the idea that cerebral ideational automatism is going to occur when one starts from the premise of a self-persuasive movement.",
  "content": "Well, it serves the function of firmly entrenching in us this most important conviction, namely, that obstacles merely represent the accessory, and that the successful achievement is a certain reality so long as we want it, given that the concatenation has been proven to be a logical one. The faculty of “foretelling” is immensely helpful even with regard to what the self-persuading element which is implied by premonition. Whoever has set himself in motion as a result of having dreamt a particular state, will come across a far lesser number of difficulties on the path of its actualization. By continuously keeping inside ourselves, through “daydreaming”, a vision of our “own self” as being modified, the modification will then end up materializing in a most natural manner, through stages which are unperceivable, though each one of them is “sparked into being” (so to speak) at the right moment. After all, if one pays notice to how easy it is to induce in ourselves a form of muscular automatism by starting from the premise of a self-persuasive movement, it ought to be concluded a fortiori that a cerebral, ideational automatism is going to occur.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by continuously visualizing our desired self and using self-persuasion techniques, we can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving our goals. By pre-determining the outcome and programming our minds for success, we can overcome obstacles and achieve success with near-mathematical certainty. So, start daydreaming and self-persuading yourself towards your desired outcome today!"
