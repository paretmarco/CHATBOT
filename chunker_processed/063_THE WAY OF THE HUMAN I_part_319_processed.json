  "title": "How does trance-ference distort our perception of present-time relationships and impact our humanity?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, it was emphasized that unknowingly imagining and treating someone as a parent or child requires going into an age-regressed trance. This trance-ference causes us to lose awareness of our present-time body and distorts our perception of ourselves and the world. As a result, we lose our human nature and collapse the dimensions of manifestation. In the final part, the author delves deeper into how pre-verbal and pre-conscious cognitive understanding distorts reality and prevents us from experiencing present time, and how dismantling the powerful trance of trance-ference can lead to stabilizing our Quantum nature.",
  "content": "To lose body awareness is to lose that relationship. Quantum Psychology says that when everything is seen as the same substance, nobody is an individualâ€”rather, everything is seen as the same substance, including the body. This is the realization of, I AM THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. It is through trance-ference that we lose our present-time body experience, we lose the present time external world (seeing the past time external world) and we imagine and, hence, see, think and feel the other person as a significant other from the past. In short, we collapse the dimensions of manifestation. It is our pre-verbal and pre-conscious cognitive understanding which acts as a lens and which distorts, affects, impacts, and removes us from our human nature (this will be discussed throughout this section). It is with this in mind that the most powerful trance of trance-ference must be understood and dismantled so that the present can be experienced as the present, thus freeing our human nature and leading us to stabilize our Quantum nature. How do these distortions prevent us from experiencing present time?",
  "last_phrase": "In order to fully experience and embody our present moment, we must dismantle the powerful trance of trance-ference and recognize how our pre-verbal and pre-conscious cognitive interpretations distort our perception of reality. By liberating ourselves from the shackles of past experiences and structure patterns, we can stabilize our Quantum nature and truly appreciate the richness of the present."
