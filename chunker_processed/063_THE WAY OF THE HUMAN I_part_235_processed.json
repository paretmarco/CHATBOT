  "title": "How does Quantum Psychology explain the relationship between trauma and psychology, and how can reconnecting with the biological core help eliminate mystifying beliefs and thoughts?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the focus is on Quantum Psychology, which offers an alternative to the mystification of the world perpetuated by Reich's theory. It suggests that shock to the biological core is mirrored at a psychological level, and the uninterrupted flow of energy helps eliminate beliefs that create the illusion of separation. Quantum Psychology principle emphasizes that the Underlying Unity cannot be divided or separated, and awareness of the BIOLOGICAL CORE can lead to a natural body bliss. The False Core, when dismantled, allows for the realization of the biological function and a spontaneous connection to the world.",
  "content": "For Quantum Psychology, this is not a world of Gods and Goddesses, but of ONE INDIVISIBLE SUBSTANCE. 3) The breakages in the BIOLOGICAL CORE 145 The Way of the Human e Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness (Quantum Psychology would say breaks in awareness of your BIOLOGICAL CORE) create the illusion of a separate \"I\" and \"you\" which, when identified with, prevents realization of THAT ONE SUBSTANCE. QUANTUM PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLE: THAT ONE SUBSTANCE cannot be divided or separated. Rather, the images of separation and division (which are your psychology) are created by the body (nervous system) as a survival mechanism (i.e., a learning device so that it can \"never happen again\"). Simply stated being in the world is what the biological function and BIOLOGICAL CORE are about. This occurs naturally and spontaneously without psychological considerations when the core is realized and the False Core dismantled. When you lose awareness of your BIOLOGICAL CORE, the \"I\" gets fixated in the thinking or emotional dimension and feels disconnected from the body and from the world, and hence, the Underlying Unity. When you are aware of your BIOLOGICAL CORE, a natural body bliss is experienced.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology highlights the importance of realizing our BIOLOGICAL CORE, which can lead to a sense of oneness and Underlying Unity with the external world. The breaks in awareness of our BIOLOGICAL CORE create illusions of separation, causing conflicts within ourselves and draining our energy. Understanding this principle can aid in dismantling our False Core and experiencing natural body bliss."
