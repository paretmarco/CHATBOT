The previous tokens highlight a conversation between Paula and Wolinsky where they discuss different ideas about the \"I\". In the last 200 tokens, Paula shares that the experiencer and the experience are the same, and both disappear into nothingness. She further explains that \"I\" is not the body-mind, but rather a word referring to existence and separateness. The text encourages readers to rethink their understanding of personal identity and consider the idea that the self is not separate from experience.",
