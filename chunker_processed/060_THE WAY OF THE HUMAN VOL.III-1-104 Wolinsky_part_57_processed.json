In the last 200 tokens, she elaborates on how she tried hard to get her family to reflect back to her by being all kinds of things but failed. She even got married in high school, hoping for a reaction from her family. Wolinsky helps her re-enact her trance-ference with John to notice the similarities and differences between John and her family.",
