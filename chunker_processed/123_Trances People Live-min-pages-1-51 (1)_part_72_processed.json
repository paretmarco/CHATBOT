  "title": "How Can Trance States Impact Symptomatology in Hypnotherapy?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of trance states in hypnotherapy, and how they can both evoke resources and create symptomatology. The author discusses the importance of working with the trance state of the individual to deconstruct it, rather than inducing another kind of trance that may not be pivotal to the patient's symptoms. The author draws on the work of Milton Erickson, who promoted the idea of trance states as a natural occurrence in daily life. In the last 200 tokens, the author discusses Erickson's perspective on inducing satisfactory trance states in hypnotic work.",
  "content": "I saw that the person who brings his or her r Probl nit and symptoms to me is already in a trance state, and that it ise, very trance stale that is interrupting his or her experience oi ju' present moment, blocking unconscious potentials and rerourl and creating problems and symptoms . The therapeutic intervencres, then involves working with the trance state the person has ;Are: created (which de•kpnotizes him/her), rather than inducing facilitating another kind of trance that may or •may not be pivotal c;:o the patient's symptom structure. Certainly Erickson viewed trance states as natural occur ace • daily life and even coined the now well-used tam, \"commo-i; everyday trance.\" Erickson's conception of trance revolutionized the classical view of trance in hypnosis literature as being something that is solely induced or suggested by the operator. Yet Erickson nonetheless regarded trance as something to he induced via the presentation of various indirect (or direct) techniques. For example, in the opening paragraph of his 1952 art icle em it led \"Deep I 1 ypnosic and Its Induction,\" he writes (Erickson, 1952/1980): A primary problem in all hypnotic work is the induct ion of satisfactory trance states.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapeutic approach to hypnosis and trance states should involve working with the person's existing trance state rather than attempting to induce a new one. Erickson's approach revolutionized the classical view of trance and highlighted the importance of the presentation of indirect or direct techniques to induce and maintain a satisfactory level of trance. It is essential to recognize that inducing trance is one process and trance utilization is another, requiring skilled work and full regard for the individual's capacities to learn and respond."
