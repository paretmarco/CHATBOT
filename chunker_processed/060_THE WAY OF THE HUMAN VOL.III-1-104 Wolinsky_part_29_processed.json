  "title": "\"What is ESSENCE in Quantum Psychology and how can one turn themselves inside out to experience pure ESSENCE?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the concept of \"ESSENCE\", which is the pure awareness or being of a person, was explained. However, the permeation of external energies such as those from one's parents may hinder a person's ability to achieve their pure essence. The last part of this text presents Demonstration #6 in which Bill, a therapist from New York, goes through a process of turning his body inside out to experience his pure ESSENCE, while allowing energy to flow back to its original external source. This process helps reverse the flow of energy and allows individuals to return to their essential core, free from external influences.",
  "content": "To appreciate this, during conception there is an explosion and the \"you\"/ \"I\" is formed. Suddenly, the \"you\"/\"I\" \"you\" are, and pain begins. The desire to get the explosion of sudden enlightenment might be a repetitive age regression which occurs at a cellular level, a belief that if only we can get a hit (explosion ) from someone else (Mom/ Guru/God), we can go \"prior\" to the conception-explosion before pain and before we were, when there was NO-1. 'see The Tao of Chaos: Quantum Consciousness, Volume H (Wolinsky, 1994). 20 penetration of energy did not occur. In this process, we are reversing the flow. In this next demonstration, we are taking the space and we are going to turn it inside out, so you can experience pure ESSENCE. At the same time, we are allowing the energy to flow back to its original external source (mom/dad). DEMONSTRATION #6 FROM FALSE CORE To ESSENTIAL CORE Bill is a therapist from New York who has looked at his False Core for a year. He has a good handle on how it works.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the desire to return to a state of pure essence before pain and existence is a common human experience. However, true enlightenment comes from embracing and understanding our false core and working through it. By allowing the energy to flow back to its external source while turning our perspective inside out, we can experience true essence and healing."
