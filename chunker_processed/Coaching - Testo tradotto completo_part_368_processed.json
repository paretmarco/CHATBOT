  "title": "How can quantum methodologies be used for personal transformation and manifestation?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses quantum methodologies for problem-solving and personal transformation. The final 200 tokens describe two key techniques for taking action: focusing on the present moment to access a deeper understanding of the self, and consciously creating an improved reality through \"projection\". Rather than using the popular notion of the \"law of attraction\" to attract material goods, this technique emphasizes the importance of personal growth. The author suggests that a state of high psychological-physical activity, or energy exercises, can help individuals achieve their desired realities.",
  "content": "It is as if we gained access to that world which the ancient Greeks referred to as the world “of the universal beings”. This is an essential aspect for ensuring that what we want is not only valid, but also something which actually corresponds to our own selves. 2) “PROJECTION”. — After having defined what we want, let us now move to what we might more appropriately label the “creation”, within the physical reality, of a new reality. This phase has in our time been vulgarized by classifying it under what is named “law of attraction” and similar appellations. It represents that part of quantum methodologies which is best known among the public at large. Our goal must consist in bringing about an improvement of the human being, not just in attracting things which might possibly not even be needed by us. The best moment shall be represented by that time in the day when we experience the highest level of psychological-physical activity. Alternatively, in order to attain the required state, one might sometimes carry out energy-based exercises.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to improve ourselves and bring about tangible positive changes in our lives, it is essential to understand and access the world of universal beings, and to use the power of projection to create a new reality. By activating the plane of possibilities through mental representations and acts of volition, we can bring our desires into existence, always keeping in mind that our ultimate goal is to better ourselves, not just accumulate material possessions. With proper training and practice, we can become masters of projection, even in the midst of a crowded world."
