  "title": "What are the different types of trance-ference in relationships and how do they affect our perceptions of others?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discussed the earliest form of Trance-ference, which typically involves a person age-regressing and projecting parental figures onto others. These individuals often lose themselves and take on other people's identities. In this section, the author talks about Twinship Trance-ference, wherein individuals feel a sense of being twins with someone else. This feeling, however, stems from a projection of identical psychologies on the object, with any deviation threatening the relationship. The author also highlights the popularity of the concept of 'soulmates' in current literature, perpetuating the idea of finding a 'perfect alter ego.'",
  "content": "Psychologist Stephen Johnson says it this way, describing noted Self Psychologist Heinz Kohut's position on the twinship transference: 216 Special Section Kohut (1971) posits that the \"twinship\" transference is somewhat more evolved developmentally than the merger transference just outlined. Here, separateness is acknowledged but the individual assumes that he and the object (mother) have more or less identical psychologies with similar likes, dislikes, and philosophies, etc. The maintenance of this illusion is necessary for the maintenance of significant relationships. The discovery that another is not \"just like me\" even in some insignificant respect is enough to threaten the relationship. The twinship attachment, together with its fragility, is often seen in early teenage romances, where part of the function of the attachment is the discovery of self. The currently popular literature on \"soulmates\" seems to me, at times at least, to perpetuate this transferential relationship based upon the search for the perfect alter ego (Johnson, 1987). This twinship trance-ference negates separation. For that reason, the individual sees their partner as a twin, and goes into the spiritualized trance, calling the: relationship partner a soul mate.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the twinship transference and the mirror transference can offer valuable insights for maintaining healthy relationships, both with ourselves and with others. By acknowledging our separateness while still appreciating our similarities, we can avoid the twinship trance-ference and instead embrace a healthier and more realistic approach to relationships. Additionally, recognizing the importance of frustration and differentiation in our early experiences can help us become better mirrors for those around us, fostering growth and development in both ourselves and others."
