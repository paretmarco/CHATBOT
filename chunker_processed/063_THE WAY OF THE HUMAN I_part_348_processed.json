  "title": "What is Counter-Transference and how does it affect relationships and therapy?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author delves into the concept of counter-transference and its common occurrence in everyday life. They explain that counter-transference can be seen in relationships where one partner acts as a child and the other as a parent, wherein the age-regressed adult is in trance-ference and the other is unknowingly projecting their own childhood onto their partner. The author notes that even therapists and teachers can fall prey to trance-ference and counter-transference. To be truly free and compassionate for others, one must first recognize their bondage and work towards resolving it.",
  "content": "In the process of counter-trance-ference you identify more with the mommy/daddy or significant person from the past. This can be best illustrated in relationships. Notice how one partner might act like a child in the relationship while the other might act like the parent. The age-regressed adultxis in trance-ference, acting like a child, while the one acting like a parent is also age-regressed and in counter-tranceference, unknowingly seeing their partner as a child through the eyes of their parent, or you might say seeing their partner as their parents saw them as a child, and then projecting it on their partner. Quantum Psychology sees counter-trance-ference occurring when the person has an internalized other (momidad) and an internalized child. In this process, the person trance-fers the child onto another, and acts like a parent. It should be noted that therapists and teachers can go into trance-ference—making their client into dad or mom—or counter-trance-ference-----becoming a parent and making the client into a child. This usually occurs in forms of psychotherapy which teach therapists that they should be the \"good-enough\" morn or dad to their clients, guiding them through the developmental phases and giving them the \"corrective experience\" (to be discussed later).",
  "last_phrase": "It is important to recognize patterns of counter-tranceference in relationships and therapy to avoid reinforcing negative behaviors and age-regression. By understanding these dynamics, we can work towards breaking the cycle and promoting healthier relationships and interactions with others. Remember, awareness is the first step towards change."
