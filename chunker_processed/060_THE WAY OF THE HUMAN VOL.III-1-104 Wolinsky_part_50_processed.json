  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text, the conversation between Wolinsky and Barbara continues as they discuss the concept of a merger with Barbara's late mother. Barbara admits that while she can never merge with her mother in the same way again, there is still an essential connection she feels with her that has not gone. As the conversation progresses, they explore the various dishonesties that Barbara has told herself regarding her relationship with her mother, particularly in regards to her death. Finally, Wolinsky asks Barbara to imagine her mother and the big emptiness she is floating in. This conversation takes place within the context of the book \"The Way of the Human ■ Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" written by Wolinsky.",
  "content": "Yeah, I have a Essential Connection with mom and if I'm absolutely honest with myself, it's not gone because she died. Now, tell me one way you have been dishonest with yourself regarding this Essential Connection. Well, the stories are dishonest. All these mental constructs. The sense of grandiosity. The existence. Those are dishonest. It's also dishonest that I don't exist. Okay. Tell me another dishonesty regarding your mother. It's dishonest to say she's gone. What did you assume, decide or believe that got you to tell yourself that dishonesty? Well, if her body is gone, she's gone. Are you still believing that? No. The Way of the Human ■ Beyond Quantum PsychologyChapter 1 How does this concept called death seem to you now? I don't know how to talk about it. I mean she died. She died. Which means? I don't know what it means. Now, what I would like for you to do is to have an image of your mother, notice the size and shape of her, notice the BIG EMPTINESS she is floating in.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it's important to acknowledge and challenge the ways in which we may be dishonest with ourselves about our essential connections, like the one with our mother. By being honest and exploring our emotions, we can move towards acceptance and finding a sense of peace, even in the face of death. Connecting with our essence can help us tap into our inner strength and create a positive path forward."
