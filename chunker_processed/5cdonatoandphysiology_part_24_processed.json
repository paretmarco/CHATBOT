  "title": "\"How does Hypnosis Work? An Overview of Suggestion and its Effects on Subjects\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the power of suggestion and its ability to influence the behaviors and actions of individuals. The author describes how subjects can be easily manipulated through suggestion, adopting behaviors, and attitudes according to the will of the hypnotizer, almost instantaneously. The last part of the text focuses on the remarkable influence of the hypnotizer, as demonstrated by the reactions and behaviors of leading actors, actresses, and even the strongest man in Bordeaux, whom the author prevented from lifting a handkerchief. The power of suggestion is indeed powerful, as seen in the text, and Its influence on others can be both fascinating and alarming.",
  "content": "A little later I chose to suggest to this subject that a tiger pounced upon him. He immediately made a touching gesture of unspeakable terror. In Paris in 1881 Mounet-Sully the greatest French tragedian, having assisted in my séance, wrote me a long letter in which he said: \"If your experiments are not real, your subjects are comedians of genius worthy of being engaged at the Comédie Francaise ; for neither the great Talma nor the prodigious Frederic Lemaitre could equal them.\" Jules Claretie director of the Comedie Francaise, made a similar declaration in Le Temps; and Sara Bernhardt confessed herself incapable of assuming the attitudes and ecstatic expressions which I suggested to four lady friends of hers at a stance improvised by the celebrated painter Louise Abbema. A young subject wishing to lift a newspaper is made to believe that the paper weighs fifty pounds, and he exhausts himself in his effort. The imaginary weight drags him down and would make him fall did I not restore the lost equilibrium by pressing my hand on the opposite shoulder. At Bordeaux in 1887 in presence of all the press, I prevented Lawyer X (whose name I have forgotten), the most robust man in the city, from lifting a handkerchief.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the power of suggestion and hypnosis is undeniable, as demonstrated by the incredible reactions of those who have participated in these experiments. From creating feelings of terror to physical exertion and even shivering with cold, these impromptu scenes show the magnificent potential of the human mind under hypnotic influence."
