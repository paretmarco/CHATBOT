  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author cautioned traders against seeking excitement through trading and advised them to focus on making gains rather than experiencing emotions. The final section provides exercises for improving self-presence and reducing emotional overload while trading. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and releasing emotions as physical sensations and avoiding trading while in an emotional state to avoid errors. The exercises involve drawing attention to the body, breathing, and sensations to improve self-awareness and reduce emotional reactivity. By practicing these exercises, traders can improve their overall presence and ability to make rational decisions.",
  "content": "What we should in essence do is to learn emotions as they are, and then let go of them. Do not ever engage in trading if your realize that you are in a state which is conditioned by emotions; at that moment, in fact, you will only enjoy the use of one minor part of your mind, with the result that the chances of making errors get multiplied. By letting go of them at the moment in which we learn to feel them as \"sensations\", rather than as \"emotions\", we would be taking the first step towards releasing them. For example, a person who seeks out excitement in trading might draw attention to the issue of where and how he feels this sensation. Do not try and verbalize it. Do no more than feeling it. Feel the entire body, and let excitement flow away. When it comes to the emotions which are linked to fear, it might instead be of benefit to direct attention to our whole body, to feel the weight of the body, to feel our breathing. At that juncture, we would have recovered a point of reference.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, learning to let go of emotions and trade based on rationality can help avoid making errors in trading. By feeling emotions as mere sensations instead of engaging with them, traders can avoid being \"hypnotized\" by the market. Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the psychosomatic risks associated with sedentary trading and take steps to preserve personal health for a sustainable trading career."
