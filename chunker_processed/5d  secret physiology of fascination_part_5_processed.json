  "title": "What is the Mandelbaum effect and how does it affect our perception and safety?",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the focus shifts to the Mandelbaum Effect, a phenomenon that occurs in the brain rather than the eyes. The Effect causes spatial disorientation and is aggravated when visibility is poor. The text notes that the Effect is well-known in aviation, where dirty glasses can be dangerous. The text then delves into the eye's \"empty field\" or \"dark focus\" and how it affects vision when the subject moves farther away, leading to a change in the voice's location. When the subject moves closer, the accomodation in the eyes becomes insufficient for clear vision, and peripheral sensations become weaker. The section highlights how proximity can make a subject almost blind to the external world.",
  "content": "SPEAKING FROM OUTSIDE THE SUBJECT'S MICROCOSM - Movement and increasing of the Mandelbaum Effect The eye is lazy and resists the pull of a distant stimulus , preferring to rest at a relatively short focal distance as it does in the dark or when looking at the sky. As the operator will move farther he will move outside this point and his voice will seem to arrive from a different location ENTERING THE SUBJECT MICROCOSM This is done with a fast moving toward the subject. Directing the two eyes on a point demands an expreme convergence of the ocular axes and a strnous accomodation. The proximity of the point being to great, the accomodation, though contracted, is insufficient, in general to allow a clear vision. As for the surroundings objects their images form only the peripheral part of the retina, since the central part is focused. The peripherical sensations on the retina are weaker than the sensations at the centre. In these conditions the subject makes himself almost blind to the external world and the more we are near, the more the process is accentuated.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding the interplay between central and peripheral vision, fixation of attention, and the impact of circular movements on our eyes, we can become more aware of how our visual perceptions affect our actions and emotions. Whether speaking from outside or within a subjectâ€™s microcosm, these insights can expand our understanding of how we interact with the world around us."
