  "title": "\"How does the observer identity relate to the creation and dismantling of the inner child identity?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this last section, the author discusses the impact of the wounded inner child on an individual's present-time problems, limiting their scope and creating behavioral inevitabilities. The author aims to awaken the observer, dismantling past memories that create the perspective through which individuals perceive the world. The text references the impact of the observer's subjective experience in creating internal responses to external reality, from parents to teachers. The text ends by asking who is lost in this mistaken identity, created by the observer when individuals come to realize that the only way to be loved by parents is by giving up their needs and becoming a \"pleasing child.\"",
  "content": "In 1986, my first book, Trances People Live: Healing Ap- proaches in Quantum Psychology, talked of the impact of the observer (you) upon your subjective experience. In a nutshell, the observer (you), creates his/her internal subjective experience. You create a response to the environment, i.e., parents, teachers, hus- bands, wives, etc., and you are responsible for your internal, subjective experiences. To put this in Quantum Psychology terms, you, as the observer of external reality, participate in the creation of your internal, subjective responses and reactions. Now, let's take this in the realm of the \"wounded inner child identity.\" Let's say at a young age, you observed that the only way to get loved by Mom/Dad was to give up your own needs in favor of theirs and to please them. To handle this the observer creates an identity called \"pleasing child\" who gives up his/her own needs to gain love and approval. If the observer sees that this works, the observer continues to create this identity and places this identity of wounded pleasing child on automatic and then goes to sleep. Who is lost in this mistaken identity?",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, as the observer, you create your internal subjective experiences through your responses and reactions to the environment. In the case of the \"wounded inner child identity,\" it's important to recognize that you are the creator of this identity, and healing it is a false concept. The key is to understand that you are beyond this identity and take responsibility for your creation."
