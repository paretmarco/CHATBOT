  "title": "What is the \"good enough\" mother in Quantum Psychology and how does acknowledging ESSENCE and the underlying unity help avoid the trap of identity creation?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we learned about the concept of \"magical mommy\" and how some husbands transfer this role onto their wives. This final part delves into the idea of a \"good enough\" mother in Quantum Psychology. This rare individual is capable of mirroring ESSENCE and essential qualities to their child without fusing them with their personalities. By acknowledging their own ESSENCE and being, the mother can help weaken the child's identities, allowing for greater awareness of their underlying unity. This concept of mirror trance-ference is then spiritualized and transferred onto teachers and gurus, but unfortunately, many reinforce the same developmental patterns instead of ending them.",
  "content": "Moreover, the \"good enough\" mother, to avoid the trap of identity creation, must be able to do this in order for identities to be weakened and the awareness of ESSENCE strengthened. Unfortunately, this rarely occurs. The \"good enough\" mother in Quantum Psychology is, of course extremely rare. However, the idea would be to acknowledge ESSENCE and/or the underlying unity so that you and the infant \"know\" that connection while simultaneously allowing the child to differentiate at the external, thinking, emotional and biological levels. The mirror trance-ference becomes spiritualized (as will be discussed later) and is trance-ferred onto teachers and gurus. For example, spiritual seekers often call their guru the \"perfect mirror.\" This is the trance-Terence wherein an age-regressed adult is unknowingly relating to an internalized mom. It should be noted, however, that most gurus re-enforce these early pre-verbal developmental patterns. Some teachers and gurus I have spent time with allow their disciples to age-regress and imagine that they (the guru) are both 218 Special Section magical and omniscient. This reinforces these patterns rather than ending them, which is trance-ending.",
  "last_phrase": "In summary, acknowledging the essence and underlying unity while allowing a child to differentiate at various levels is crucial for their healthy development. Failing to do so may lead to the development of false grandiose identities, which separate individuals from others and the underlying quantum unity. Any feeling of being special or different from others must be recognized as a warning sign of identity operating."
