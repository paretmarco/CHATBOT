  "title": "What is the relationship between focal and ambient vision, and how can altering binocular function affect perception and balance?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, we learn about two types of vision: focal vision and ambient vision. Focal vision is used to consciously decipher task-oriented information, while peripheral vision is used subconsciously for spatial orientation. Under the section \"going beyond three-dimensional reality,\" we learn about binocular functions and how they can be altered by observing with only one eye. In the last part \"Awakening left side of vision,\" we discover hands as visual cues to increase attention, and how peripheral movements can affect the perception of body position. We explore the complex of visual areas linked to peripheral vision, which is important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery.",
  "content": "Each eye can have normal acuity (20/20 vision) but unless the eyes team, visual functions are impaired; <in observing very fast one eye after the other it seems that we alter binocular functions. AWAKENING LEFT SIDE OF VISION - WORKING ON THE LEFT EYE HANDS AS VISUAL CUE TO INCREASE ATTENTION USING PERIPHERAL MOVEMENTS TO AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF BODY POSITION Moving the hand in the peripheral field of vision can result in affecting the sense of balance. Different visual areas contribute to the processing of visual information coming from different parts of the visual field, and a complex of visual areas located along the banks of the inter hemispheric fissure (a deep groove that separates the two brain hemispheres) has been linked to peripheral vision. It has been suggested that these areas are important for fast reactions to visual stimuli in the periphery, and monitoring body position relative to gravity (Palmer SM, Rosa MG (2006). \"A distinct anatomical network of cortical areas for analysis of motion in far peripheral vision\". Eur J Neurosci 24 (8): 2389â€“405. doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05113.x.",
  "last_phrase": "To optimize visual functions, it is crucial to awaken the left side of vision and work on the left eye. Hands can serve as useful visual cues to increase attention, while peripheral movements can affect the perception of body position. By absorbing the spirit of the person in front of us, we can improve our diploplia, thus rendering our position uncertain. Remember, each eye may have normal acuity, but teaming them up is key."
