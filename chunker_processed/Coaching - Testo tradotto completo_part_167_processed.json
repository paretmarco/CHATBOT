These exercises are easy, effective and can be carried out anywhere with suitable objects or furniture.",
  "content": "The guiding point of these movements consists in waving the head in different directions, right and left, backward and forward, at the oscillation rhythm of one such movement every second. Even the back in general and the whole spine are essential for a proper development of energy. A first advice designed for everyday life is to focus on one’s own weight upon the ground, in order to identify a better vertical posture. There are, in addition, a number of useful exercises. The following one is an easy and effective illustration of them: Exercise 31 Position - Upright, feet drawn together, hands placed behind the back, with the fingers either joined or crossed by the sides. Execution – Lower the hands by letting them slide down your back. Go as low as you can. The hands must always stay in contact with one another. Thereafter, in order to consolidate the effect even further: Exercise 32 Position: Lie with your back against a pole, a tree, or, in the absence of either such object, against the edge of a partition, a wardrobe or any other kind of furniture, provided it is suitable to the implementation of the exercise.",

Try incorporating Exercise 31, Exercise 32, and Exercise 33 into your routine to start seeing the benefits today.
