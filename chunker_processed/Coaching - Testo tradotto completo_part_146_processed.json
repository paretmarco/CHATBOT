  "title": "\"How can consciousness exercises and avoiding anger enhance personal interactions and professional conduct?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the reader was introduced to an exercise that helps to acquire consciousness of different parts of the head. Now, the text focuses on how anger affects our productivity and decision-making. The author suggests avoiding acting on anger, as it is a bestial rather than human passion. A means to avoid anger outbursts is to treat everyone as our equal and respect their individuality. Ultimately, we ought to respect the quality intrinsic to man (his \"humanness\").",
  "content": "The choleric man, after all, makes a positive impact only the first time one comes across him, but that is soon followed by people laughing behind his back, with clear knowledge of the fact that the choleric person’s decisions are seldom final. A sure-proof means to avoid outbursts of anger as much as possible is to always be connected with our fellow human beings on the basis of calm and clearly defined relationships. The rules which are needed to achieve that objective can be subsumed under a single one: To uniformly treat every one, whether higher or lower, superior or subordinate, as our equal. We must respect the individuality of every person, and reflect over the truth that the world is beautiful precisely because it offers variety, and that it is quite likely that the person to whom you show aversion to harbours the same feeling towards you while having the undivided merit that he does not openly disclose it. In every person, even those people who are lower and children, you ought to respect the quality which is intrinsic to man (his ”humanness”) 43.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, treating every individual with respect and seeing them as equals can help us avoid outbursts of anger and develop positive relationships. It is also important to prioritize being a good human being over any profession, social position, religious or political faith. We should refrain from speaking ill of others and only express our opinions when solicited. By following these guidelines, we can create a more harmonious and peaceful world."
