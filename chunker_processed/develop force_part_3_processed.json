  "title": "What is the power of the gaze and how can it be trained for effective persuasion, charm, and leadership?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the power of the eye and how one can develop it to subjugate the energies possessed by the look to enchant and create an instantaneous hypnosis. The book is based on practical experience and the study of relevant literature. The text explains that the influence of man over another member of the species is no doubt the product of a multiplicity of causes but no one of those underlying causes is comparable to the one possessed by the look. The last 200 tokens describe an age-long uninterrupted sequence of witnesses' descriptions of how such force would materialize. It spans the medieval, Roman, and pre-Roman periods without exception and was incessantly transmitted in Italy more than in any other part of the world.",
  "content": "We have accordingly referred, in the course of our footnotes, to hundreds of varied historical, scientific and experiential sources. An other result, one more closely connected to everyday life, is to learn to use the power of the eye so as to develop your Presence, Status, Prestige, Charm, Self-caring, Charisma, and Leadership, up to the point that you literally become capable oh hypnotizing and magnetizing whichever person is watching you. Attractive charm, according to the ancient way of looking at things, is in fact “a far-reaching power that is exercised by a look over another look, one charged with such a force that whoever was subjected to it was unable to extricate his self from it, and was accordingly compelled to be fascinated by it”. We are able, in this context, to record an age-long uninterrupted sequence, running across centuries, of witnesses’ first-hand descriptions of how such force would materialize. This ongoing chain of consistent records spans the medieval, Roman and pre-Roman ages without exception. The most recondite aspects of such tradition appear to have been incessantly transmitted in Italy more than in any other part of the world, though such transmission took place within the most exclusive elites of special affiliates. This ancient mode of looking at things has in fact always been practiced on the basis of a direct transmission from master to disciple, without resorting to written texts, other than, at the most, some allusive documents carrying meanings which were concealed from non-adepts, and odd systems of arcane symbols.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, if you are looking to develop your presence, status, prestige, charm, self-caring, charisma, and leadership, and become capable of hypnotizing and magnetizing whoever is watching you, it is essential to develop awareness of the strength inherent in your look and actively employ it. Fascination is a powerful force that can transform both the one who inspires it and the one who is its recipient. To attain this power, it is necessary to discipline oneself through self-control, self-development, and self-improvement, as well as to undergo specific training. Through fascination, you can captivate people, reduce their subjective judgment, and sharpen your attention and other indispensable faculties in life."
