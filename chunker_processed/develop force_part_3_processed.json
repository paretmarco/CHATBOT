  "title": "How can you develop the power of your gaze to enchant and persuade others?",
  "first_phrase": "In the last part of this text, the author discusses the power of the eye and how it can be used to develop presence, status, prestige, charm, self-care, charisma, and leadership. The ability to subjugate the energies possessed by the look can lead to an instantaneous hypnosis in extreme circumstances, creating an attractive charm. The author also notes how the power of the eye has been practiced and transmitted from master to disciple throughout the ages, with Italy being the most influential. This comprehensive text draws from historical, scientific, and experiential sources to reveal the secrets correlated to the power of the eye.",
  "content": "We have accordingly referred, in the course of our footnotes, to hundreds of varied historical, scientific and experiential sources. An other result, one more closely connected to everyday life, is to learn to use the power of the eye so as to develop your Presence, Status, Prestige, Charm, Self-caring, Charisma, and Leadership, up to the point that you literally become capable oh hypnotizing and magnetizing whichever person is watching you. Attractive charm, according to the ancient way of looking at things, is in fact “a far-reaching power that is exercised by a look over another look, one charged with such a force that whoever was subjected to it was unable to extricate his self from it, and was accordingly compelled to be fascinated by it”. We are able, in this context, to record an age-long uninterrupted sequence, running across centuries, of witnesses’ first-hand descriptions of how such force would materialize. This ongoing chain of consistent records spans the medieval, Roman and pre-Roman ages without exception. The most recondite aspects of such tradition appear to have been incessantly transmitted in Italy more than in any other part of the world, though such transmission took place within the most exclusive elites of special affiliates. This ancient mode of looking at things has in fact always been practiced on the basis of a direct transmission from master to disciple, without resorting to written texts, other than, at the most, some allusive documents carrying meanings which were concealed from non-adepts, and odd systems of arcane symbols.",
  "last_phrase": "To sum up, the power of the gaze and fascination is a centuries-old tradition that can be harnessed to develop an individual's presence, status, prestige, charm, charisma, and leadership. To appropriate this power, it is necessary to develop awareness of the strength inherent in our look and actively employ it to draw close to quantum physics, which teaches us that \"the observer influences the observed\". Training the eye through specific exercises and acquiring a fixed and penetrating look can produce an irresistible effect in the field of persuasion. Ultimately, the ability to enchant can be directed towards positive and development-bound purposes."
