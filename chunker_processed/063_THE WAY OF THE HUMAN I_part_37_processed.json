  "title": "What is the Way of the Human and how does Quantum Psychology help in developing multi-dimensional awareness?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last part of the text, Stephen invites the reader to explore and dismantle belief systems that bind us. He references the 10th century Siva Sutras and how sound creates concepts that limit us. This is the way of the human, to join humanity in divine quantum splendor. Before this, Stephen explains the challenges of organizing the material in his three-volume set on Quantum Psychology and gives an overview of the basic principles in each volume. He recommends reading each volume from beginning to end for the ending surprise.",
  "content": "Naturally, this WHO AM I quest (as mentioned in Quantum Consciousness, Volume I) began as far back as \"I\" can remember. So there is the organization of the material to be dealt with. Then, the reader's previous knowledge of Quantum Psychology has to be called into question as a context for the trilogy. The trilogy attempts to stand on its own; but, it is highly recommended that Quantum Consciousness, Volume I and The Tao of Chaos, Quantum Consciousness, Volume II be considered as aids so that readers can appreciate and expand their context and understanding of this work. This chapter is an attempt to give an overview of some of the basic principles of Quantum Psychology and in which Volume of the Trilogy \"I\" will focus on what specific subject. Hopefully, this \"never-ending story\" does reach an end and conclusion in Volume III, Beyond Quantum Psychology. Readers might be tempted to flip to the end to see \"who done it,\" as if they were reading a detective novel but my suggestion is to go through each Volume from beginning to end because the ending is the surprise you always knew.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the \"WHO AM I\" quest in Quantum Consciousness is a complex journey that requires a deep understanding of the basic principles of Quantum Psychology. It is highly recommended that readers start from Volume I and work their way up through the trilogy. In Volume III, Beyond Quantum Psychology, readers will transcend multi-dimensional awareness and False Core-False Self, and explore the dismantling of awareness and Quantum Psychology itself - making this journey a non-linear process where the ending is the surprise you always knew."
