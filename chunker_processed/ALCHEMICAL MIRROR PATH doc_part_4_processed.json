  "title": "What is the Initiatory Path with Mirrors and how does it work?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the text introduced the concept of the \"Initiatory Path with Mirrors\" and described the different phases involved in this practice. In phase four, the text mentions the importance of increasing consciousness and joining the body of fire and air with the body of water, also known as the conjunction of the Lune and the Soleil. It also emphasizes staying \"present\" and developing a central principle of presence. In this final section, the author discusses the use of mirrors in different traditions such as the Tibetan, the Eastern, and the Western tradition. The text also highlights the teachings of the Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, a prominent representative of an Egyptian tradition, and the famous Cagliostro who used a jug of clear water to practice this ability.",
  "content": "Initiatory Path with Mirrors The fundamental exercises include the practice of viewing in a mirror. The use of this tool has both efficacity to increase the power of the eye as well this can also develop \"astral vision\" (in the Paracelsian sense) more effectively than any other tool. Most of the ancient fascinators practised this type of perception. A similar method is still practiced in the East, and this practice is called \"Melong\" and can also be practised on sheets of reflective metal. This practice is also conducted from antiquity in the Western countries. The mirror, in the Tibetan tradition is a polyvalent symbol, and also means clarity in the full sense of \"purity primordial \"(Tibetan ka dag) flow of consciousness. some of the traditions that rely on the use of a container full of water or jugs aim to develop of this ability. In the Western tradition I got in touch with one of my students, the Count Jean Pierre de Giudicelli, who was a prominent representative of a tradition of Egyptian origin. This tradition is linked to the presence to himself. I had a very long talk with him and I discussed the phenomenon. In the same tradition was the famous Cagliostro, that used a jug of clear water posted on a piece of furniture, and before it a child, on whose head the operator placed one hand and told him the questions to ask, to which replies were given in allegorical pictures.",
  "last_phrase": "The Initiatory Path with Mirrors provides a powerful tool for developing astral vision and energetic sensibility, enabling fascinators to operate in physical and energetic dimensions. The practice involves gazing into a mirror and observing oneself until reaching a deeper level of perception and understanding. By progressing through various stages of perception, practitioners can eventually achieve a state of cosmic consciousness beyond the ordinary self. The exercises encompass elements of fire, air, earth, and water, with the ultimate goal of reaching the higher self. With dedication and practice, one can overcome fear and emerge transformed, ready to explore new dimensions of consciousness."
