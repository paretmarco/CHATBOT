  "title": "What is the primal energy and how can separating it from the feeling of being alone lead to inner peace?",
  "first_phrase": "In Chapter VIII, Denise and Wolinsky discuss how people often fuse their False Core Conclusion with primal animal energy. They explore how this energy gets associated with negative labels like \"crazy,\" when it is simply energy and an archetypical struggle. By tracing this energy back to its source, they find a peacefulness and simplicity that was previously inaccessible. Through this exploration, they uncover how beliefs and assumptions can impact one's relationship with their energy.",
  "content": "Take the label off of both of them and allow them both to be energy and an archetypical struggle. Now notice the EMPTINESS they are floating in. See the energy and trace the energy back to the EMPTINESS. Where does it trace to? It's like fire itself. Like a log burning, fire, almost like lightning. Now trace it back to the EMPTINESS. How are you doing now? Just fine It's a different feeling of energy in my body. There is a peacefulness with it. I moved to if I feel that energy, I will alienate my mother and then I will die. I think that I stuffed upon that realization, I stuffed that energy. How are you doing now? Nothing. How does primal energy feel in your pelvis now? Its just kind of warm in there. It's just right there. I feel wonderful. I feel very peaceful. It's very simple. Where I feel the energy is up here in my shoulders, especially this one. Notice where, if anywhere, the hood and clamping down is right now.",
  "last_phrase": "Learn to detach from the labels and allow primal energy to flow freely through you. Trace it back to the emptiness and feel the peacefulness it brings. Don't let your fears of alienation and survival control your primal energy. Instead, visualize it as an archetypical struggle between opposing forces and learn to detach and unfuse them. This process can aid in developing multi-dimensional awareness, as demonstrated in the Tao of Chaos, Part #8."
