  "title": "What are the exercises to develop presence and concentration in oneself?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores various exercises for mental and physical discipline, all aimed at developing presence and concentration. The exercises are intended to train the mind to be fully present and attentive, rather than distracted by daily distractions. The author highlights various exercises such as clapping, walking, and observing movements, all designed to focus the mind and eliminate mental differences between \"background\" and \"foreground\". The text then moves on to the concept of \"presence\" and the reintegration of \"sub-sensitivities\" to increase sensitivity. Finally, the importance of being \"in things\" and not living life in one's thoughts is emphasized. The last 200 tokens offer specific exercises to bring the body and senses into the present moment.",
  "content": "Restore \"sub-sensorialties\" We call \"sub-sensorialty\" a series of outermost sensorial responses that normally we do not realize, and happen below the level of our consciousness (subliminal). To be increasingly present they must be reintegrated. Integrate sub-sensorialties is the key to increase oneself sensitivity. We have: At physical level sensations of magnetism At visual level the so-called \"auras\" At auditory level \"sub sounds\" The following exercises can help integrate these sub-sensorialties BODY Magnetic sensations Move a finger towards the palm of your hand. Even without touching, the palm will feel a tingling sensation; move away the finger, and notice how there may be a remaining feeling. After this preliminary exercise, work out every day to bring energy to your \"hara\" (your navel) through the “magnetic steps”. VIEW The Aura Exercise 22 –focus on the mirror In front of a mirror performs the following steps: With an uninterrupted light not too strong, breathe slowly and look at your face in a mirror. It is ideal to do this when you are a little tired, but not too much. Keep yourself in a relaxed status and focus on the center point, an eye or your forehead. In a short time, you will feel heat in the back of the neck. At this point, continue to focus. This heat is your energy. Now you can imagine to be opening a door.",
  "last_phrase": "By integrating sub-sensorialties, we can increase our sensitivity and awaken our magnetic potential. Through the exercises provided, such as the magnetic steps, viewing one's aura, and developing body flexibility, we can overcome polarities and build our own reality. By detaching ourselves from primary senses and using willpower, we can awaken the serpent power and move towards a higher sense of unity. These exercises require practice and a focused mind, but with perseverance, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us."
