  "title": "What are the exercises to develop presence and increase sensitivity?",
  "first_phrase": "The text discusses various exercises to enhance concentration and cultivate a state of presence. It begins with a description of a curve-following exercise that improves inter-hemispheric coordination and attention. The last part (200 tokens) discusses exercises such as the needle, hearing, clapping, steps, and necklace, which help individuals develop their concentration and awareness. The text describes other exercises, including the funnel, light in motion, and ways to integrate sub-sensorialties, such as magnetic sensations, auras, and sub-sounds. The goal is to develop the ability to be present and the \"knowing that we are there.\" The text cites Gurdjieff, ancient alchemists, Taoists, yogis, and esoteric traditions emphasizing the importance of presence to strengthen the fascinative force.",
  "content": "Restore \"sub-sensorialties\" We call \"sub-sensorialty\" a series of outermost sensorial responses that normally we do not realize, and happen below the level of our consciousness (subliminal). To be increasingly present they must be reintegrated. Integrate sub-sensorialties is the key to increase oneself sensitivity. We have: At physical level sensations of magnetism At visual level the so-called \"auras\" At auditory level \"sub sounds\" The following exercises can help integrate these sub-sensorialties BODY Magnetic sensations Move a finger towards the palm of your hand. Even without touching, the palm will feel a tingling sensation; move away the finger, and notice how there may be a remaining feeling. After this preliminary exercise, work out every day to bring energy to your \"hara\" (your navel) through the “magnetic steps”. VIEW The Aura Exercise 22 –focus on the mirror In front of a mirror performs the following steps: With an uninterrupted light not too strong, breathe slowly and look at your face in a mirror. It is ideal to do this when you are a little tired, but not too much. Keep yourself in a relaxed status and focus on the center point, an eye or your forehead. In a short time, you will feel heat in the back of the neck. At this point, continue to focus. This heat is your energy. Now you can imagine to be opening a door.",
  "last_phrase": "Integrating sub-sensorialties through exercises such as those mentioned can increase your sensitivity and awareness of physical sensations, visual cues, and auditory sounds that you may not have been aware of before. By awakening the power of magnetism within you, learning to see and feel auras, and building flexibility in your body, you can develop a stronger sense of unity within yourself. Through the hot water-cold water exercise, you can overcome polarities and learn to live in a reality built from within. Remember, your path to greater awareness starts with yourself."
