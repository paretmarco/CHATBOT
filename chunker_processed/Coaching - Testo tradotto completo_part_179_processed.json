  "title": "\"What is the innate talent of achievers and how can we find our life direction?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of achievers and how they achieve success through self-direction and understanding of their innate abilities. Seneca's quote sets the stage for the idea that knowing where to head is crucial. The \"state of flux\" theory posits that individuals who attain higher levels of success are self-directing and align their objectives with their inward being. Understanding one's innate talent for existential choices and embracing coincidences as paths tailored for us, enables us to find outward expressions of self. Carl Jung's view that the psyche is driven by goals, not just causality, supports the idea that life's possibilities are openings rather than restrictions. Ultimately, achieving success in life is about playing with it, with perception and understanding being key.",
  "content": "These inborn gifts to choose a direction in life finds expression in the realms of thoughts, facts and coincidences that seem to indicate a specific path which is, at the same time, a path that is intrinsically tailor-made for us and one that corresponds to our distinguishing peculiarities. “Causality is no more than a principle, and psychology cannot be exhausted merely by having recourse to causal methods, due to the fact that the spirit (the psyche) lives to an equal extent out of goals it aims for” (Carl Gustav Jung) When they are truthful, these are never constrictions, but rather openings. We must understand that they represent possibilities which the Universe grants us in order for us to find an outward outlet of self-expression. We must avoid viewing them as obligations, as we should rather deem them possible directions we can take for the sake of living out life. The truth is that we “play” with life, in the sense that life is always complete in itself, whichever way one spends it. The higher your presence and perception, the better will be your understanding of these originating impulses.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, we must approach the inborn gifts of directional impulse as possibilities to express ourselves and not as obligations. By being mindful and present, we can sense the direction in which the Universe is guiding us, and by following it with trust, we can achieve a fulfilling life. As Carl Jung said, causality is only a principle, and our psychology cannot be limited to causal methods. So let us embrace the possibilities that life offers and play the game of life fully."
