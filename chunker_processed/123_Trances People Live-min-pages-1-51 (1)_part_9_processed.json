  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the role of consciousness in the Quantum universe and how it affects our perception of reality, as well as the concept of Deep Trance Phenomena. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares a personal breakthrough moment that led to the realization that all symptoms presented by clients had associated Deep Trance Phenomena. These phenomena act as glue to hold the symptomatology together and without them, the symptom cannot repeat itself.
