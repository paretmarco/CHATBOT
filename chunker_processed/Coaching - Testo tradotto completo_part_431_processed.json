  "title": "\"How can we resolve conflicts by being present and using role-playing techniques?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The text delves into the roots of conflicts and provides two possible ways to resolve them: either by accommodating the interlocutor's thoughts or by being present and shifting attention to a pre-verbal plane. The last 200 tokens discuss the concept of role models and how people distort reality, leading to negative hallucination. The text suggests adopting hypnotic identities consciously to influence others and pilot change. It concludes with a mention of trances detached from roles.",
  "content": "As for the magnetic person, he operates outside this scheme of things altogether. He has only a few moments of restless agitation. His look is attentive while being simultaneously inquisitive. What ensues from it is the fact that the interlocutor is incapacitated from determining which stance he ought to adopt, and ends up being a subliminal follower of whatever suggestion has been put forward to him. If, contrary to the other category of persons, we are very present, we might even influence other people by taking on roles which conform to the relevant type of activated regressions. This recourse to \"role-playing\", in fact, greatly facilitates the use of the whole spectrum of these elements. Roles represent hypnotic identities which are normally connected to regressive phenomena. If we adopt a certain role consciously, the other person usually adopts the corresponding one unconsciously. A practical way of proceeding along this path might consist in posing a few questions which allow your competence to shine out in full, whereupon you will cast yourselves into the role of a counsellor and be able to pilot the change your interlocutor should undergo. The “dreamer” Many trances might even be detached from the roles that are played.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding the power of role-playing and utilizing the hypnotic identities associated with it can greatly influence and guide the change of an interlocutor. By identifying their regression type and leading them towards their desired future, we can utilize their expectation and help plan things in an efficient manner while being aware of the magnetic person's unconventional behavior."
