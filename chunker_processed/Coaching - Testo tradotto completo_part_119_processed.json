  "first_phrase": "In the final part of the text, the author delves into the practical implications of their exercises for mental focus and concentration. They introduce the concept of \"being present\" and how it relates to our connection to ourselves and reality. The author poses questions about how often we fail to be truly present and how many useless thoughts clutter our minds. They assert that consciousness is the key to \"riding one's destiny\". By removing useless thoughts, we can achieve self-mastery and power over different situations. This path of re-integration involves acquiring a higher degree of self-awareness and connection to reality.",
  "content": "How many times we are in fact unable to carry out what we would like to do? How much are we really present to our own selves in the course of a single day? How many times is our mind burrowed by thoughts or ideas which are neither desired nor useful? On how many occasions do we fail to be truly our own selves? In actual fact, human freedom (the so-called free will) does exist, and yet is extremely circumscribed. Usually, man is in essence ir-responsible until and unless he becomes conscious of what he does. The key to every thing, to be able to \"ride one’s destiny”, lies in being conscious. That entails having consciousness of one’s own being. A first essential step along this path is learning to remove useless thoughts, as we explained before. In taking such a first step, we will achieve a lot, since we will shelve aside part of what encumbers us. Once we have removed thoughts, in fact, all that is then left is our own selves. Wanting to travel on this path of re-integration carries the meaning of naturally acquiring a higher degree of self-mastery and power over the different situations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, becoming conscious of our being is a pivotal step towards achieving self-mastery and power over different situations. To \"ride one's destiny,\" one must learn to remove useless thoughts and create a state within themselves that enables them to choose, decide, and act with specific purposes in mind. By pronouncing the words \"I am\" and sensing the sensation that engenders in our body, we can take the first essential steps towards reaching this point of self-awareness and achieving our goals."
