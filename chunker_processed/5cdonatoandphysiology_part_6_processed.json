  "title": "What led to the decline of Animal Magnetism in the 1800s and how was it revived by Donato in 1873?",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the concept of Animal Magnetism and how it was perceived by the medical community was discussed. Animal Magnetism faced strong criticism from scientific societies and was considered a fraud. However, a few experts continued to practice and propagate it, which inspired renowned doctors like Charcot, Bernheim, and Braid to write remarkable works. In the last 200 tokens, the text explains how the secrets surrounding the technique made it difficult to disseminate. The text also mentions the names of the individuals who continued to practice Animal Magnetism, including Du Potet and Lafontaine.",
  "content": "Baron du Potet for example, that begun to practice magnetism in the same year in which Mesmer died (1815), staid in France as a strong magnetist and directed an important journal of magnetism, and it is interesting that in 1826 he got a very favorable report from the Academy of Medicine that didn't get the attention it deserved. In any case in the middle years of 1800 magnetism was on its low. Only a few experts were left in Europe and without the exhibitions from town to town and from country to country, of a few professors of the art like Du Potet, Lafontaine, and on a less scientific side Regazzoni, Hansen and some others, mesmerism would have slept in the obscurity in which the Academy of Medicine had buried it. Without these energetic propagandists, without their example and their lessons, neither Doctor Charcot, Doctor Bernheim, Doctor Braid (inspired by Lafontaine), Doctor Liebeault, nor Doctor Heidenhain (inspired by Hansen), would ever have written their remarkable works; and the question might have remained in oblivion. This state of things is explained by the secrets surrounding the technique that rendered difficult its diffusion.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the propagation of animal magnetism faced challenges due to the secrecy surrounding its techniques, resulting in ineffective methods, and only a few experts were left in Europe. However, the efforts of energetic propagandists such as Du Potet, Lafontaine, Regazzoni, Hansen, and others revived the interest in animal magnetism. Donato later contributed significantly to changing old conceptions and reigniting attention throughout Europe."
