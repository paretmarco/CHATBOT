  "title": "\"Is it possible to maximize your time and achieve success through a simple method?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final section of this text, the author introduces the method discussed in the book that aims to enhance one's life to the fullest extent possible. The author mentions that the element of time is the primary component of an individual's success and happiness, which can be controlled by being 'present to our own selves.' By enacting such self-presencing, one can gain greater control over their life, relationships and improve their financial situation. The method explained in the book answers various questions like how to reduce effort, increase the percentage of likelihood of success, and ultimately turn the context into a pleasant one.",
  "content": "The method we are going to set out in this book, therefore, answers all these various questions: Is it possible to operate in the field of free activity, the field of individual action, in such a way as to carry out a more effective undertaking within the same time of span (say, for instance, one day), and thus secure for ourselves “more time”, so to speak? Is it possible, amid the tumult of everyday life, to find a simple method that enables us not to lose sight of our own selves? Is it possible to daily reduce the role which is played in our existence by the type of chance we fear, and simultaneously increase the percentage of likelihood and materialization of the chance we hope for? Is it possible to reduce the effort that is needed to carry out a particular deed or series of deeds, which we now come to view as “tiresome”? Is it even possible to reach the stage of turning the context into a “pleasant” one?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this book offers practical methods to operate in the field of free activity and find a simple way to not lose sight of oneself amid the challenges of everyday life. Moreover, it helps to reduce the role of chance and tiresome effort, turning every situation into a pleasant one, and exploiting each of them to maximize the benefit or minimize harm. Ultimately, these methods aim to achieve success in all endeavors."
