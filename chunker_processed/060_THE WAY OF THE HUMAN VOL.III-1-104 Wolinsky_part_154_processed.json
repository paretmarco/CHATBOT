  "title": "\"What is Beyond Korzybski and the Void of Undifferentiated Consciousness?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final 200 tokens of this text titled \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" the author discusses an exercise called \"Beyond Korzybski\" that helps individuals go beyond the limitations of their nervous system to access the void of undifferentiated consciousness. The author expands on Korzybski's understanding that the nervous system organizes experience, but highlights that the nervous system is an abstraction of the quantum world. The exercise urges individuals to look at their experience and label any identity as \"I,\" while noticing the observer and labeling it as \"not I.\" This exercise helps individuals become aware of the big emptiness and the witness beyond their limited point of view.",
  "content": "What he did not understand, however, was that the nervous system is also condensed EMPTINESS and, hence, an abstraction of the Quantum world rather than the other way around. Metaphorically and anthropomorphically speaking, the Quantum world is an ocean and the nervous system a wave. The wave (nervous system) is only aware of the ocean from its own limited point of view. But Korzybski did not appreciate that the nervous system was a by-product of the condensed quantum EMPTINESS or the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. Because of this lack of understanding he could only claim in 1933 that EMPTINESS was incorrect and should be called Fullness or phelum. His misunderstanding was partly the result of the lack of scientific data at that time. Actually it is neither EMPTINESS or FULLNESSâ€”because in order to call it that there would have to be an \"I\" (Nervous System) there to say it was so. Furthermore, he could not know, for example, what the eminent physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking would say in A Brief History of Time that \"in the beginning there was NOTHINGNESS.\" NOT-I- EXERCISE #3 Step I: Step II: Look at your experience.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our understanding of consciousness and its relationship with the Quantum world is still evolving. However, it is vital to comprehend that the nervous system is an abstraction of the Quantum world, and consciousness is a result of the VOID OF UNDIFFERENTIATED CONSCIOUSNESS. By acknowledging this relationship, we can dive deeper into the vast NOTHINGNESS of pure awareness and explore the tendencies of the void."
