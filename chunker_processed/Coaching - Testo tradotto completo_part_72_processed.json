  "first_phrase": "In the previous part, the author emphasizes the importance of originality and escaping the trap of habitual thinking. Now, he explores the idea of finding the new and unprecedented in every aspect of our lives. Through curiosity, we can interact more with our environment and multiply our opportunities. The author encourages readers to regularly ask themselves about the number of new people they've met and urges them to give preference to what is novel.",
  "content": "If we head for a restaurant, let us try a new dish we had never tasted before, and so on and so forth, constantly giving preference to what is novel. Searching for the new As we have already indicated, inside us there is a force with a propensity for repetition. Manâ€™s true growth, however, lies in coming to know and discovering the new in every moment and in every thing. We should struggle, in every moment of our life, to give pride of place to what is new and unprecedented over anything which has already been seen or tested before. Experiential variety is the true secret for prolonging life 17. Whoever stops developing closes himself up and diminishes his interaction with the environment. Be curious! Every successful person is curious. By multiplying the instances of interchange with the surrounding environment, the successful man will multiply his opportunities as well, because he is part and parcel of such environment. If we think in the same manner all the time, we shall invariably obtain the same things time and again, and nothing will ever change in our lives. You ought to regularly ask yourselves: How many new people I have come to know this week?",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, embracing novelty and maintaining a curious attitude towards life is the key to personal growth and success. By striving for experiential variety, setting goals, and eliminating mentally superfluous activities, one can continually improve and extend their time on earth. So go out and explore, try new things, and always be open to discovering the undiscovered."
