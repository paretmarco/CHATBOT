  "title": "What is Multi-Dimensional Awareness and How Does it Relate to Human Nature and Quantum Psychology?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the importance of acknowledging our full human nature to stabilize our awareness of the underlying unity of our Quantum Nature. In the last part, the author emphasizes that the Nervous System is a condensation of that ONE SUBSTANCE and can only imagine it can influence the underlying unity. The author also notes that unprocessed psychological material can pull our attention out of the awareness of WHO WE ARE. The text references various paths of knowledge and traditions that suggest our human nature can get in the way of experiencing our Quantum Nature.",
  "content": "To illustrate, unprocessed psychological material can be likened to undigested food. Undigested food sits in our intestines making us sick and pullling our attention and awareness. In the same say, unprocessed or undigested psychological material sometimes can pull our attention out of the awareness of WHO WE ARE. 2 Chapter 1 edge suggest that it is our human nature which gets in the way of discovering and experiencing the underlying unity of our Quantum Nature. In Yoga-land, for example, emotions such as anger, jealousy, greed, lust, and hatred are referred to as the five enemies. In the Christian tradition oftentimes those and others like envy, pride, sloth, gluttony, avarice, vanity, lust, etc., are considered vices which should be converted into virtues. According to Buddha, all pain arises because of desire. The dilemma seems to be that it is human nature to desire. In fact, more pain is caused by resistance to desiring. After all, what is desire but an impulse that comes as the EMPTINESS or underlying unity pulsates and contracts to become something.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, understanding and processing our psychological material is vital for our overall well-being, and while it may seem counterintuitive, our emotional and psychological states are not something to be rid of, but rather embraced as part of our human experience. By embracing and accepting our emotions, we can tap into our essence, which is characterized by qualities such as compassion and unconditional love, and ultimately, move closer to discovering and experiencing the underlying unity of our Quantum Nature."
