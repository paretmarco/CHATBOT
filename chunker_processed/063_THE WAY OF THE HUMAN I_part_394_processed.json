  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author delves into the difference between premature detachment and true detachment, which is called Witnessing. They emphasize that mis-perceived betrayal is a major factor in creating identities, and these identities contain spiritual trances that are difficult to root out because they are never questioned. The author quotes Bollas (1987) and highlights the individualâ€™s relationship with themselves as an object to be observed. They also mention Quantum Psychology's statements on how transference plays out with oneself, others, and the observer.",
  "content": "Identities contain trances. Some of the deepest trances are spiritual trances. These spiritual trances are difficult to root out for three major reasons: 1) they are very early and pre-verbal; 2) they are never questioned; and 3) spiritual systems and teachers are often organized around them and reinforce and validate them. 258 Special Section CONCLUSION Quantum Psychology has several statements regarding how this trance of transference is unfortunately \"acted out,\" both with yourself, with others, and the observer: 1. Do unto yourself that which was done unto you. 2. Do unto others that which was done unto you. 3. How you observe \"yourself' is how Mom and Dad observed you Bollas (1987) also suggests that as you were treated as a child, so you will treat yourself, or as you were viewed by morn and dad as a child so shall you view yourself. One idiom of representation is the person's relation to the self as an object to be observed, and object relationships where the individual may objectify, imagine, analyze, and manage the self through identification with primary others who have been involved in that very task (p. 41). . . .",
  "last_phrase": "To break free from spiritual trances, it's important to understand how past experiences and parental observations influence our self-perception. Quantum Psychology sheds light on the ways we internalize these identities and how they shape our behavior. By recognizing and challenging harmful patterns, we can begin to treat ourselves with kindness and compassion. Remember to be patient and gentle with yourself on this journey towards healing."
