  "title": "How Can Wealth and Intellectual Activity Contribute to a More Enjoyable Life?",
  "first_phrase": "In this thought-provoking text, the author examines the relationship between material wealth and happiness, arguing that while it is true that wealth enables one to fully enjoy life's pleasures, it is false to assume that there is a fixed threshold beyond which one can only become happier. The author also reflects on the role of disinterested intellectual activity in enriching one's spirit and producing greater wealth and better relationships. In this last part, the author discusses the need for a profitable plan of intellectual work, examining our intellectual tendencies and shortcomings, and the importance of fulfilling our preferred intellectual activity alongside our professional activity.",
  "content": "Among other things, this self-enrichment might in turn lead us to useful ideas which will produce greater wealth for our finances as well as for our relationships, due to the correspondence which exists between several interests and different ways of establishing communication with other people. As the issue is one relating to the need of establishing a profitable plan of intellectual work, it will be first of all convenient to carry out a meticulous examination of our intellectual tendencies as well as our shortcomings. More often than not, our shortcomings are dependent on our intellectual inclinations, inasmuch as it is such subjective tendencies which lure us into delving more deeply into certain fields of knowledge at the expense of others which are either neglected or totally ignored! After we have fulfilled our general cultural needs, we will take care to satisfy our preferred intellectual activity, whenever this activity is not the same as our professional activity. This elective activity might represent our refugium, our sanctuary, and the source of our purest satisfactions.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to achieve intellectual fulfillment and balance in our lives, we must prioritize our preferred intellectual activities alongside our professional ones. By investing time in self-enrichment through meticulous examination of our tendencies and avoiding mindless consumption of media, we can cultivate useful ideas that benefit our financial and personal relationships. Let's strive for a proportionally inverse path between our professional and elective activities, ultimately leading us to a more fulfilling life."
