  "title": "What is the enneagram and how can it be used for communication and personal/professional growth?",
  "first_phrase": "In this piece on the Enneagram, we explore how it can be used as a communication tool in both personal and professional settings. By observing our interlocutors' behaviors and identifying their Enneagram types, we can understand the reasons behind their actions and build rapport without risking conflict. This understanding is crucial for those in a therapeutic or business setting to communicate effectively and predict behavior. The Nine Enneagram Types are described in-depth, and under Type 8, we learn about \"The Challenger,\" whose key motivation is to seek knowledge and power while being fiercely competitive.",
  "content": "ENNEAGRAM: A PROFESSIONAL & PERSONAL TOOL On a personal level it gives us the possibility of extending self-knowledge and favoring the development of a balanced personality. It helps us to communicate better with the people that are important in our lives, in work, in relationshipsâ€¦ etc. On a professional level, the enneagram is useful to therapists, consultants and also to those in a business field, like managers, because it completes knowledge, allowing you to understand the people with whom you have a relationship in a quicker and deeper way and to react while keeping in mind what is most important. For example, if you are a business man and you use the enneagram correctly, you can understand more about the abilities of your team members, instilling in them a team spirit which is fundamental to achieve success. In all cases, the enneagram is more than a simple method to understand ourselves and others, it is open to the past and the future at the same time. That is why when we talk about the enneagram we can immediately associate it as a: TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING SELF; TOOL FOR PREDICTING; TOOL FOR DEVELOPMENT; and TOOL FOR COMMUNICATING. Even if we have divided psychological typology into nine categories, it is important to point out that we have all of them present in us, although we have a preference for certain types, or we use the type that we need at each situation. Psychiatric pathologies are psychological enneagram types taken to the extreme or can be at rest, hence, empty.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the enneagram is a powerful tool for both personal and professional development. It allows us to understand ourselves and others in a deeper and faster way, to communicate effectively, and to build stronger relationships. Hypnosis, on the other hand, is a natural state of mind that can be induced to achieve profound relaxation and access the subconscious mind to resolve everyday disturbances, increase our ability, and follow specific objectives. Learning self-hypnosis can be a crucial step towards unlocking our potential and achieving greater success in life. With the right techniques and objectives, both the enneagram and hypnosis can be valuable instruments for personal growth and transformation."
