  "content": "Most of us – it ought to be repeated – either desire too little or desire something so feebly that no conscious effort arises out of such enervated desire. When that is the case, as magnets we are too weak for us to attract to our persons what we want for ourselves. We must therefore learn how to turn ourselves into strong attracting magnets. As a step in that direction, we should think of time as being other than a convention. What exists is simply the universe around us, and we can draw a reply from it. Such vision has no room for an existent called time. Only the present moment exists 75. The methods which are set out here below always presuppose the fact that you have already succeeded in identifying a centre within your own selves, and that you deem what you are aiming at to be truly beneficial, as these are essential elements for achieving any thing in the universe. Method 1 – Light It is the simplest method of them all. 1. Verbalize your goal. 2. Thereafter, fix your look on a light 76 and repeat such verbalization. 3.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to turn ourselves into strong magnets that can attract what we desire, we need to go beyond convention and embrace the universe around us. To achieve this, one practical step is to adopt Method 1: Light, where we verbalize our goal, fix our gaze on a light, and visualize our goal appearing in the luminous trace. With persistence and practice, we can become powerful attractors of what we truly want in life."
