  "title": "\"What is the Virgilio Technique in Hypnotism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this text describes an experiment that was successful in hypnosis. The author explains how he used various techniques, including distracting the subject's attention and changing his expression to achieve the desired state. The author invokes the name of Virgilio, a hypnosis expert who had suggested some of the techniques used in the experiment. The author goes on to describe how he imitated Virgilio's mannerisms, and how he eventually succeeded in putting the subject in a hypnotic state. The text ends with the author concluding that the experiment was a complete success.",
  "content": "7) Il soggetto mi sembrava molto \"immobile\" ed allora ho fatto 2 PASSI INDIETRO e poi ho provato a dare il comando MANI LEGATE che ha funzionato al 100% (ha anche effetto per l'ipnotista che si sente meglio) 8) Schiaffetto mentre ancora armeggiava con le mani E NON RIUSCIVA ANCORA. 9) Fine esperimento che io considererei RIUSCITO ALLA PERFEZIONE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the experiment proved to be a success as the subject was rendered immobile by the effective use of the \"mani legate\" command. Taking a step back allowed for a clearer understanding of the subject's state, and a swift slap on the hands was enough to solidify the effect. Overall, this serves as a useful technique for hypnosis and highlights the importance of precision and observation in conducting such experiments."
