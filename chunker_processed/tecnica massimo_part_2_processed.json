  "title": "\"What are the Steps to Hypnotize Someone without Touching Them According to Virgilio?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, the author talks about the technique of distracting someone by making a gesture in front of their face, and how it often works. In the last 200 tokens, the author shares an experiment they conducted where they used the technique on someone and noticed a change in their facial expression. They then mimicked the expression and the person was surprised. The author proceeded to take some short breaths with their mouth open as instructed by someone named Virgilio and tried a command to make the subject's hands feel tied, which worked 100%. The experiment is considered a success by the author.",
  "content": "7) Il soggetto mi sembrava molto \"immobile\" ed allora ho fatto 2 PASSI INDIETRO e poi ho provato a dare il comando MANI LEGATE che ha funzionato al 100% (ha anche effetto per l'ipnotista che si sente meglio) 8) Schiaffetto mentre ancora armeggiava con le mani E NON RIUSCIVA ANCORA. 9) Fine esperimento che io considererei RIUSCITO ALLA PERFEZIONE.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the experiment was successful as the command to tie hands worked 100% effectively after taking two steps back to address the immobility of the subject. The added impact of the hypnotist feeling better also suggests a positive outcome. Finally, administering a light slap to the subject while they were still attempting to untie themselves demonstrated the success of the experiment. With these steps, one can be confident in replicating this experiment in the future and achieving similar results."
