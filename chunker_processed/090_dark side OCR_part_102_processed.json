  "title": "\"What is the Connection between Trance, Dis-Connection, and Alcoholism?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous text, the author discusses the concept of disconnection and its relation to alcoholism as a coping mechanism. The author highlights how the inner child's fusion with an alcoholic parent can lead to excessive drinking as a result of stress. In the last 200 tokens, the author explores the idea that a problem can only exist when a person is in a trance and that transcending the trance means the end of the problem. Furthermore, the author offers a clue to identify disconnection and suggests using intentional trance to address it in therapy.",
  "content": "Whenever he drank, he had to take out the picture, put it on the table and \"toast\" Dad saying, \"Thank you, Dad, for teaching me how to handle stress.\" This exaggerated the inner child's fusion. A symptom can only be a problem if there is some kind of trance. When a person is \"being here now,\" there is no trance. Actually, we can say no problem can exist without a trance. This can be seen as the real meaning of the word transcending. In other words, trance ending a problem means trance-ending, when a trance ends and there is no problem you are in no-trance. This is the end of trance, hence, trance-ending. I know people that look directly at me but are not with me at all. There is a film over their eyes. Watch their eyes and notice if a film comes over them. Recognize this is a clue your partner is dis- connecting. This film over his eyes indicates he is watching an old film or movie and not being here now. In therapy, I might suggest something to intentionally create the trance you are having.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, recognizing the presence of a trance can be a powerful tool in identifying and addressing personal problems. By intentionally creating the trance, one can begin to unravel its grip on their life, and come back to the present moment. Learning to recognize the signals of a trance, such as holding one's breath or tightening muscles, can aid in staying present and avoiding its hold. By doing so, we can prevent trances from acting like glue for problems and start living a more fulfilling life."
