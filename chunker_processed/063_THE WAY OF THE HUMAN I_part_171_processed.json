  "title": "How can multi-dimensional awareness be developed through dialogue with the aspect and realization of emptiness?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous sections, we discussed the importance of the thinking dimension and how we can discard thoughts that limit our perception of reality. In Step III, we explore dialogue with the aspect and ask what it's resisting in knowing about itself. In Step V, allowing the aspect to experience what it's resisting can help us see the emptiness surrounding it. The following steps explore how to stay in the nonverbal I AM level beyond the observer-observed dyad. The text concludes with a discussion on the fusion of the void and uncooked narcissism of the thinking and emotional dimension.",
  "content": "For this reason, it becomes important to notice how we interpret present time reality through the vehicle of this dimension. In this way, we can begin to discard these thoughts, which act as lenses through which we view ourself and the world. \"In order to let go of something you must first know what it is.\" One dimension is not higher or lower than another dimension. One dimension can be clear (not pull \"your\" awareness) while others pull your awareness. For example, I gave a talk in Germany. Collapsing the levels kept coming up for people. There was a woman who talked about some guru in India and he kept telling her to \"focus (fixate) on me, look at me, focus on me, keep your mind on me. The only way to THAT is through me.\" So what you have here is a fusion of the VOID and his uncooked narcissism of the thinking and emotional dimension. One Tibetan guru, died of sclerosis of the liver from alcoholism. His life and death were subsequently spiritualized as \"crazy wisdom.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In order to expand our awareness and truly let go of limiting thoughts and beliefs, it's important to recognize the lenses through which we view ourselves and the world. By understanding and distinguishing different dimensions, we can gain a clearer perspective and avoid being pulled into unhelpful patterns of thought and behavior."
