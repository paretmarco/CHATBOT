  "title": "What is the importance of the Biological Core in Quantum Psychology and Yoga Systems?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, Quan discusses the importance of the BIOLOGICAL CORE, an essential dimension that needs to be worked with, acknowledged and explored. Here, he sheds light on how this relates to archetypes and biological spirituality, particularly in relation to the gravitational force of the sun and the earth. Quan also explores the application of this concept in various yoga systems and how, by being in one's core, one can achieve a state of pure being.",
  "content": "People's awareness must rest between the two in order to be permanently established in the awareness of unity or NOT-I-I (see Volume III). This is the true meaning of \"Honor your father (sun), the gravitational force, and your mother (earth), the gravitational force. This is biological spirituality. THE BIOLOGICAL CORE AND YOGA SYSTEMS Yoga systems often times require that in meditation you sit upright with your back totally straight. This posture should naturally be done from the core, not from the sleeve. When you are in your core, then there is a natural balancing between the gravitational pulls of the sun and the earth. There are no breakages, hence, no thoughtsâ€”or, as Ida Rolf said, no breakages no psychology. In this way, on a biological level there is the non-verbal I AM or pure BEINGNESS which is a no-state state and is a natural meditation (see Volume III). 150 Chapter VIII Actually by being in your core, meditation as an act or action is unnecessary.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, by understanding and practicing the biological spirituality of balancing the gravitational pulls of the sun and earth from the core rather than the sleeve, one can achieve a natural state of meditation and eliminate the need for forced techniques. This understanding can also help address biological and psychological breakages, leading to a greater sense of unity and true spirituality."
