  "title": "What are the different techniques of gazing and how can they be used in business and personal life?",
  "first_phrase": "In the previous section, we discussed the art of fascination and the power of gaze. In this final part, we will explore additional techniques to improve your interpersonal skills. One such technique involves looking at the mouth of the stomach to stimulate a decision, while imagining an eye and looking at the right eye of your subject. Another technique involves imagining small arrows going from your eyes to the eyes of the person you are looking at to improve focus. The school of fascination has many such techniques, and proper training and guidance can help develop these skills.",
  "content": "A useful exercise is to imagine some small arrows going from your eyes to the eyes of the person you are looking at. Practice this kind of training in different sessions in the same way and with the same energy you did when you practiced looking at the point for learning how not to blink. You will soon notice also an additional capacity to focus in all situations of your life. The school of fascination has hosts of these techniques, where specific imaginations and symbols will both increase the width of your pupil and at the same time put you in a specific mental state with absolute certainty. This concludes this practical introduction to the outer techniques of fascination. Further inner and additional techniques include among others energy training, proper breathing, hands movement, other gaze patterns and practical applications. We dedicate many time in our international trainings to these elements. We encourage you to practice these exercises with a friend in order to finely tune them. What you are undergoing is developing new interpersonal skills and abilities. A proper guide is also very useful.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, practicing the outer techniques of fascination such as arrow gaze and symbol visualization can enhance your interpersonal skills and abilities to focus in any situation. However, for further development and understanding, it's crucial to learn energy training, proper breathing, and other techniques. Don't hesitate to contact Dr. Marco Paret or visit his website for more guidance on this exciting journey of self-improvement."
