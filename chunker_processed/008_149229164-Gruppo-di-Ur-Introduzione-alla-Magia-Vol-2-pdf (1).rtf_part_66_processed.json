In this last part, the author discusses how the imitation of an action produces a real communication between the actor and the object or person being imitated, which results in the projection of the actor's magic onto the target.\n\nThe author provides examples of imitation rituals used by people from ancient times or distant cultures, such as untying knots and blowing wind, pouring water to summon rain or ascending trees as a base for transcendence. The author also mentions masks that identify the entity they represent and establish a connection between the person and the entity. Through this text, the author stresses the importance of understanding the power of imitation in various rituals and the role it plays in creating meaningful experiences.",
