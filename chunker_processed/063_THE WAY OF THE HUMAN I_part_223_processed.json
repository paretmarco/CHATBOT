  "first_phrase": "In this article, we explore the concept of the BIOLOGICAL CORE in Rolfing, a technique that aligns the body's structure with gravity. It is a physical core that aligns our biology with the earth and sun on a gravitational level through the vehicle of the body. We interviewed Jack Donnelly, a Rolfer with 29 years of experience, who explained that rthe Rolf line is where the primal and high cores meet. Rolf believed that psychology was a product of a breakage in the core. This realization leads to an understanding that the body is made of the same substance as everything else and is related to other spiritual practices.",
  "content": "According to Donnelly, It is the alignment around the BIOLOGICAL CORE (and it is a physical core not only energetic, like Yogis would say) that aligns the biology with earth and the sun on a gravitational level through the vehicle of the body. Rolf's statement has enormous ramifications in regard to what Quantum Psychology calls the realization of BIOLOGICAL ESSENCE. This experiential realization leads us to an understanding that the body is made of the same substance as everything else, and we begin to see the BIOLOGICAL CORE's relationship to other spiritual disciplines. For example, Taoist literature says something like, \"When heaven and earth are aligned, the Tao is realized. When heaven and earth are aligned balance will occur,\" or \"when heaven 136 Chapter VIII and earth are balanced, the true nature of the Tao [the way] will be revealed.\" I realized if we substitute the word Sun for the word heaven we have the true biological meaning of BIOLOGICAL CORE. In other words, \"when we realize and experience the effortlessness of the gravitational pull on a biological level between the Sun (heaven) and the earth, then we will experience alignment with The Way (The Tao).",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, aligning the biological core with the gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun through the vehicle of the body leads to the realization of biological essence and the natural alignment with the Tao. This alignment eliminates interruptions and breakages in the biological core, allowing for a state of effortlessness where past, present, and projected future body images are irrelevant. Focus on aligning your biological core for a deeper understanding of The Way."
