  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and the Purpose of the Trilogy: Discovering Who You Are?",
  "first_phrase": "In this last chapter of the \"Quantum Consciousness\" trilogy, the author reflects on the lifelong quest of self-discovery and provides an overview of the basic principles of Quantum Psychology. Volume I and II provide context to the trilogy and Volume III, \"Beyond Quantum Psychology,\" takes the reader on a journey beyond multi-dimensional awareness and dismantles awareness itself. The author encourages readers to take the quest in stages and to appreciate the surprise ending by reading each volume from the beginning.",
  "content": "Quantum Psychology encompasses psychology and Eastern and Middle Eastern religions along with Quantum Physics. This context peitnitted \"me\" to outline what is The Way of the Human ® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness called Quantum Psychology in Volumes I and II of the trilogy. In Volume III, however, not only multi-dimensional awareness (Volume I) and the False Core-False Self (Volume II) are gone beyond, but also awareness itself, along with Quantum Psychology, is dismantled and gone BEYOND. Before we get ahead of ourselves, however, it seems important, though perhaps unnecessary, to take this whole quest in stages. As we all know, this is not a linear process. On the contrary, we all get bursts of awareness, some coupled with experiences, some show us what is to come, or what is possible, and some take us beyond what we call ourselves. Hopefully, The Way of the Human, Quantum Psychology Notebooks (Volumes I and II) and Beyond Quantum Psychology (Volume III) can aid us in doing just that. It is for this reason that it is important to get an overview of what material each of the three Volumes contains.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a unique perspective on the purpose of psychology - to discover who we truly are at our core. Through developing multi-dimensional awareness, we can unravel the layers of our False Core-False Self and move beyond just awareness itself, into a new realm of understanding. The three volumes of The Way of the Human ® Developing Multi-Dimensional Awareness called Quantum Psychology provide a practical guide for this journey towards self-discovery."
