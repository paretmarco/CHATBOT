  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, we explore the concept of \"instant fascination\" and its therapeutic applications. This technique, also known as \"instant hypnosis,\" was developed by Erminio from Pisa and can alleviate physical pains, headaches, tinnitus, and other ailments. Through the power of his gaze, Erminio was able to fascinate and heal people in everyday life. We also discuss the importance of transcending the ego and the negative fascination that arises from man's ancestral fear of the unknown. Finally, we examine the efficacy of re-engaging with scary memories in eradicating fear and anxiety.",
  "content": "The disappearance of the symptom only takes place if the action which is engaged in so as to extirpate it takes place within a short period from the moment when the patient is presented again with the scary symptom; if such symptom is not reintroduced, or if the ‘fear-erasing’ training is conducted many hours later, the volunteering patients retain a trace of the fear. Put it in other words, they retain their fear of having to see the squares again. According to the researchers, this fact is explainable on the basis that when the fear is recreated, the memory associated with it crystallizes once more, precisely at that very moment where the memory is fragile and can be removed. It is important to observe the fact that the transcending of the ego which activates the fascination is an even more powerful tool, as it not only frees and eliminates a symptom, but, in several cases, makes room for a total rebalancing. If we want to express it in simpler terms, we might define the therapy of the look as “the positive fascination which chases away the negative fascination derived from life experiences”. The origin of problems It is the fears and anxieties which are intrinsic to man that create the “negative fascination”. Man in fact possesses an ancestral fear of the unknown, which thing pushes him into creating thought mechanisms aimed at concealing and overcoming this fear. The fear, however, is still there in his underlying being. Essentially put, therefore, man, in order to try and release himself from fear, becomes captivated by external concepts.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the therapy of the look defines the positive fascination that can help to eliminate negative fascination caused by fear and anxiety. The process of transcending the ego can lead to not only the elimination of a symptom but a total rebalancing. The usefulness of being detached from external fascination is highlighted by the comparison with the technique of Trataka. Moreover, the exercises mentioned in this text can help in magnetic look and positive speaking. It is important to practice them regularly in order to attain emotional control and calm."
