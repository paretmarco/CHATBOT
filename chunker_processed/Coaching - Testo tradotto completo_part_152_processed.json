  "title": "\"How to achieve emotional release, imperturbable equanimity, and avoid haste and anxieties?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens of this text, the author speaks about the importance of emotional release and the need to channel energy into useful areas, such as completing pending tasks. The author emphasizes the need to uproot anger and fear, denying their existence in the soul of the educated and sensible person. To attain the goal of imperturbable equanimity, presence and healthy attention to oneself are necessary. The author warns against haste and anxieties, urging readers to plan and be present in the moment. As Tao Te King noted, the avid desire destroys the possibility of movement.",
  "content": "What we need to acquire, for us to act well, is to gain, on a perpetual basis, the imperturbable equanimity of a profound spirit even if such spirit might superficially appear to be agitated. One can conversely witness a spirit which, though ostensibly imperturbable, deep inside is restless. In order to attain the said goal, presence is necessary. A healthy attention to ourselves will enable us to get rid of these foolish manias, by forcing us to focus our attentiveness on other people only to the extent that such undertaking might prove useful to us. Such a salutary attention to ourselves will additionally allow us to free our beings of the whole spectrum of prejudices, dead weights, and false sentimentalities which make us lose sight of the goal. Remember to study each and every case on its own, and to apply to it those procedures which are suitable to the specific case in question, rather than the ones that are suggested by theoretical prejudgment. Haste and Anxieties The avid desire destroys the possibility of movement (Tao Te King) Get rid of haste. If you plan your activity in advance and manage to be present in the moment, you will successfully find the time to do every thing.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, to act well, we need to cultivate a profound spirit of equanimity through a healthy attention to ourselves, thereby freeing ourselves from prejudices and false sentiments. We must study each case on its own and eliminate haste, anxieties, and repetitive habits to gain a huge saving of time and discover new experiences. By focusing on the present moment and embracing novelties, we can live a fulfilling life."
