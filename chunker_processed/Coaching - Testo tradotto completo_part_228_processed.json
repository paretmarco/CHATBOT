  "title": "\"How can you achieve your ideal life plan? Tips on organizing and coordinating your activities\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part, the author emphasizes the importance of following a vocation that originates within oneself and is founded on a full knowledge of one's nature and potential. It is crucial to trim down one's defects and highlight natural gifts after a detached self-critique. Organizing one's activities is essential to canalize one's forces and make profitable use of one's energies. The achievers are those who coordinate and subordinate their activities in an orderly arrangement, ensuring not a single one gets forgotten or lost. The author draws inspiration from an Eastern poet who compares an archer's aim to life goals. Every ideal or \"life plan\" must be based on the individual's unique nature and potentialities.",
  "content": "Became what you are (Pindar) Coordinating and subordinating The achievers are those who follow a vocation which originates in the depths of their beings, and which springs out of the observation of their harmonious balance with the Universe, with the result that they turn themselves into a reflection of it. Why? Because the vocation enables one to perceive the straight road ahead, which he is called upon to tread. Whoever, then, sacrifices everything to such vocation, will act almost as if in a state of somnambulism, his forces having been multiplied. In order, however, for this vocation to reach its ultimate goal, organization is required. Organizing your activity has the connotation of making profitable use of your energies. A waterfall fails to confer any strength unless and until the engineer has channelled it first. Put it differently, unless and until he organizes the power of the waterfall by directing it to a specific purpose. You must canalize your forces. Organizing bears the meaning of coordinating and subordinating. Coordinating: It is to lay activities in an orderly arrangement, in such a manner that not a single one of those activities gets forgotten or lost.",
  "last_phrase": "To become what you are meant to be, follow a vocation that aligns with your harmonious balance with the universe. To achieve this, organize your activity by coordinating and subordinating your actions, while also taking into account your environment to avoid neglecting crucial factors. Canalize your forces to make optimal use of your energies and avoid exhaustion, leading to a successful and fulfilling life journey."
