He then goes on to describe how a psychotherapist can use these phenomena to help the client identify the source of their current problem. In the last 200 tokens, the author showcases the work of renowned therapist Milton Erickson, who was a pioneer in using autonomous unconscious change to help clients overcome their symptoms.
