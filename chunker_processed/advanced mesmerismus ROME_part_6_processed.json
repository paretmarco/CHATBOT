  "first_phrase": "In the last 200 tokens, the focus is on creating ecstasy and activating the parasympathetic system through various techniques, including breathing, looking, and sound. The names of the exercises are mentioned, such as the \"blue pearl\" exercise, the Mirror exercise, and Taurus. The benefits and objectives of these exercises are clearly explained, including inducing deep trances, somnambulism, regressions, and nonverbal hypnosis. Magnetism techniques for overall wellbeing, quantum, and Hermetic paradigms are also touched. The text includes information on how to heal pains on the spine and sciatica, along with a general observation on the importance of the spine in our organism.",
  "content": "IN ROME THESE TWO EXERCISES HAVE BEEN FUSIONED IN ONE AND WE HAVE HAD THE PERSON FALL A LITTLE IN THE HANDS OF THE ASSISTANTS ========================================= In the former exercise we saw the passes to activate the spine These movements are the same that we can use to work after to heal the spine EXERCISE to heal pains on the spine USE: every pain on the spine, discopathy 1 - Ask the person where he feels pain 2 - Find the point feeling it even yourself 3 - Note - You can find the point even moving the hand along the spine and seeing where you have reactions 4 - Create a magnetic state (activate the parasympathetic system) 5 - Lay one hand over the occiput and the other one over the cocciput Dont touch We can even switch hands so we will see different reactions and how polarities will affect the results We will see a reaction in the spine After you will work on the point where is the pain RESULTS: the pain will go away =========================================== How to do with Sciatica? Practically the system is similar. Just we will add movement going down on the side where is the pain These movements we call \"butterfly movements\" because we will move the fingers doing them and we will join the thumbs that can also slightly touch the leg Go always backward Repeat one or two times RESULTS: no pain GENERAL OBSERVATION ON THE WORK OVER THE SPINE The spine is the basic pillar of our organism We worked on the energy going up.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, this exercise provides a practical approach to heal pain on the spine, discopathy, and sciatica. It also introduces techniques for inducing a magnetic state and closing the senses, along with nonverbal communication principles and hypnodrama methods to evoke emotional reactions. The goal is to bring the client to the center, using true archetypes and increasing their awareness to help them own themselves. The swaying test is then used to stimulate unconscious answers, making the client more reactive. Overall, these techniques can be useful for therapists and individuals seeking to improve their well-being."
