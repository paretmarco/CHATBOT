  "title": "What are the dangers of age-regression trance-terence in therapy and spiritual groups?",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author discusses the desire to model oneself after another person, which is a reenactment of early childhood behavior. The author identifies individuals who are good at modeling behaviors and fusing with others, such as therapists and spiritual leaders. The author argues that the creation of a false, grandiose self through trance-ference and the pursuit of a professional persona in therapy can be harmful to personal growth. The text concludes by citing Johnson's (1987) observation of the transformational psychology movement's propensity for grandiosity and its participants' identification with charismatic leaders.",
  "content": "In other words, rather than examining and dismantling their self-defeating tendencies, they create and take on an image of what a good therapist should do. For example, one Ericksonian trainer I knew had on his training brochure, \"Emphasis will be placed upon developing a professional persona.\" Many therapists and therapies are more interested in their image and persona than in being human. Recently, I have seen many different forms of therapy whose focus is on developing new strategies to handle relationships (with their mother, for example), rather than on dismantling their childlike identity which has a problem with Mom, because they are seeing her not as a human being and a person, but rather through the eyes of a child. 222 Special Section These are the trappings of the age-regression trance-Terence which is looking for a model. As Johnson (1987) says: Though I think there are many valuable ideas and strategies provided by the transformational psychology movement, I think that it is particularly prone to this form of error. Its ideology and claims for instant success are often characterized by grandiosity, and its participants sometimes appear to be great exemplars of \"transference\" cures based upon an unintegrated identification with an idealized charismatic leader.",
  "last_phrase": "In order to truly heal, it is important to dismantle our self-defeating tendencies and focus on being human. By doing so, we can avoid being trapped in the age-regression trance of seeking a perfect model and instead embrace our authentic selves. Let us be wary of charismatic leaders and instead prioritize our own personal growth and development."
