  "title": "\"How can changing the focus of attention relieve physical and emotional pain in therapy?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this text, the author shares a technique for handling sensory distortion in clients, which involves expanding the focus of attention beyond the location of a symptom. This technique is illustrated through two examples: one with a client experiencing migraine headaches and another with a client experiencing emotional pain in their stomach. By offering opposite or desirable sensations, the focus of attention is expanded and a third experience of sensation is achieved. The author suggests speeding up or slowing down sensations, suggesting different sensations, dispersing sensations throughout the body, and more as ways to handle sensory distortion. These techniques are based on Principle IX, which states that a trance is necessary to hold a symptom together.",
  "content": "Another example is a client who claimed he had only emotional pain in his life, and it focused in his stomach. I suggested that he might experience a desirable sensation in his hand or foot. He nodded. \"And a painful sensation in another part of your body?\" Nod. \"A pleasant sensation in another part of the body?\" Nod. \"A pleasant sensation in another part?\" Over time, by offering opposite or desirable sensations, we expanded his focus of attention, and he experienced himself in a varied way. To enhance his experience after the pleasant and unpleasant sensations were equal or balanced, I suggested that he notice the sensations moving. They moved into one another, merging and creating an integrated Sensory Distortion + 121 experience of both. This integration of pleasant and unpleasant experiences yielded a third experience of sensation, which was not available earlier. The Next Step Handling Sensory Distortion 1. Speed up or slow down the sensations, or expand and contract gaps between two sensations. 2. Differentiate the pain sensations by suggesting differ- ent sensations like sharp, burning, light, etc. 3. Suggest dispersing the sensations (energy) through the body equally. 4.",
  "last_phrase": "To handle sensory distortion, try various techniques such as speeding up or slowing down sensations, differentiating pain sensations, dispersing energy through the body, and more. Additionally, questioning the inner child's sensory experiences can help to uncover underlying issues and promote healing. Remember to locate where the inner child resides and ask questions to gain greater insight and understanding. By incorporating these steps, you can help yourself or your clients to experience a diverse range of sensations and integrated sensory experiences."
