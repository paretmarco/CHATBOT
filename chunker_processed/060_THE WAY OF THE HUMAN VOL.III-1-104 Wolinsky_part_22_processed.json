  "first_phrase": "In the preceding part of the text, Wolinsky helps individuals discover their False Core and ask it what they seek the most. Ted realized that he is love, and in the following demonstrations, Wolinsky guides his students to identify their False Core seeking and understand the emptiness fused with aloneness. In demonstration #4, a student discovers that the False Core seeking love is appreciation, and in demonstration #5, Alice feels a wavy sensation while trying to detach the chains associated with an empty space fused with aloneness. Ultimately, the goal is to understand the False Core's insignificance and beyond Quantum Psychology.",
  "content": "________________ DEMONSTRATION #5 Alice:When I do this, I can feel a flow of ESSENCE but I hold onto the False Core, too. Wolinsky:Get a sense of the flow for right now. Notice the BIG EMPTY SPACE. And notice all the chains that get associated with that in your life. Notice the size and shape of the empty space and all of its chains. Ask the EMPTY SPACE which is fused with aloneness, \"What are you seeking more than anything else in the world?\" Alice:It says love. Therapeutic Note Here we are trying to get as NON-VERBAL as possible by moving beyond her concept of love since love was fused with alone. Alice:It's like this wavy feeling. It's like I'm just trying to show what it feels like. Wolinsky:How does the False Core seem to you from inside that wavy? The Way of the Human â€¢ Beyond Quantum Psychology Alice:Pretty insignificant.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, the exercise aimed to help Alice detach from the false core and focus on the flow of essence, identifying the chains associated with the empty space she felt. By shifting focus away from verbal concepts such as love, the exercise aimed to delve into nonverbal experiences, leading to a feeling of insignificance for the false core, and ultimately helping Alice find peace with newfound awareness."
