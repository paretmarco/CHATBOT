  "title": "\"What is the significance of the I AM in Quantum Psychology and Nisargadatta Maharaj's teachings?\"",
  "first_phrase": "This article explores the role of I AM in quantum psychology and how it relates to the False Core-False Self concept, as taught by Nisargadatta Maharaj. Prior to I AM lies the root of False Core-False Self and un-fusing I AM can help make that cut. I AM is an Archetype and eventually disappearing leads to a quantum leap. Quantum Psychology helps stabilize awareness and establish one's presence without retreating from the world. It doesn't seek to change beliefs or create new ones but, rather, to focus on the concept of I AM and Beyond.",
  "content": "Maharaj's premise is that you start from I AM and use it as a pointer, understanding it is the seed of your personal consciousness. As I mentioned previously, the process of just being I AM and letting go of everything else while living in the world, having relationships, holding down a job, etc., was very difficult for this \"me\" and \"I\" imagine it is difficult for most people. For that reason, Quantum Psychology emerged to help this process and to stabilize awareness. When its theory is applied, it might help \"you\" to be established, stabilized and rest into your own presence without retreating from the world. It should also be noted that Quantum Psychology is not interested in changing maps or beliefs or in re-programming or substituting one set of beliefs for another. Actually, Quantum Psychology 76 Chapter dismantles psychology and spirituality. Oftentimes, Quantum Psychology does not, like psychology and oftentimes spirituality, lead to a \"new\" beliefs or frames of reference but rather to the I AM and Beyond; hence, NO FRAMES OF REFERENCE, NO REFERENCES TO FRAME.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a unique path to personal consciousness and the understanding of the seed of one's being. Through dismantling, rather than changing or reprogramming, it helps individuals establish and stabilize their presence in the I AM, without retreating from the world. By rooting in the question \"Who am I?\", Quantum Psychology provides a practical and transformative method for those seeking to rest in their own presence and beyond."
