  "title": "What is Quantum Psychology and how does it challenge one's sense of self?",
  "first_phrase": "The last part of this passage, comprising 200 tokens, delves into the nature of Quantum Psychology, a discipline that synthesizes Western psychology with principles of Quantum Physics. It provides a 'way' to question presuppositions, assumptions, and lies about one's identity by employing a rigorous inquiry-based approach. The text underlines that Quantum Psychology is not for everyone, and encourages people to use techniques until they can swim on their own.",
  "content": "The presuppositions, conclusions and assumptions, the stories, and lies about who you are and who you are not are taken apart so that they can be seen for what they are: misinformation. Then not only do all the old presuppositions and premises disappear but also the \"you\" you called yourself. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to say, \"What you know about yourself came from outside of you, therefore discard it.\" The enquiry and questions used are the tools which provide a \"way\" to follow Maharaj's premise, \"Question everythingâ€”do not believe anything.\" It should also be noted that many \"Advaitists\" feel that the use of any kind of \"technique\" presupposes an \"I\" which does it. Quantum Psychology appreciates this, however, knowing that ultimately both the enquirer-enquiree naturally disappear. For this reason, Quantum Psychology suggests that you not give up your boat [techniques] on the sea of existence until you know how to swim. It should also be borne in mind that Quantum Psychology is not for everybody. In fact, \"I\" often discourage people from taking workshops and turn people down if \"I\" don't think it's right for them.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, Quantum Psychology offers a way to question and discard the misinformation and presuppositions that create a false sense of self. While it may not be suitable for everyone, the use of techniques can help individuals navigate the sea of existence until they learn to swim on their own. It is important to remember to approach the process without any intention of a specific outcome and to dismantle the false core/false self before addressing #8."
