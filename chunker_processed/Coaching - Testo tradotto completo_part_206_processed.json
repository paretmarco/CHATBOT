  "title": "\"What is the importance of balancing Chronos and Kairòs for a fulfilling and successful life?\"",
  "first_phrase": "The text explores the importance of balancing Chronos and Kairòs, two different concepts of time that complement one another. Chronos is the structure of the day, while Kairòs is the distilled quintessence of the day, representing the free vital force in the now. By maintaining a presence and enjoyment of the now and acting in the present, we can reach new opportunities and unveil our potential. Predicting the future is pre-imagining, like seeing events in a movie. With this in mind, the last part of the text delves into the notion of making the movie of the future, living in the moment, and finding success through balance.",
  "content": "Ideal-based or life plan (It provides support for the other levels and defines them) ? ? ? Always present: Energy and existential attitude (Presence and enjoyment of the now and of acting in the now) ? ? Chronos and Kairòs are thus complementary. Regardless of how many opportunities and interests life might offer us (kairòs), if we are unable to function sequentially we shall waste them away, inasmuch as we will lack the capacity to grant a sequitur to such opportunities and interests (chronos). Kairòs is a vertical dimension which gets connected with the horizontal dimension of chronos, as if to create a + cross with it. Ideation, which corresponds to the horizontal line, comes into the picture here in the form of a logically conceived plane which is inspired by the absolute will to actualize it. The aforesaid further gets rid of preoccupation in one go. If, in fact, we know how to reach a result, there is no longer any reason to fear in the present. We might rather be able to live the present fully, and thereby unveil new opportunities. Making the movie of the future Predicting is pre-imagining. It is to see events as if in a movie.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, balancing kairòs and chronos and ideation with a life plan enables us to live fully in the present while also making plans to achieve our goals. By visualizing our future like a movie and channeling our energy towards our desired action, we can prevent external distractions from derailing us. Ultimately, connecting with our inner being and realizing our ideal provides a firm goal to strive for and prevents us from straying away from our path. Remember that the key to success lies in understanding ourselves, planning ahead, and enjoying life in the present moment."
