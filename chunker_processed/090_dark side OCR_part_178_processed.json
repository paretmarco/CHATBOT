  "title": "\"What is Identity Dreaming and Amnesia in the Inner Child? How to Address and Overcome Them?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the final part of this text, the focus is on identifying the needs of the inner child through identity dreaming and dealing with amnesia or denial. The author suggests asking oneself about unfulfilled needs and being willing to ask for them in present relationships. The text explains that amnesia or denial is a protective mechanism of the inner child to avoid uncomfortable situations, and it can manifest in different ways. It is essential to recognize and address these issues to overcome them.",
  "content": "Try this for a week, and write down what feelings arose and how others' responded to you. For example, if you ask for affection this week, fear might arise. Also, how did you see others respond to your direct request? Summary Identity dreaming, a sub-set of dreaming, aids the individual during times of stress. It is only a problem when the inner child acts autonomously and treats the present as the past, outside of the control and awareness of the sleeping observer. â€¢12 Amnesia Amnesia, often referred to as denial, is a trance that can operate on its own without the adult' s conscious control in present time. The child within, experiences this trance as a way of protecting himself from uncomfortable situations. * Here are several styles of amnesia. 1. Self-deceptive amnesia, manifests when the child within the adult forgets to remember a situation. An example of this might be an adult child of an alcoholic who forgets his parent's drinking. 2. Deletion, or leaving out appropriate information dur- ing communicative interactions, allows a non-committal statement that could be interpreted in a variety of ways. Simple statements like, \"You know how it feels when things happen.\"",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, identifying and understanding patterns of amnesia can help individuals recognize and address their inner child's protective behavior. Trying this for a week and observing personal reactions and others' responses can aid in identifying these patterns. Seek professional help if severe amnesia persists or causes concern."
