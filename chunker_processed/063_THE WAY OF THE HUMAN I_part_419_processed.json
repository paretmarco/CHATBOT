  "title": "What are some influential books on spirituality, psychology, and physics?",
  "first_phrase": "This text explores the concept of wholeness and the implicit order, as proposed by physicist David Bohm. Referencing various works in psychology and physics, the author delves into the topic of the unthought known or shadow, its importance for individualization and religious function, and how it correlates with the Eastern philosophy of Buddhism. With influences from scholars such as Edward Edinger, Christopher Bollas, and Fritjof Capra, among others, the text offers a unique and thought-provoking perspective on the interconnection between the mind and universe.",
