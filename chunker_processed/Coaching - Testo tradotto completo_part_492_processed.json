  "title": "\"What is self-sabotage in trading and how can you break its cycle?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In the preceding text, the author discusses the concept of self-sabotage in trading activities, which stems from negative beliefs absorbed from the environment. In the last 200 tokens, the author gives a practical example of how self-sabotage can lead traders to destructive behavior, similar to some rock singers who self-destructed after achieving success. Thus, when success is within reach, traders lose sight of their aim and begin risking too much, leading to their own downfall. This behavior is characterized by a chain of justifications that make it hard to break the trance.",
  "content": "The way they had been programmed mentally was so strong that, given that the external environment did not destroy them, they elected to destroy themselves. That is the identical scenario applying to some traders who, when they are faring well in their activity, begin to embark on increasingly more risky operations, until they eventually cause their own destruction. In essence, their drama is that when success draws near their persons, they lose sight of their aim. A characteristic feature of this trance consists, moreover, in a chain of “because”, the effect of which is to make it hard to break the trance in its initial stages, insofar as the trader finds external justifications for his failures. The logical mind is in fact characterized by the tendency to work on the basis of inferences, i.e. deductively, as a result of which it is inclined to justify somehow certain beliefs which have instead been simply assimilated from one's parents or from the environment generally.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, it is imperative to recognize that success is not solely attributed to luck but also to one's ability to take on responsibilities and avoid falling into the trap of justifying failures with external circumstances. By breaking the chain of \"because\" and becoming accountable for our own actions, we can avoid the destructive path that befalls traders and managers who lose sight of their goals and succumb to their mental programming."
