  "first_phrase": "In this text, we explore how expectations drive financial market decisions through the lens of visual perception. The article emphasizes that people's expectations are shaped by their personal experiences and convictions, which influence their interpretation of external information received through sensory faculties like vision and hearing. The last 200 tokens delve deeper into how these perceptions can lead to a hypnotic state, blinding investors to the reality of the market. This section highlights the importance of understanding the subjective nature of reality and expectations in making informed trading decisions.",
  "content": "The latter, in term, depend on the manner in which we elaborate information that reaches us from without through such sensory faculties as sight, hearing, and coenesthesia (bodily sensations); we also use taste and smell, but only to a lesser extent In other words, we do not perceive the world directly. What we actually perceive is our own imagine of the world, which is an image that varies from person to person. Every individual, in fact, constructs his own reality on the basis of which type of experiences he has had in life. We apply, to those experiences that are classified through the senses and the system of representation, a whole assortment of assumptions, generalizations, deformations, and obliterations. All these essentially consist in ways by which reality is narrowed down. They are state of trances we are unaware of. It is therefore possible, for every single person, to perceive the reality of financial markets in different ways, by creating his own subjective convictions on the strength of which he is going to adopt lines of conduct eventually leading him to specific expectations.",
  "last_phrase": "In conclusion, our perception of the world is not a direct experience but rather a construction of our own reality based on our past experiences and assumptions. Similarly, our perception of financial markets can be subjective and influenced by our beliefs and expectations. It is important to be aware of our biases and be ready to change our views in order to avoid falling into the trap of the \"hypnotic dream\" and achieve success in the markets."
