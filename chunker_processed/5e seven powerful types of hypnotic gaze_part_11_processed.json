  "title": "\"How can different forms of gaze enhance hypnotic induction?\"",
  "first_phrase": "In this final section, the author discusses advanced techniques for hypnotic induction, specifically focusing on the power of gaze. They explain how alternating gaze between the eyebrows and the tip of the nose, or using a more confusing gaze by alternating focus between the eyes and nose, can help induce a hypnotic state. Additionally, the author describes an advanced technique for adding depth to one's gaze, which can access the primal mind. They mention famous individuals who used this gaze successfully, like Greta Garbo and Rodolfo Valentino.",
  "content": "Another way of doing is alternating between looking at the right eye, at the left eye, and finally the nose. This kind of gaze will cause a sort of \"confusion\" in your subject. The confusion will normally happen in the same moment you will look at the nose. Try these methods at the beginning of your hypnotic inductions. - How to add depth of gaze and speak to the primal mind This advanced kind of hypnotic gaze gives the impression you are looking very deep inside your partner, and a variation of it is also used for some types of mysterious \"hypnotic robberies\" as I have demonstrated recently in a TV show. It deeply entrances and speaks to the most interior mind of man that we could call \"primal mind\". You have to focus behind the subject. For doing it well, you need to imagine that his/her head is transparent. Developing this capacity is useful also for everyday life. Greta Garbo had a similar gaze due to an ocular problem and this is what gave rise to the fame of her powerful eyes. Even Rodolfo Valentino had a similar gaze.",
  "last_phrase": "By mastering these advanced hypnotic gazes, you can tap into the primal mind of your subjects and create a powerful connection. Additionally, using simple techniques like looking at the chin can also give the impression of depth. So why not expand your vision and explore the full potential of your hypnotic abilities?"
