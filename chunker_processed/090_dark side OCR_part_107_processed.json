  "first_phrase": "This text discusses the impact of the inner child's negative self-talk on adults. The previous part of the text delves into the concept of the inner child and how it can shape an individual's behavior. In the final 200 tokens, the text focuses on \"should\" voices, which are often considered parental injunctions, and how they can limit an individual's behavior. The text provides a structured approach to handling these voices and concludes with an exploration of inner dialogues and their effect on an adult's behavior.",
  "content": "If he does what he wants, the result is guilt, if he does what he should (the parental voice), he feels frustrated at not getting what he wants. The key thing to note is that the inner child has fused with \"should\" voices that actually belong to the parents. Handling the Shoulds Step I:Notice that the should voice is occurring. Step II: Notice where in the body the voice is coming from. Step III: Notice whose voice it is, Mom, Dad, brother, sister, etc. Step IV: Intentionally create the voice several times and experience the voice as energy. Step V: Notice you are the observer observing the voices.. Inner Dialogues can be voices inside, consciously or uncon- sciously, that the inner child repeats to herself, creating problem states. In this case, they fuse the adult in the child trance. These are two sides of the inner child: (1) the child, and (2) the parent, both living inside the adult in present time. A re-enforcement of the inner dialogue occurs within the family.",
  "last_phrase": "By following the steps outlined in Handling the Shoulds, you can learn to identify and understand the \"should\" voices in your inner dialogue, which may be reinforcing negative self-talk. By becoming an observer of your inner voices, you can begin to break free from the fusion of your inner child and parent voices, leading to a more positive and empowering inner dialogue."
